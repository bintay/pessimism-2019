@TommyFPatterson hockey or basketball?
@heyradar I'm jealous.
Meat biscuit FTW!  
@AyeBP @natediggy75 @AngieBritt best guess ever made.
@JessiSheron that's the best page yet!
@Partylikker @mkmcanin is BBQ a carb?
@stjepansejic Freddie!
@TheBurnham I hate that!
@mr_gause @Skinnypalmer yes. One of those. One of those.
@CarbonSwap @muse @garbage yes!
@MeTweetForFood fools
@MeTweetForFood this is important...
@mkmcanin @jdison92 Veronica Mars FTW!
@Schweinehaus Looks good either way
@Schweinehaus Isn't "pickled cucumber" just  a pickle?
@Skalded @AngieBritt @natediggy75 @mkmcanin There are a lot of idiots that also hold that honor.
@mkmcanin @Skalded @natediggy75 @AngieBritt Best thing about last night.  Possibly the only good thing.
@Partylikker @missbekah She said they won't move around.  They just chew one patch bald before moving to the next one.
@Partylikker @missbekah My soul was crushed that day...
@AngieBritt @Skalded @natediggy75 @mkmcanin I accidentally typed "their" instead of "they're" and I'm still kicking myself.
@missbekah @Partylikker I was very disappointed when someone who owned a goat told me they don't effectively keep a lawn trimmed.
@Skalded @natediggy75 @AngieBritt @mkmcanin I'm mortified when I make typos. I usually try to blame autocorrect, but it's usually dumb me.
@Skalded @natediggy75 @AngieBritt @mkmcanin I said, "screw making him mad, it's wrong!!"
@Skalded @natediggy75 @AngieBritt @mkmcanin I remember correcting Wookiee with you (that's sounds dirty). MeTweet said I'd make you mad.
@Skalded @natediggy75 @AngieBritt @mkmcanin I'm a geek.  Spelling of imaginary things is a pet peeve of mine.
@dilleweed Ender's Game?  It's pretty good.
@natediggy75 @AngieBritt @mkmcanin LOL
@mkmcanin I think this all the time.
@natediggy75 @AngieBritt @mkmcanin Fozzie is awesome
@Skalded @AngieBritt Lasts longer, more side effects, so yup.
@AngieBritt Not recommended for kids anymore, so none in the office.

That's essentially morphine, though...
@JShin_901 @BeauregardJones TRUTH
Why is there no alcohol in this pediatrics office?!
@BeauregardJones I made Matt Moore butthurt because I asked why people followed him.
@AngieBritt It's my own fault.  I didn't think it out very well.
Dear god.  I wasn't expecting someone else to favorite the Hasselhoff tweet.  I was eating.
@bellmemphis @jenxhawkins Definitely agree with that one.
@heyradar Apparently, it's all meaningless.
My 2:15PM patients just showed up.
@mkmcanin @Uncle_Buckin Did you eat him?
@fredvanlente This intrigues me...
@natediggy75 what's going on?
@BeaconPlenty @jenxhawkins I hate it so much.  Why?  Dude has Grizz in his avi but just puts them down all the time.
@heyradar @CBradyMem So, really important emails are forwarded to multiple personal accounts and printed out.
@heyradar @CBradyMem I keep EVERYTHING.  It has paid off multiple times.  I'm also a total nut because my employer controls the email server
@HPbasketball I had no idea you would see it since you had blocked me for responding to someone who had quoted you. No idea you unblocked.
poor @KateeForbis is a one woman self pep talk machine on Twitter today.
@mkmcanin Welcome to the "future"

Still no flying cars.
@jenxhawkins @skalded That is the epitome of understatement.
@jenxhawkins At least I hope his is his schtick.
@jenxhawkins Nah. You're a character.  That's different.  (I mean that is a good way, I promise.)  It's your schtick. Like @skalded is nuts.
@HPbasketball Why is that a problem for you?
@HPbasketball Okay...

I never said it wasn't. I just asked people I talk to why they want to follow a debbie downer. I have that right.
@mikefromemphis @Tigerblueblood It's a miracle!!!
@HPbasketball YES.  The world is shit enough as it is.  Why be doom and gloom?

Realism is overrated.
@HPbasketball It's not a problem.  They're also free to follow you.  I just don't get it.
@HPbasketball I just find it odd.  All I've heard from the Grizz fans I follow lately is how negative you have been.  RTs show it too.
@HPbasketball You're perfectly in your right to write whatever you want to write.  When people RT the negative stuff, I ask why even follow?
@HPbasketball Nothing. I don't follow you. I just don't understand why people want to follow one who often has such a gloom and doom view.
@mkmcanin I've never followed him, so I guess I've only seen the negative tweets. Never really paid attention until this postseason.
@mkmcanin He's just so negative about the Grizzlies.
@mkmcanin That's like saying which child is your favorite...

Gonna go with Tale Spin
@Tigerblueblood @mikefromemphis see, I just read it as he drank the iPhone
Apparently, he unblocked me.  I suppose that will change shortly.
Seriously, why does ANYONE follow @HPbasketball 

(who blocked me simply for asking someone why anyone follows him?)
@mkmcanin @dilleweed Tweetdeck is only on a computer, I believe.
@dilleweed @mkmcanin funny, though.  The Tweetdeck site tells you what app and device people are using.
@dilleweed @mkmcanin iPhones are the devil.
@mkmcanin I like it a lot better than the regular Twitter website.
@KateeForbis boomerang fish, even.
I'm very excited that I can see gifs on TweetDeck on my computer now that Chrome crashed and restarted.
@Skalded @mikefromemphis Disturbingly entertaining.
@KateeForbis If we're talking about the minor characters then it's either Crazy Harry or Lew Zealand.
@mkmcanin Angry Beavers were awesome!!

Fledgeling Cartoon Network shows were the best though. Cow and Chicken; Sheep in the Big City, etc.
I didn't think out the Hasselhoff tweet very well as Tweetdeck shows the pic everytime someone favs or RTs...
@mkmcanin 
@KateeForbis 'tis hard to make an empty bag stand upright.
@mkmcanin Something else I had to pirate.  DVDs are out of print.  Love me some Muppet Babies.
@mkmcanin Animal
@mistressmousey yeah, that was the strength of the original. Worked on several levels.

Huh.
@AyeBP excellent!
@mkmcanin there are no words...
@mkmcanin WHAT IN THE HOLY HELL?
@maggieb94 @mkmcanin High school was 16 years ago for me...
@maggieb94 @mkmcanin You're evil...
@TAismyhomeboy @KateeForbis Yeah, but then, I'd have to wait for it to ship.  We saw a Redbirds game on Sunday and decided to watch it then.
@AyeBP *not sure if I used that correctly
@AyeBP yuhhhhh
@badunclep @mkmcanin I just play one on Twitter.
@KateeForbis Not on VUDU, Amazon, Netflix, Google, nothing.  Not available digitally.

Might be on iTunes, but Apple is the devil.
@Skalded @mkmcanin College, med school, residency, and 3 different systems after starting my job.  Total pain in the ass.
@TAismyhomeboy @KateeForbis Aidan loved it too.  I wasn't about to drive to Walmart/Best Buy and rummage around their bins.
@Skalded @mkmcanin I've literally been in the "go from paper to electronic" transition at every step of my life.  It sucks.
Speaking of "The Sandlot", if a company doesn't want me to pirate a movie, then make it available digitally... 
@MeghanShelby @Skalded I thought it was canceled years ago...
@mkmcanin This makes me feel old because I graduated med school 8 years ago.  EIGHT YEARS AGO!!!
@badunclep LOL
@BenTBrown @_benchristian_ I love Lazarus, but I've only read the first arc.
@BenTBrown @_benchristian_ I have Wicked + Divine #1-6 or so on my Nook but I haven't gotten around to reading yet. East of West is the best
@Skalded @_benchristian_ You're gonna love it.  The Rangers are the best part.  Issue #6 I believe is the best one.
@_benchristian_ Yeah, I've heard all of his Marvel stuff has been leading up to Secret Wars, so I'm gonna try to read it all soon.
@CBradyMem We will always stay weird.  Weird is so much better than the alternative.

I'll let her know.
@_benchristian_ I'm about half way through that.  I got distracted and haven't gotten back to it yet.
@_benchristian_ Hickman is definitely my favorite.  Manhattan Projects is awesome, but East of West has a cooler story.
By the way, anyone wanting an update on MeTweet - her body ejected a facehugger this morning, so I think that's improvement.
Okay, @_benchristian_ Let's talk comics.  Favorite current book being produced?

Mine is East of West by a large margin.
@dilleweed @AyeBP @mkmcanin I'm sure we're both hungry enough to eat two helpings of each.
@dilleweed @mkmcanin sounds good!
@AyeBP @mkmcanin I'm feeling teriyaki today.
@mkmcanin I don't think anyone is bringing you a pizza.  

In related news, I still want brownies.  And wings.
@dilleweed @mylifeisdelish @space_baby_ ah.  Sorry.
@dilleweed @mylifeisdelish @space_baby_ &lt;sarcasm&gt;
@mylifeisdelish @space_baby_ This guy is a gem.
Rolling into work blasting Toccata and Fugue in D minor because Fuck Tuesday. 
I want brownies
GrizzNation, here's a fun game to distract ourselves with for a while...  
@CBradyMem as someone who does this habitually in life, I have no explanation. I only have 2 settings: half-assed and balls-to-the-wall
@JessiSheron I seriously don't know of how you're doing this well. Me and my son lose our minds after a few hours away from my wife.
@CBradyMem guess Joerger didn't get the memo that we're 13-1 against GSW when Mike and Tony BOTH play 20+ minutes. But whatever...
@KateeForbis yup. At the tunnel after his post-game interview.
@maggieb94 at least you got some Leuer minutes to watch...
Also, I swear I wasn't the one that poured ice on Steph Curry...
So, @MeTweetForFood turned a 180 in the lobby and shouted down some Warriors fans.
@ahubes1023 I am gonna beat the shit out of every single one of them
FUCK ALL Y'ALL LEAVING THIS PLACE.
@mikefromemphis @JimmySpencerNBA Fuck that guy
@heyradar @space_baby_ @CBradyMem Carol broke quarantine.
@AngieBritt what a cutie!
@ChrisVernonShow @AyeBP @SamGleneck yes!!
@theRealHrdlicka Joerger is smoking crack for sure.
This is being used out of context, but it applies to GSW, this game, and @NBAOfficial  
@notthefakeRed I'd pull down my pants and piss on the whole bench.
If we lose this game. It's on Joerger. What are these lineups?
@jmj1757 we have a Zbo and a CLee. Better than Vince and Green at the same time.
Why do we have March Joerger now?
@BeauregardJones they already know if they live with him.
@mkmcanin TONY BROTHERS
@missbekah @Partylikker @mkmcanin that's pretty funny.
@Partylikker @missbekah @mkmcanin I feel like I missed something funny.
@HydeParkSwag @Partylikker lol

"How did you know I live in Collierville???"
@space_baby_ @mkmcanin same here. And @MeTweetForFood made it!
@_benchristian_ sure thing!

FAV for @warriors 
@MeTweetForFood I got your back. I'm sure we can use @heyradar's beard as well.
@topcowmatt these are wonderfully hopeful predictions, dude...

#walkingdead #brony #mlp #michonne #zombie … ht…
It just keeps getting more awesome!  
@jmj1757 "wisdom teeth purr" sounds like a bad porno title.
@AngieBritt it is the correct decision. Only live once, and all that jazz.
@SainAsylum @RexBrown85 Yes!!
@_benchristian_ she's gonna give it a go!
@natediggy75 I'm doing better, as is Aidan, but she's really bad. She said she thinks she can make it.
@natediggy75 we've all been really sick lately. I probably was too sick to go Saturday. We went to Redbirds yesterday and left early.
@natediggy75 definitely
Yay!!! I saw all the patients!! Now to see if my wife is going to the Grizz game or the hospital.

#hopingitsnothospital
@natediggy75 Always.
@natediggy75 I see. Sounds like you had fun.
@natediggy75 Why?
@jmj1757 Where is this?
@KateeForbis @Skalded Isn't he a bot?
@KateeForbis @Skalded @AyeBP @ViewFromBoxSeat Doctors can't help Skalded, I'm afraid. It's documented very well on here.
@Partylikker @AyeBP LOL
@flwrgrl1978 I see.  good to know.
@flwrgrl1978 I don't know these words.  That bothers me.

#walkingdead #brony #mlp #michonne #zombie #bronies #pegasister #mylittl… ht…
@RayBanActual LOL

They're like Candyman.
@missbekah @mylifeisdelish But that's because the Manson family is normal compared to mine.
@missbekah @mylifeisdelish I see. MeTweet is the middle child, but born last.  Her family is pretty screwed up. They seemed normal to me.
@missbekah @mylifeisdelish What?
@Skalded @mkmcanin @space_baby_ This thread is very Zen.
So, Spider-Man would be a pretty awesome basketball player.
@alcohollelujah @mkmcanin @jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant Inconclusive. He is one of my followers.
@ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin @jmj1757 Really like VAST
@ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin @jmj1757 I like Dream Theater
@_benchristian_ Likewise.
@ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin @jmj1757 Weezer is great.
@mkmcanin @ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 Rush is one of my favorite bands.  Even if they are Canadian.
@mkmcanin @jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant She speaks the truth.  Freddie Mercury is a god.
@mkmcanin @jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant Queen for sure.  Cheap Trick is maybe top 15 or 20.  Hanson... We'll just ignore that one for now.
@mkmcanin @jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant VERY FALSE. The Stones are a crappy band who happen to have created a few of the greatest songs of all time
@KateeForbis My dog?
@ReynoldsRant You've summed up AC/DC fairly well, I believe. They are best enjoyed in a raucous place with the volume up high. Alcohol helps
@ReynoldsRant Are you sure the words are different?
@ReynoldsRant Best trash band.  Bon Jovi is the Taco Bell of bands. I shouldn't, but I love it.
@KateeForbis @Skalded Definitely.
@mylifeisdelish Nah.  I say stick with you.  You're good.
@RayBanActual @Skalded @KateeForbis Well done.  Strong work.
@Skalded @RayBanActual @KateeForbis facepalm
@mylifeisdelish Normal humans are vastly overrated.
@Skalded @KateeForbis This is fact.
@tattoosandbones It's probably closer than Russia is from Palin's house.
@tattoosandbones But 0.07!!!!  That's really close!
@KateeForbis I'm just messing wit ya.
@KateeForbis LOL

#walkingdead #brony #mlp #michonne #zombie #bronies #… ht…
@KateeForbis @Skalded Those plant mothers are totally pissed at that comment.
@kellonmusgrove5 @MeTweetForFood Happy Birthday!  Hopefully you'll get a Grizz win, too!
@KateeForbis Probably.  Vegans are the worst.
@badunclep keep a cool booty
@AyeBP @Grizzfanatic23 @KateeForbis @MeTweetForFood knew I could count on you, man.
@Grizzfanatic23 @KateeForbis @MeTweetForFood I'll put anything in my body.

*waits for @AyeBP *
@heyradar @KateeForbis @MeTweetForFood That tweet probably gave her some sort of powers or something.
@KateeForbis @MeTweetForFood It's delicious
@heyradar I think that's a watch towel, not a towel watch
I'm enjoying the live-tweeting of @KateeForbis descent into madness.
@KateeForbis Believe Memphis will be on the towels Saturday when we close out.

#Iamfromthefuture
@tankboy925 LOL

NOT MY BABY!!!
Door Hinge?

That's a weird motto 
@KateeForbis These are thicker and clearly the source cloth they're cut from is yellow.
@KateeForbis This year, they seem higher quality.  Every other year they were clearly white towels that were dyed yellow later.
@mikefromemphis @natediggy75 Unfortunately, not.  Interesting aside: my nephew went to middle school with a girl named Tequlia Sunrise.
@natediggy75 likely
Gotta love it when the baby smells like weed.
@mkmcanin Definitely
@mylifeisdelish This is an interesting self pep talk.
@BeauregardJones This makes it interesting.
Maybe they say "CRUSH THEM" 
@3SOB It's the best, because it's true.
"What do you want it to be?"
The statistician went in next.  When the question was posed to him, he
looked around furtively, shut the door and drew the blinds closed...
When the physisict went in, he was asked the same question:

Q: "What is two plus two?"
A:  "Four."
When the engineer went in, he was asked:

Q: "What is two plus two?"
A:  "Four."
Speaking of statistics, a joke:

Three people answered an ad for an open job - an engineer, a
physicist and a statistician.
@Partylikker I'll have to do the math...
@space_baby_ It says Clippers most likely (at like 67% or something) and Warriors second.
@space_baby_ "basketball power index" - I think Hollinger created it.  It predicts we have only an 8.7% of winning the title this year.
Actually, most statistics can go to hell.
BPI (the statistic) can go to hell.
@maggieb94 My voice is failing so I'm probably gonna make a variety of posters to communicate my discontent with the refs.
RE: Tony Brothers
@BenTBrown @BeauregardJones Idiots.
@BeauregardJones Ah, what do doctors know anyway?
@AyeBP The mac and cheese definitely.  The cone wasn't that bad though.
@Tigerblueblood @heyradar Good point
This thing is awesome!  I had it during the last home game of the first series. 
@Tigerblueblood @heyradar Before of after Zach's term?
@heyradar @Bret_Weaver If 10 people were trapped on a desert island with him, he'd be the only one they found alive.  And he'd be thriving.
@Tigerblueblood @heyradar If that's it, then Tony should just be Grizz marketing director in retirement.
@heyradar Awwww man.  It didn't even occur to me.
@Bret_Weaver @heyradar Aidan's our knife fighter
@heyradar No way, man.  This stomach was formed on months old questionable food products.  Potted meat as well. My family was into heatlh.
Verdict: diablo sauce = delicious.

Prefer chicken doubledilla to steak.
'bout to try some of this diablo sauce on this steak doubledilla.

Not food.  It's medicine.
Family update for game: Me and Aidan look to be likely.  MeTweet is a game-time decision.

I may have to slap some titanium in her face.
@jmj1757 We need to make this happen!
@jmj1757 which one?
@grizzlam did you kill Joe?
@jmj1757 @mkmcanin I love crawfish.  It's very similar to shrimp.
@notthefakeRed @mkmcanin 
@notthefakeRed @mkmcanin now I gotta listen to Princes of the Universe...
@dilleweed good plan
@AyeBP That's a great end to that story of a crappy human being.
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin @Tigerblueblood Yeah, whatever.  I bet y'all eat mushrooms.  They're neither plant nor animal - ain't right
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @mkmcanin @Tigerblueblood I was very hesitant to try them, but they are very very good.
Hey!  Look!  A patient!
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @mkmcanin @Tigerblueblood snails are awesome!
@Skalded @mkmcanin @Tigerblueblood @ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 Red Koi next to Target and Best Buy off of Poplar does it well.  Octopus sashimi
None of my patients are showing up.
@Skalded @mkmcanin @Tigerblueblood @ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 I thought I didn't like octopus, but I just had overcooked octopus before.
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin @Tigerblueblood We thought he was KO'd, but he's getting back up to fight!! 

There is a chance for him yet
@mkmcanin @Tigerblueblood @ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 Indeed, Only seafood I don't like is raw oysters. I like fried and charbroiled NOLA ones.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @mkmcanin You just given me my idea for my last meal.
@Tigerblueblood @ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin @jmj1757 Totally missing out.
@Tigerblueblood @mkmcanin @jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant I think the seafood here is pretty damn good.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @mkmcanin Okay, you're both aliens.
@ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin @Tigerblueblood @jmj1757 What?!!!

What is wrong with you?  Sushi is the best food ever.
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin We should have a party.
@mkmcanin @Tigerblueblood @jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant I know he was talking sea bass though.
@mkmcanin @Tigerblueblood @jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant If it's sushi it doesn't matter. It's all frozen.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @mkmcanin Aidan was talking about going somewhere to eat dolphin. I swear, if I cooked one of you, he'd it it.
@mkmcanin @Skalded @jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant Definitely good stuff, but I prefer the hard to get into hard-shelled type.
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin Crab is the absolute best, though.  I could eat 30 lbs of crab in one sitting.

Clams too.
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin No exceptions for me.  I can't think of a single marine animal I won't eat.
@ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin @jmj1757 You are.
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin Oh, if we're opening this up to shellfish, I'll be here all day.  If it lives in the water, I'll eat it.
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin You're not human.  NO WAY IN HELL.
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin My list:
Red Snapper
Yellowtail
Eel
Trout
Catfish
Smoked salmon
Walleye
Bass
Orange roughy
Tuna
Tilapia
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin Fresh trout is the best food ever.
@jmj1757 @mkmcanin @ReynoldsRant Fish sticks, man.  That just ain't right.
@mkmcanin @jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant RED SNAPPER FTW!!!
@AyeBP @jmj1757 @mkmcanin @ReynoldsRant I'm with Brandon.  Salmon is okay.  But like only if it's the only choice.
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin Okay, I was gonna jump on Melanie for not liking catfish, but what the hell is this list? That's just wrong
I love Tony Allen so much.
@Tigerblueblood I'm fine with my prediction being wrong but official watch party seems to be following with my prediction of closing at home
@dilleweed Just expensive albuterol.  The "less side effects" is just pharm rep talk.  No studies have borne that out.

My albuterol is $50
@dilleweed I've already given myself arrhythmia with my albuterol.  Speaking of which...
@MeghanShelby YES!!
@ReynoldsRant As far as calling a game he's fair. As far as making the game about basketball and not officiating - he's the worst.
#joeyshow
I hope Steph Curry ate Blues City Cafe's crappy catfish.
@heyradar @jensized shaving cream on the hand and tickle his nose.
@TAismyhomeboy @dilleweed creepy cult...
@dilleweed @TAismyhomeboy I love that movie.
It's really hard to talk to patients when one cannot breathe.
@Skalded @mkmcanin I stress ate a McMuffin and Cinnamon melts.
@mkmcanin No, but thank you for the thought.
@3SOB If only...
@mkmcanin But in like the first 25 minutes here this morning I'm hit with two absolutely wonderful pieces of news &lt;sarcasm&gt;
@mkmcanin Like crap.  Aidan was still sleeping when I left (which is unusual) and MeTweet was half dead.  

So, goodish?
I will get through this Monday.  I will get through this Monday.

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

#MemphisVsMonday
@ReynoldsRant Scott Foster needs to be in there, too.
@ReynoldsRant Most definitely.
@ReynoldsRant NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
#MemphisVsErrrbody Including the asshole other physician in this office who just keeps changing her schedule and screwing mine up.
@CBradyMem and you're treating us all to sno-cones?
@BeauregardJones needs acid coating
@_benchristian_ ayyyyyy
@AyeBP @jmj1757 he's sadistic. He also is awesome at Mario Party.
@AyeBP @jmj1757 Aidan is pretty awesome.
@ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin @jmj1757 normally my approach as well, but my immune system requires sleep to function. Stupid sleep.
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin same
@ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin @jmj1757 unfortunately, if I wanna make the game tomorrow I'm gonna need to sleep. Some time this week sounds fun.
@mkmcanin @ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 I'll kill y'all with Wario. Has to happen.
@Skalded @CBradyMem sounds like Qi, then.
@Skalded you're gonna love it.
@ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin @jmj1757 when I'm well, I'm killing you all with Jigglypuff. It makes it more humiliating that way.
@ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin @jmj1757 I just realized I can play Smash Bros with people on Twitter. Why have I not realized this before?
@Skalded @CBradyMem Qi or chakra? This is important.
@mkmcanin @BeauregardJones THAT'S SO AWESOME, MELANIE!
@CBradyMem thanks. Gonna try to get sleep, but it's hard when I keep waking everyone with my asthmatic cough.
@heyradar sadly, it is one of our biggest worries right now.
@mikefromemphis @KateeForbis cold,man. Cold
I'm still sick and I gave to go to work tomorrow. This sucks. MeTweet is dying. Aidan is sick too. Ugh.
@space_baby_ @CBradyMem @heyradar I'm willing to corroborate...
I want this frog!  
@JoshCrewsReally @briantruitt I could only stomach it until the part about them complaining Thor was female. New Yorker should be ashamed...
@KateeForbis but where do we have the parade? Memphis or West Memphis?

Dammit!
@space_baby_ @CBradyMem @heyradar lol
@CBradyMem @space_baby_ @heyradar yup. Undercut. It's back from the 90s like everything else.
@jenxhawkins yeah. Definitely not postpartum. Maybe regular depression? Or drugs?
@jenxhawkins it can last sometimes a few months after, but usually starts within 2 weeks of delivery. I suppose it could be mild at first.
I vote this Cavs/Bulls series be decided by a tiebreaker game of 2-on-2:
Cavs - LeBron &amp; Kevin Love (w/injury) 
Bulls - Rose &amp; injured Rose
Wow
Oooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh
@natediggy75 mother's day brunch.
@jenxhawkins @Skalded your job must really suck
@Skalded chorizo dip tho

Body count. htt…
Two charges on LeBron. I think these refs are getting fired.
That was a painful possession.
@mkmcanin not allowed - we're going to the Finals!
@space_baby_ @mr_gause they're so beautiful. I just wish they were always the color of the first bloom of the year.
@BradPee pics or it didn't happen..
@JessiSheron my family and I loved that movie! I kept thinking about Hamlet throughout, then saw it was directed by Branagh and thought "ah"
@Skalded accurate. Pineapples are good at rebounding
@CCCass23 I would go insane.
@jdylansandifer @CCCass23 lol
@MeTweetForFood @Skalded double jinx
@Skalded why is LeBron Batman?
@mkmcanin @MeTweetForFood he seemed to be "putting the mustard on" looks fine now.
@Skalded I see that
Not a LeBron fan, but I really hope he's not injured badly.
@AyeBP were you arrested or something? That's inhumane
@Skalded @mkmcanin @jdylansandifer 'tis true my green skinned angry friend
@mkmcanin @jdylansandifer Krystal has Icees - Coke, cherry, and blue raspberry
@JoeMullinax yeah, forever...
@KateeForbis @AyeBP Tony Allen
@mkmcanin @tomhaberstroh DUH

@dahlia_thomas @neilhimself @davidlovephotog @ColleenDoran that's pretty damn awesome!
@CBradyMem that's the sweetest!
@mkmcanin okay, since you gave me my sour cream hate, I'll allow the bacon hate. This is a one-time only exemption. Just for you.
@KateeForbis @AyeBP one time (actually a few times) I've sat down in the wrong car. One time I started to drive before realizing.
@AyeBP lol
@tomhaberstroh @KateeForbis Lies, damn lies, and statistics...
This math makes no sense. How are Grizzlies more likely to go to conf finals but less likely to win it all than GSW? 
@mkmcanin @MeTweetForFood he demanded to wear it today.
@BenTBrown @MariottiSports what I really want is Central's ribs with Rendezvous' rub.
@BenTBrown @grizzlam I agree. It is delicious. Great hole in the wall atmosphere too
@ahubes1023 @mikefromemphis @memgrizz @aa000G9 you guys are the coolest family ever!
@space_baby_ I k of you're horrified, but I am laughing so hard. Kids, man. Kids...

@mkmcanin that's a travesty.
@mkmcanin well, that sucks
@Carson_Irwin lol
@jmj1757 is this your greeting to your mother on Mother's Day?
@mkmcanin *your  damn autocorrect
@mkmcanin you're family should definitely adopt me and MeTweet.
@mkmcanin no way in hell. Sorry.
@jmay11 @3SOB @PhotoNikki such a great shot!
@mkmcanin she looks fun!
@mkmcanin same
@badunclep @warriors @memgrizz all I can think of is @MeTweetForFood's joke about this...
Happy Mother's Day, @MeTweetForFood -you're the best mother our little guy could ever hope for!
Happy Mother's Day to all the wonderful mothers out there today. It's an incredibly hard job to do well. 

@MeTweetForFood does it the best!
@AyeBP we're both from tiny rural communities in southern WV.  We have traveled a lot. I like a lot of places. Nowhere is like Memphis.
@AyeBP seriously, Memphis is the absolute best place on earth. I'm in love with this city. Have been since I first visited.
@arubrum @thespacebase you must have reminded him of that possibility...
@jasonrmcintyre you're an idiot.
@KateeForbis @SnottieDrippen @HebertofNH no one likes losing steaks. They're both delicious and expensive...
@Tigerblueblood @mkmcanin Good Answer! Good answer! *Family Feud voice*
@thespacebase that sucks.
@mkmcanin enough for life?
@AyeBP @mkmcanin that's happened to us way too many times in our lives. Just ask @MeTweetForFood
@AyeBP @mkmcanin that's not cool, man
Hater here is just jealous...  
@CBradyMem just take them to an ER. That's like their primary service provided.

Amen, @GDarb65. Asthma is killing me after that game. I think I hit my inhaler 10 times already tonight.
@AngieBritt see, I don't need no skool
@AngieBritt it the end of the year. Screw school!
@littlejondavid sure thing
I'm not saying I'm from the future or anything, but... 
Welcome to the Grindhouse, @warriors 

This is big boy basketball.
Michael Conley Jr. - GROWN-ASS MAN
@Mike12983 MeTweet always gave me hell for it. I just never cared for him.
@Mike12983 I booed Mo when he was here.
Mud too thick to splash
@jmj1757 commercials are time to tweet Vines of Conley's awesomeness
@jmj1757 we can discuss later. Grizzlies ball I'd happening right now.
@SainAsylum just retweeted it from @World_Wide_Wob
This crowd is awesome!!
Y'all, I love Memphis soooooo much!
Live look at @AyeBP 
Guys, I have groupies! Some lady in the section beside us came to my seat to tell me her family loves to hear me yell at everyone!
I'm way too... what's the word? TURNT UP! 

Yeah, that's the word.
@space_baby_ @jdylansandifer well I'm self-medicating my cough, then.
@mkmcanin twitterlesschad would be the best Twitter handle of all time.
@space_baby_ @jdylansandifer does that mean I won't be? Don't kill my buzz man.
@jdylansandifer me too
Do we have the best NBA team in the association or what? 

@memgrizz 
@mkmcanin thank you so much. He's super excited about it! You did an amazing job on it!
Thanks to @mkmcanin Aidan is styling in the best mask in the forum! 
@MamaHellCat @mr_gause my bad.
@TAismyhomeboy that's pretty awesome actually
@mylifeisdelish these are great thoughts
@xSerrinx pulp, but really only like it if fresh squeezed.
@mr_gause what about 99 Ways to Leave Your Lover? That seems right up your alley...
@SainAsylum @MeTweetForFood @Mike12983 yeah, people be crazy
@notthefakeRed @mkmcanin well, I meant her brother, but I'm not overly fond of Kanye, no.
@MeTweetForFood @Mike12983 yeah, I laughed a lot at us being called a power couple...
@mkmcanin don't tell me you like him, too...
@mkmcanin Yay!
@GibsonsDonuts 
@pennjillette @straczynski @neilhimself @arfisk @MrTeller So you're the the traveler? I'm so confused...
@Beware_Cyclops I didn't even think of that! I'm an idiot!
@straczynski @neilhimself @arfisk @pennjillette @MrTeller this is all deflection. One of you is a time traveler!
@KateeForbis @AyeBP yeah that is why I don't buy if I don't have cash to tip with.
@KateeForbis @AyeBP I just tip with cash, but it does suck because I won't get a drink if I don't have cash.
@Mike12983 hilarious
@Mike12983 I have not...
@Mike12983 maybe this? 
@Mike12983 let's not be silly
@Mike12983 I love it so much.
@Mike12983 yeah. It was funny.
@Mike12983 lol
@Mike12983 lol
Spotify was like "Hey, you like weird music.  Here are 30 weird songs in a playlist." 
Tonight may be my favorite night on Twitter ever.
@KateeForbis @AyeBP it was wonderful
@KateeForbis @AyeBP  Bartender at last game made my Makers Mark and Coke with a 4:1 ratio of bourbon to soda.
@straczynski @neilhimself @arfisk @pennjillette @MrTeller This is proof that time travel occurred. An idea from nowhere.
@Mike12983 you may be onto something.
@Mike12983 duh
@NickPitarra @TommyFPatterson I'll take it...
@Mike12983 regular unicorns?
@TommyFPatterson @NickPitarra not sure alpha male is how I'd describe this....
My Twitter timeline &gt;&gt;&gt; all things*. 

*except unicorns because they kick ass.
@NickPitarra @TommyFPatterson lol
@NickPitarra @TommyFPatterson the only loser in this series is the game of basketball. So many fouls.
I Mutumboed that little MFer though.
Okay, I'm not overly easy to scare and I'm cool with spiders but one just descended right in front of may face illuminated by my Nook. Ahhh!
@AyeBP @Skalded awesome!
@Skalded goodnight
@AyeBP @Skalded yeah. Lol
@MeghanShelby @Skalded @missbekah Growing up with 80s slashers as my lifeblood, the Scream movies are a great.
@AyeBP @Skalded all of his cartoons are hilarious.
@AyeBP @Skalded I have lots of problems with the chart overall, but the grapefruit thing makes it.
@AyeBP @Skalded Grapefruit is the worst 
This new "Discover Weekly" thing on @Spotify is creepy good at picking new stuff for me to listen to.
@missbekah @MeghanShelby @Skalded you ever watched Black Roses? So bad it's good.
@MeghanShelby @Skalded @missbekah you should totally make "shut named meg" your handle

*ducks for cover and blames Skalded*
@MeghanShelby @Skalded @missbekah lol
@Skalded @MeghanShelby @missbekah exactly! Gruesome, but with humor (intentional and not so much intentional) to offset
@missbekah Kevin Williamson is just a fun creator of stuff.
@MeghanShelby @Skalded @missbekah I don't like that kind of movie at all. Gruesome just for shock value. At least old slashers had humor.
@Skalded @missbekah please don't. She is scarred for life. In her defense, her imagination is worse than any horror movie.
@heyradar @mkmcanin I think I've solved this riddle, Nick. ;) 
@missbekah last scary movie I watched in theatre was Blair Witch. MeTweet didn't sleep for weeks, so she won't watch scary movies anymore.
@missbekah lol
@missbekah old wing of the Catholic hospital that used to be the asylum. I was the only one in that entire creepy area. Scared. To. Death.
@missbekah definitely. I watched The Ring for the first time in med school. I was on call sleeping in hospital. The call room was in the
@mkmcanin I am apparently really good at math in my sleep. Had to set it to 2 digit multi operation math or I'd just shut it off w/o waking.
@mkmcanin I don't really wake up so well. I need it to be annoying. I actually have an alarm app that makes me do math problems to snooze.
@mkmcanin mine was a rooster crowing for a while.
@mr_gause should we gird our loins?
ER visit in your future...  
@missbekah I saw them all on Netflix, completely in the dark, alone. I was terrified.
I'm pretty sure if you rewind that shot of CP3 ESPN cut to, you could see him mouth "Austin f**king Rivers?"
@missbekah I will! I like being really scared. Adrenaline rush. 

I know they're poorly received but I love the Paranormal Activity movies.
@AngieBritt well if that don't make you cry like a baby...
@jdylansandifer you should watch Into the Woods
@missbekah @mylifeisdelish @space_baby_ I have 30 minutes of The Babadook left. (Aidan woke up. ) Great movie!
I'm calling it now:

Game 4 HOU/LAC - "The Big Baby Game" complete with chant and standing ovation. .
This Austin Rivers thing would be like Thabeet getting a standing ovation in FedEx Forum.
I thought I couldn't hate the Clippers more, but... 

BALLMER!
I figure in 10-15 years we'll be hearing about a common ass injury in NBA players due to the flopping. 

Probably called Clippers buttocks.
@MeTweetForFood @AngieBritt @maggieb94 there was a whole movie, I'm sure you find a different Bashful gif... Geez.
@SainAsylum @BeauregardJones @AyeBP @mikefromemphis @Tacomeat901_7 "Sean, I just saluted..."
@MeTweetForFood @maggieb94 nope. I did much better than you.
@Tigerblueblood @CBradyMem that is an agressive looking corn dog...
@maggieb94 @MeTweetForFood we're both very good marriers
So Griffin flopped on a Harden drive (in which Harden also flopped).

How soon will the tear in reality reach Memphis?
You don't need a res-

Don't do this
"They were …
@mkmcanin lol
@mkmcanin alright...
@jmj1757 @AyeBP I just don't understand what the NBA expects the defenders to do. Are they supposed to dodge the shooter when they do that?
@jmj1757 @AyeBP indeed I did. I like you for some weird reason, though.
@mkmcanin what about that bearded guy with boobs in the corner? Might be a girl...
@jmj1757 @AyeBP puts up tons of ridiculous shots that have no chance of going in (Durant too) just to get fouls. Defender is just standing
@AyeBP @jmj1757 Harden is on another level with it. It's just not fun to watch in the least.
@jmj1757 @AyeBP if you watch over the past few years, he and Durant both seem to have worked more on drawing fouls than improving game.
@jmj1757 @AyeBP it's a dirty way to win and I wish the NBA would stop it. It's the primary reason I hate Chris Paul.
@AyeBP @jmj1757 yup.
@jmj1757 @AyeBP this year has been bad for Grizz flopping. I absolutely hate it. Who likes watching free throws?
@jmj1757 @AyeBP and I HATE it! I hate when Marc flops too. 

I think the jumping into defender wild shot to draw foul play is destroying BB
@jmj1757 @AyeBP so, you like them hypothetically?
@jmj1757 but it's Chris Paul...
@SainAsylum indeed
TRUTH  
@AyeBP 64
@AyeBP that's covered in "I like basketball".   There is none of that occurring. It's all fouls, all night.
"Austin" "Rivers" is "upset" 

#addquotesforhumor
Anyone watching this HOU - LAC series should join me in a support group of people who hate themselves.

Oooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh!
Mark Jackson may legimately be the dumbest human being on the planet.

@xSerrinx those are my favorite - seriously
I see everyone pity favoriting that last tweet...
When you tweet something that gets no response at all, it's like: 
@AyeBP that's... Interesting
@RayBanActual I said "what the hell?!" out loud when he said that.
.@NBAOfficial was obviously given this note from the league prior to this game. 
@CBradyMem @SainAsylum Trademark applications are handled by @mylifeisdelish

@BeauregardJones me too
@natediggy75 @notthefakeRed @CCCass23 I gotta try it.
Proposal for NBA playoff officiating:

Fouls only called when blood is drawn or bones broken.
@mkmcanin I'm jealous of people with nice families
@AyeBP anybody saying that. Cause Calkins went nuts and is gonna kill you if he's in a mask.
@AyeBP famous last words
@MeghanShelby @mylifeisdelish it's the best thing ever
@MeghanShelby agreed
@MeghanShelby lol
@mistressmousey you have a fun office
@MamaHellCat @AyeBP commas. I need commas, but Twitter hates me.

@ChloeDenDen I weep for your country.
@Tigerblueblood I'm not showing you my boobies...
@stjepansejic you're the absolute best. I'll pass this along to everyone I know and convince them to pay for it as well.
@notthefakeRed @CBradyMem unless the best thing to remember that you're thinking about has to do with sex, I'm not sure I agree.
@CBradyMem that's the best thing to remember.

@mkmcanin @MeTweetForFood That is so freaking awesome! Thank you so much. He'll love it.
@sneakybison England seems be trying to become way to much like the US. I was hoping we would become more like England. :(
@heyradar here's one of my sister... 
@mylifeisdelish @Skalded still laughing at this.
@mylifeisdelish @Skalded LOL
@mylifeisdelish I'm gonna call your bluff and check with the trademark and patent office.
@GrizzlyTigerD @Skalded @jenxhawkins @MeTweetForFood This conversation offends me.

@heyradar Alright, if you need closure, the answer is "magnets"
@heyradar @RockWigsnatch There are no original ideas. The art is in the telling.  And we all know who told it better.
@heyradar "weird science shit" wasn't sufficient?
@CBradyMem I've decided I have to have McEwens now.  I'm crashing this birthday dinner.
@CBradyMem I won't be there, sadly. I meant I'm also jealous of your future self.

@AyeBP this is hilarious. You just broke like 5 or six anal people with this one picture. Lol
@mkmcanin @HydeParkSwag from what I understand, GoT has plenty of trouser snakes as well.
LOL

I guess Mr. Moore is a little sensitive... 

This is seriously cracking me up. 
@mikefromemphis Queen song juxtaposed against famous stock photos caused chills. Damn that marketing team.
@jenxhawkins @mr_gause @KateeForbis @Skalded @GrizzlyTigerD this is the weirdest exchange I've ever seen.

<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>Lionel Messi makes Jerome Boateng fall on face vs. 'Pitbull/Ke$ha- Timber' Music Remix<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>


@ZacharyBD when I first saw it I thought he got away with a foul. But the baseline angle shows it is completely clean.
@Schweinehaus What about the other way around?
Golden State has never been in the Grindhouse for a playoff game. They will not be prepared for fans to get up in their heads.
The fun part about this "in Golden State's head" thing is that Kerr and team will make adjustments for Tony and Mike and such, but...
@jenxhawkins I haven't even tried the muting part yet...
@jenxhawkins I like TweetDeck
@KateeForbis Meh.  They're essentially the same as music/movie critics.  So who the hell cares what they say?
@RayBanActual same
@ReynoldsRant @arubrum @jmj1757 You say "unbiased person" like that's a real thing that exists.
@CBradyMem I'm now laughing while thinking about people twerking in front of their bosses while at work.
@CBradyMem @jmj1757 @arubrum That's how you raise children!
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @arubrum Damn it!  I may need to be added to the list now.
@jmj1757 @arubrum Wait, @ReynoldsRant didn't give you the memo about the meeting?

We may have to have another meeting about Austin now.
@jmj1757 @arubrum I didn't want to tell you this, but you're on the kill list.  We'll make it peaceful.  You were a cool guy.
@jmj1757 @arubrum Rules are rules man. Start making exceptions and the next thing you know we're plunged into anarchy.
@jmj1757 @arubrum Respectfully disagree.
@dilleweed awwwwww
@_benchristian_ Bjork is awesome!
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @TAismyhomeboy So I had like 4 or 5 100 level classes at the end.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @TAismyhomeboy The last two semesters were awesome because I put off the Social Science required elective stuff.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @TAismyhomeboy Most of my classes were biology (even most of the electives) which I love, so it wasn't bad.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @TAismyhomeboy I pretty much carried 18 every semester.  I think my last two were just 15 which was great.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @TAismyhomeboy My second semester freshman year was 21 hours.  Never again. That sucked.
@MagicJohnson @PetePranica Ummm..  They would have to get past the Grizzlies to accomplish that...
@missbekah EVEN BETTER!
@missbekah Birthday cake, tho.
My 4yo son watching Snow White:
"She has an apple, and it's poisonous. This is a murder. Tell me when it's over, mama!"

LOL
@CBradyMem @MeTweetForFood It really is her spirit animal
@mkmcanin Or any kind of cake really.
@space_baby_ You're good.  Spiders aren't that bad.
@Skalded East of West is the best book on the stands.  So awesome. You should pick up the first trade.
@Skalded If you have a tablet, it's well worth the annual subscription.
@Grizzfanatic23 @eperry328 @ChrisVernonShow So great.
@Skalded He's the best.  Do you read Manhattan Projects or East of West?
@Skalded I'm subscribing to it, but after that, I'm going all digital with Marvel Unlimited.  It's a 6mo delay, but it's so awesome.
@Skalded Do you follow Hickman?  He tweeted this morning that his proposed title for Secret Wars #1 was "Perfect Jumping Off Point"
@Skalded I'm excited about Secret Wars, sadly.
I can drink again tomorrow!!!
Any advice, @mistressmousey? 
@MeghanShelby Yes.  What was his deal?
Geez, this guy is an idiot on the radio right now.
@KateeForbis don't let the terrorists win!

1. Conley: 26.4
2. Harden: 26.2
3. Griffin: 26.1
4. Paul: 25.8
5. Curry: 25.4

(Via @RealGM)
@jmj1757 @mkmcanin @arubrum I'm not technically a tweet stealer although @MeTweetForFood says I am. I can't help having psychic abilities.
@Tigerblueblood @natediggy75 @MeTweetForFood Just get one of everything.  That would be like $15 tops.
@natediggy75 @MeTweetForFood DO EEEET!!
@space_baby_ @CBradyMem Unstoppable.

Well, unless someone lures Carol away with pronto pups.
Best thing about Mike Conley was this post-game quote:

"I felt like I was a liability"

That's not humble or modest. That needs a new word.

team all defense?

I was outvoted.
@Jabowilson At least he'll have a Finals MVP trophy.
@ReynoldsRant and I'm sure he's loving it.
@ReynoldsRant OMNIPRESENT TONY ALLEN
@TAismyhomeboy @jmj1757 Definitely.  College was the best.
@TAismyhomeboy @jmj1757 This is true.
@mkmcanin I'm sure he would.
.@jmj1757 is currently in an exam.  Let's hope that Grizz win didn't ruin his chances of becoming a professional housesitter.
@CBradyMem We need to get @AyeBP and @mikefromemphis to drop some beats and lyrics about this.
I really just want to greet every patient today by yelling "FIRST TEAM ALL-DEFENSE!" and a high-five.

Not sure how well that will go over.
@Skalded Machines don't get sore.
@courtneygodbey The first Digimon movie was awesome.
@bellmemphis @929espn @JohnMartin929 F*** the FCC
@Skalded I will serve my robot overlords diligently.
@929espn is fun this morning. @JohnMartin929 

I kinda wish the entire 2hrs was just the unedited audio feed from Tony Allen
@waspinatorrulez @_benchristian_ there is no proof that he didn't...
@MrsHirez I really liked what I've seen so far. Hopefully I'll finish it tonight.
That time of night when I just creep through people's timelines and favorite random crap, probably freaking them out.
@mkmcanin @FaulknerMemphis I already predicted such on April 30th - GET ON MY LEVEL!
@jmj1757 periscope it
@jmj1757 you should just write "FIRST TEAM ALL DEFENSE" on your paper then walk out.
YOU CAN DO EET! YOU CAN DO EET ALL NIGHT LONG!  
Must. Go. To. Goonies. Anniversary. Celebration.  
@heyradar @ChrisVernonShow Uh-oh Nick from the Internet sighting. Never sleeping.
Well, Twitter has slowed to a crawl. Time to eat something and finish The Babadook
@GrizzBongoLady @ReynoldsRant @AaronSaidWhat she'll turn soon enough.
@Skalded @GrizzBongoLady @HPbasketball not possible.
@GrizzBongoLady @HPbasketball why does anyone follow him?
@moJO_SHabby you can count on me!
@3SOB @jmay11 @natediggy75 I also have to set two separate alarms!
@ReynoldsRant I'm keeping this Tweet forever and when you have children I'm gonna show it to them as the reason they exist.
I think we've met the future Mrs. Reynolds  
@arubrum @KateeForbis I won't even remember to express my thoughts to him as he walks out 10 feet from me. 
@mikefromemphis @KateeForbis @HPbasketball yes it is.
@Partylikker @World_Wide_Wob yes!
If y'all aren't following @World_Wide_Wob, you aren't an NBA fan.
@jmj1757 @arubrum @sbnGrizzlies that's smart.
@RockWigsnatch with a trophy of course.
@jmj1757 @arubrum @sbnGrizzlies what?! I thought you were a professional housesitter.
I'm pretty sure Steph played so bad tonight because he was terrified of Conley's toughness.
@FlyerGrizBlog @Scarlet_Tartan @RossWooden @memgrizz MUD
Preach!  
@HydeParkSwag @RayBanActual @ACBarron12 @Skalded I like that.
@ACBarron12 @RayBanActual @Skalded Marc is Groot. CLee is Starlord
@RockWigsnatch I have a joke, but I prolly better not go there.
"I'm just saying that so I don't get fined" 
@Skalded @ACBarron12 I was just joking. Falcon is awesome. So is Vince.
@ACBarron12 @Skalded I love Vince. I just wanted to make the joke.
@RayBanActual @Skalded @ACBarron12 I like that.
@ACBarron12 @Skalded yeah, that works. Falcon is pretty lame.
@Skalded definitely! He's definitely the Hulk
I can pee now!
@MeTweetForFood @warriorsworld @KingShake96 @jmj1757 YES!
@RockWigsnatch technically it was 22
Alright guys. Hear me out. 

Mike Conley = The Vision 

Tony Allen = Scarlet Witch 

Guys?

GUYS!
@MeTweetForFood lol
I'm just really worried that after we win the title it will be taken away on account of Mike Conley being an actual machine.

Mike Conley Jr.'s Oracular Spectacular

I love…
I'm just gonna leave this here... 


@ReynoldsRant yeah. I yelled at those jerks. I hate that. Also, how you gonna leave a Grizzlies game early?
@FaulknerMemphis they've definitely not paid attention to the Grizzlies.
LOL  
AIRBAAAALLLL
Let's just pray Nick steals the ball on every Golden State inbound
Mr. Michael "MFing Broken Face MVP Who? Clutch" Conley Jr.
@ReynoldsRant No, Luke! Give into the anger
I'VE HAD TO PEE FOR 30 MINUTES!
Grizzlies Twitter &gt;&gt;&gt; all other Twitter 
#firstteamalldefense
@Skalded our "shooter"
Refs definitely trying their best to keep Golden State in this game
@ReynoldsRant Tony Allen omnipresence.
@natediggy75 nope. That's on you, dawg. You were praising the enemy.
@natediggy75 nope. Not happening. I've always hated him. This season was the first time I didn't loathe him entirely.
Not luck. Tony is now everywhere at once. You just can't see him. He's like God.  
You mean like a pre-pubescent dick grafted directly onto an asshole with hemorrhoids?

If so, I agree.  
SNAP INTO A SLIM JIM!
Tony has achieved omnipresence
I love Tony Allen. 

Even those stank ass TNT announcers have to say he's amazing.
@Skalded best coach ever

I just threw up in my mouth
@ReynoldsRant your journey to the Dark Side is nearly complete.
HOW ABOUT LIKE A TYE DYE CHICKEN WHO SCREAMS ACTUAL WORDS AT YOU
@mr_gause I now think of you laughing your ass off every time I see that commercial.
@ReynoldsRant that would be the very definition of EPIC
Told you.  
@notthefakeRed Corona *barfs*
@MrChuck_901 only half? You're doing Twitter wrong.
@MeghanShelby damn straight!
@MeghanShelby lol
You know the TNT guys are like "shit, we don't have any talking points for Memphis crushing Golden State"
@SheaLivesOn @natediggy75 Memphis would definitely benefit if fights were allowed like in Hockey.
NBA, on behalf of Mike Conley who is too much of a gentleman to say so: FUCK YOU AND YOUR MVP. 

WARRIORS GO NO FURTHER
@arubrum Fuck the bay area
These friggin TNT announcers need a cold shower after ever single Golden State field goal.
Fuck you, @NBAOfficial
Remember when y'all said "I can't hate the Warriors." 
Eject his ass!
@notthefakeRed @mkmcanin can't Retweet!
@ReynoldsRant Zbo and Tony should rush the basket any time he gets wide open.
@CBradyMem @moJO_SHabby the face isn't getting reinjured. It's titanium now.
@mkmcanin for the other team
@missbekah he needs Flonase.
That's right, Marc! Make Spits pay for that flop.
@cbateshardy you beat me to it.
@mkmcanin YES!
@MeTweetForFood @ReynoldsRant Tag team, baby!
@ReynoldsRant #TWSS
@Ashbomb84 wrong series. Your talking about HOU - LAC
#TWSS  
@KateeForbis I hate national announcers sooo bad
Zbo don't need your whistle! Zbo gets the ball in the old fashioned way.
"The winded Mike Conley" Fuck you @NBAonTNT
"Strength in Numbers" = "Refs wit us"
Kick his ass out!
That's right. Our guards play better after head injuries.
Umm. Steph just threw the ball in to himself
What is "serious surgery"?
@AyeBP agreed
Screw you, Shaq.
Charles Barkley is hilarious. "You can't beat people up anymore. I hate that. We got that girly basketball now."
This guy has got it together!  
@jmj1757 Amen!
@maggieb94 @Carson_Irwin @jensized @BradPee I seriously considered it. I'm weird like that.
@ReynoldsRant 
@jenxhawkins sorry.
@JessiSheron lol.
@JessiSheron just think of all the bills you can pay with exposure.
@BeauregardJones okay. That one's pretty good.
@MeTweetForFood @ReynoldsRant 
This is very funny because it is true. RT: @MeTweetForFood "#SeniorYearIn5Words Sorry, I did not attend."
@courtneylee @CurryForMVP @NBA best conversation on Twitter.
@FaulknerMemphis that's how you know she's the one. Well, after she tells you because she already knows.
@mkmcanin it was a good run Miss Felony, but I hate sour cream. 

*awaits block/unfollow
@jenxhawkins @mr_gause I do have a cat, though that is mostly dog. Dumb, clumsy as hell, acts just like a dog.
@jenxhawkins @mr_gause I'm a cat person. I like all animals, but love cats the most. 99% are douches, though.
@FaulknerMemphis @MeTweetForFood she doesn't like California, so...
@jenxhawkins @mr_gause most cats are douches
@KateeForbis I call that "the MeTweet".
@KateeForbis just keep skipping back and writing down the words you could pick out in a spiral notebook
@AveryCloseCall @WB_Games Cinnamon Toast Crunch destroys all other cereals.
@courtneygodbey That's awesome!
@mkmcanin @BeauregardJones It's just business.  Sorry.
@AyeBP @jenxhawkins Damn it!  Rules are hard.
@mkmcanin @BeauregardJones Too late.  I'll have it on a shirt and popular before you get the paperwork signed.
@viggysaysrelax I subtweeted you.  Better?
People who want to be subtweeted... What's up with that?
@mkmcanin @BeauregardJones I'm making that shirt right after the "IDIOTS FIND A WAY" shirts are printed.
@jenxhawkins @pmg38104 @AyeBP @dilleweed @ViewFromBoxSeat @Skalded These are things he needs to know.
@JessiSheron Neil Gaiman retweeted my question to him one time when I first joined Twitter. That was not fun but really cool simultaneously.
@AyeBP @heyradar @dilleweed @Skalded You're gonna get a furry or a costume?
@AyeBP creamslush blue coconut.
@AyeBP @heyradar @dilleweed @Skalded I read through a conversation on Twitter that was CRA-ZY. College prof. taught his class in his costume
Of course, Ladies' Nights would be a disaster.
I've decided I'm printing shirts with the following:

IDIOTS FIND A WAY
@FaulknerMemphis This was my conclusion.  We'd figure a way to discriminate.  

Idiots find a way.
@themikenorton You're the best, Mike.  Now, if you could just find another show to livetweet, please.
But then I realized people would just be jerks about what you chose to be.
"You idiot!  Why did you change into a woman TODAY of all days?!"
I was thinking the other day that we wouldn't have all the problems of sexism if we could change sex at will like some species of frogs...
@MeTweetForFood @ReynoldsRant Sorry.  I'll stop tweeting you.  Geez.
@jmj1757 You should make business cards and get a 92.9 commercial.
@jmj1757 I wouldn't be afraid you would steal anything from me.  I doubt you'd break anything. Born for it.
@jmj1757 I feel you were born for this role.
@dilleweed @Skalded @TAismyhomeboy @AyeBP @mkmcanin nobody likes parasites.
@Skalded @TAismyhomeboy @AyeBP @dilleweed @mkmcanin same
@AyeBP @TAismyhomeboy @dilleweed @Skalded @mkmcanin That's actually what causes most bladder infections... But usually no poo in pee.
@AyeBP @Partylikker @ReynoldsRant LOL
@Partylikker @ReynoldsRant The first time I ate Gus's, I was like, "this is the best thing I've ever put in my mouth"

....

wait for it...
@Skalded @mkmcanin Not to burst anyone's bubble, but everything has poo on and in it.
@ReynoldsRant Monsters.
@MeTweetForFood @heyradar "A black sheriff?!"

"Hey, it worked in Blazing Saddles, didn't it?"
Re: my last tweet about Monty Python/Mel Brooks collaboration.

Looks like humanity survived a near miss.


@MeTweetForFood @heyradar "I'm getting really pissed off!"
"If I was that close to a horse's wiener, I'd be worried about getting pissed on"
So, obviously there was never a Monty Python/Mel Brooks collaboration because the entire world would literally die laughing.
@heyradar @MeTweetForFood I'm glad we're here too!
Please tell me this means my dream of an H2G2/Marvel crossover is coming true!

*awaits Mos Def casting announcement 
@heyradar @MeTweetForFood "Did you say, 'Abe Lincoln'?"
@moJO_SHabby LOL

Definitely sit Green.
Show of hands: who would not be surprised if during the game tonight Tony literally split in two to guard both Steph &amp; Klay simultaneously?
@Skalded @moJO_SHabby That is a sure sign of a great conversationalist.
@siggeplump @autogatos @shoomlah Same request here.
@Skalded that is true of every job, unfortunately.
@shadowsip Yup.
@shadowsip Free biscuit taco, tho.
@_benchristian_ @CBradyMem No. I'm not saying that.  They don't all become jerks.  There are even some teenagers that are sweet.
@mylifeisdelish @CBradyMem Always breaking the mold...
@CBradyMem They don't all turn horrible.  It's just I've met very few jerks that are less than 8yr old.  A few for sure, but not many.
@natediggy75 We'll hopefully make it there this weekend.
@heyradar @skalded @jenxhawkins @moJO_SHabby So, why do adults want them to be jerks?
@badunclep Definitely.
Teenagers are like 97% jerks: 3% nice.  That's peak jerkiness.  It plateaus until the late 20s, then rises ever so slightly.
100% of babies are awesome. As they get older, the percentage drops slowly until about 8 years old. Then the percentages drop precipitously.
Children are the best people.  What happens to them that turns them into horrible, awful adults?
@sneakybison That's terrifying.  It's like you looked into a dark and twisted mirror.
@moJO_SHabby @space_baby_ Damn it!
@space_baby_ Me too
@bellmemphis @_benchristian_ @heyradar "terrific" as in "causing terror"?  You monster!
@JeSuisDawn @mr_gause I want to favorite this, but I'm too scared.
@CBradyMem that is usually the correct answer for most of life's questions.
@MeTweetForFood @space_baby_ @heyradar the guy or the beard?
@MeTweetForFood @space_baby_ I'm pretty sure @heyradar is represented there as well.
@moJO_SHabby @Partylikker @GrizzlyTigerD @dilleweed @thespacebase SHUT UP! I'M NOT AN IDIOT.!
Uh-oh. That's dangerously close to the horse gun tweet...  
@Partylikker @GrizzlyTigerD @moJO_SHabby @dilleweed @thespacebase I do not lead by example to my patients. Not in the least.
@GrizzlyTigerD @moJO_SHabby @Partylikker @dilleweed @thespacebase I can drink mill with anything. I actually could drink whipping cream...
@space_baby_ what a stupid tweet.  :P
@ACBarron12 @notthefakeRed @Partylikker I gotta say, if I dropped a cookie in a bathroom I'd be faced with a very difficult decision indeed.
@ACBarron12 @notthefakeRed @Partylikker are you going to rub it on the toilet?
@space_baby_ I was honestly confused at first because I was like, "you know, that guy we all follow"
@space_baby_ I'm only mildly joking. A little while ago I referenced a tweet from last night from a person like everyone was involved.
@space_baby_ there are cliques? I just assumed everyone on my timeline loves everyone else on my timeline.
@notthefakeRed @mkmcanin 
@notthefakeRed @mkmcanin I understand this as much as Jonah understands paper maps.
@mkmcanin I don't even understand the concept of Facebook games

#starwarsday #maythe4th #jedi #stitch #sta… ht…
@missbekah I had someone yell across the Atlanta airport at me when we were flying one time. MeTweet was like, "WTH, dude?"
@jenxhawkins those never looked pleasant.


@notthefakeRed that's screwed up, man
@AyeBP love that show
@Skalded @MeTweetForFood So, is MeTweet Wolverine?  I can see that.
People on the whole are really not that nice to their own children.
@MeTweetForFood @Skalded Yes
@Skalded @MeTweetForFood Intelligent.
@MeTweetForFood You ARE right.
@MeTweetForFood This seems like a time-delayed tweet attached to the wrong tweet...
@moJO_SHabby Get on my level.
@MeTweetForFood I'm sorry but in my weakened condition...
@moJO_SHabby Dude, that was sooooo 6 hours ago.  Get with the times.
@Skalded Definitely wanted more Vision
I'm experiencing the miracle of the loaves and fishes, only it's patients and maladies and it's not a good thing at all.
@jenxhawkins @MeTweetForFood You are correct.
@MeTweetForFood Whedon is overanalyzing his own film?  I'm febrile here.  Work with me.
@Skalded @MeTweetForFood I do think they missed an opportunity there.
@MeTweetForFood What's wrong with Age of Ultron?
@MeTweetForFood Star Wars?
Today needs to end.  It took me about 5 minutes to figure out how to spell possess. I even Googled and got it wrong.
@dallowspicer @ValiantPodcast @Whospaul @MikeMyersBrunch @Valiant_Central Ugh.
@space_baby_ @_benchristian_ @heyradar ALWAYS GO MINT JULEP!
@BeauregardJones Same here.
I give that beard less than 6 months before it is sentient. 
@ReynoldsRant @MeTweetForFood I don't understand fingernail clippers.  That's what teeth are for.
@MeTweetForFood @Skalded Sorry.  Don't throw them away, please.
@Skalded Looks good.
@MeTweetForFood @Skalded I have never moved anything in my home.  Proof: comic books on the table where you said not to leave them.
I'm pretty sure you're just a bot at this point. 
@ChrisVernonShow @929espn @geoff_calkins I usually tune in every day.
I'm pretty close to going FULL MONDAY.
@RaganSmash Definitely hopeful that Hasseltine can lift my mood.  Sad thing is I was still optimistic about Grizzlies.
@ChrisVernonShow @929espn @geoff_calkins Ordinarily listen while at work after lunch to get a boost.
@ChrisVernonShow @929espn @geoff_calkins You may have been optimistic at some other point, but what I heard wasn't fun.
@ChrisVernonShow @929espn @geoff_calkins Listened for a few minutes this morning before turning off. Took 5 minutes to turn you off.
@mistressmousey Awesome.
@RaganSmash @929espn @geoff_calkins @ChrisVernonShow Horrible.
I was mistaken. This sign should be hanging up to the @929espn entrance today. @geoff_calkins @ChrisVernonShow 
@mkmcanin acoustic
@mkmcanin Creep
@bullshaith @topcowmatt I also abhor dick-assery in atheists who think they're too smart for everyone else.

#starwarsday #maythe4th #yoda #padme #starwars #maythe4th #maythefourthbe… ht…
@topcowmatt as a faith-based believer in a deity, I also abhor radicalism in all religions.
@topcowmatt I believe in free speech, but intentionally offending people is a dick move. Couldn't get behind the #JeSuisCharlie movement.
@Skalded I would have if not for Twitter.
@topcowmatt boggles the mind
@tankboy925 I did in my mind...
@tankboy925 summons in video games are pretty cool. Brings in mythical creatures to fight for you. That's all I got.
@tankboy925 lawyers frown on mine
@Skalded @dilleweed I seriously consider becoming vigilante every single day.
@tankboy925 Irish coffee fixes both problems
@thespacebase @mkmcanin @KateeForbis my statement stands. Regina Spektor writes all of her music especially for me. That makes her the GOAT.
@dilleweed @Skalded definitely. Woman who literally starved special needs child for over a year still has him. Smdh
@dilleweed we have an LPN and an MA
@BenTBrown That show was great.
@dilleweed LOL.  I totally feel for my nurse.  It's the other doctor's fault.
@dilleweed I don't get the religion argument.  Haitians can't do human sacrifice because it's unethical.
@dilleweed So we're not staffed for her added volume today.  My nurse is running behind as a result.
@dilleweed I've had 4 no shows so far.  Part of my bad Monday is the other doctor is here (usually not on Mondays)
@stardustgirl Thanks!
@dilleweed Not TennCare.  Love my tax dollars going toward a barbaric, archaic procedure performed on non-consenting helpless babies.
@dilleweed Female genital cutting is illegal in US.  Penile foreskin and clitoral hood removal are analogous procedures.
@dilleweed Thing is, it's already illegal if you take into account the constitution says you cannot apply laws differently based on sex.
@dilleweed And Muslims, and African tribal cutlures, and rednecks.
@dilleweed I wish it would be made illegal like female circumcision is.
@mylifeisdelish @dilleweed Agreed.
@dilleweed @mylifeisdelish I send about 3-4 boys to urologist every year for this problem.
@dilleweed @mylifeisdelish If not lubricated, the circular wound tries to heal over completely, just like a circular wound on the arm would.
@dilleweed @mylifeisdelish Circ is two healing wounds that come into contact. In addition, the wound to the foreskin is circular.
As if Monday was already bad enough, I'm sick.  Runny nose, sore throat from hell, and cough with fever.
@MrChuck_901 Had to shut him off.
I'm pretty sure everywhere had some available for purchase.
Now I have to send a baby to surgery whose urethra is closing up due to the mother "running out" of Vaseline for circumcision wound.
My favorite reason for not trying to breastfeed (also most common reason):

"I smoke"

Did you smoke while the baby shared a blood supply?
@baddeacon @StarWars @ToppsDigital The beard game is strong in this one...
@ReynoldsRant When you stop enjoying them, you are dead inside.
Me: are you breastfeeding?
Mother: no
Me: any reason why you don't want to BF?
Mother: I eat spicy foods

facepalm

Screw off, Monday.
@JoeMullinax @3SOB What an ass.
I don't understand nationalism.  It's a fucking country.  It's made up. It's pretend.  There are no lines with names on the Earth.
The other doctor in my office (who is not supposed to be here on Mondays) comes into my office to tell me all about the boxing match IDGAF
@AngieBritt Poor little guy.
@CBradyMem Friday, tho
@BenTBrown @3SOB @mkmcanin I'm pretty sure the character in High Fidelity is Lloyd Dobbler all growed up.
@BradPee @CBradyMem That one should automatically add an emoji like #StarWarsDay does
Well, just when you thought Monday couldn't suck anymore...
@jenxhawkins there are meds that make stupid people tolerable? Sign me up!
@mkmcanin @thespacebase @KateeForbis best part of the soundtrack is Regina Spektor. She's the best ever.
@mkmcanin 
@BeauregardJones you should have joined us on Twitter where we learned that @jmj1757 has not held or used an actual map.
@warrensimons @dinesh_s @manafmk @ValiantComics all or nothing...
@BeauregardJones at least it wasn't a 9:30 game

May the interaction which tends to change the motion of an obj…
@dilleweed @TAismyhomeboy you probably just broke 10 guys with the second condition.
@mkmcanin Grosse Pointe Blank is an overlooked classic.
@mkmcanin that movie was surprisingly awesome. 1408 was pretty good, if we're going dark.
@LordDunlow Netflix
Guess everyone went sleep. Comics or Netflix?
How does one choose a favorite John Cusack movie? That's like picking a favorite child...
I really liked the show Sliders.
This is much more fun than when I waxed poetic to no one at all on Twitter about Dadaist painting.
@mkmcanin @space_baby_ @KateeForbis love those movies.
@mkmcanin @space_baby_ @KateeForbis I hadn't watched those movies in over 15 years and I watched a documentary that rekindled that obsession
Companies try to act like piracy is new and a result of digital availability. I was responsible for hooking up two VCRs every time we rented
I chase my 4yo around the house while making the ch-ch-ch-ch ha-ha-ha-ha Friday the 13th sounds. That's weird right?
@space_baby_ @KateeForbis one, two Freddy's coming for you...
I watched most of Nightmare on Elm Street movies as they came out (starting with #3).  I was 6 when it came out. WTH is wrong w/my parents?
80s Madonna&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other Madonnas
@ZaQ5322 @KateeForbis I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not...
@KateeForbis lol
@KateeForbis I usually check Twitter at this time and it's dead. Everyone local asleep and the UK just waking up. Like Christmas tonight.
@mkmcanin I was obsessed. It is still an affliction.
We all wonder this as well.  
@KateeForbis @mkmcanin sleeping not allowed. Sorry.
Spent lots of time and money in the 90s hooking my computer to my TV to watch them on the TV. It took 20 years to catch up to my hopes.
I remember Video CD before DVD came out. I was so excited. I also remember downloading little clips and trailer in QuickTime format.
Listening to Spotify 80s radio for like the past 3 hours. Haven't skipped a single song.
I imagine what I'm experiencing right now is what someone born in the Civil War felt in the 30s.
Fuck.  
@jmj1757 my first computer had no hard drive at all. Everything was stored in its 256k of memory. Had to load a program from floppies.
@mkmcanin @jmj1757 those sucked. GPS is much better.
@jmj1757 I want to arrange a 14.4k baud recreation for you. I remember when mp3s were invented. The first one I downloaded took 3 hours.
@jmj1757 What's that like?
@mkmcanin @thespacebase @KateeForbis @jdison92 I love that scene and that movie.
So, @jmj1757 you make me feel old. Can you remember "before Internet"?
Fun Dunlow fact: I won Best Solo in marching band competition one time for playing My Heart Will Go On on the alto saxophone.
@mkmcanin it just removes it. Sometimes I want to search for the word with something else and it won't let me.
There are so many people awake! This is fun. Where are you guys usually?
@mkmcanin  I plan to watch it.
@KateeForbis I remember it took hours to download the trailers. Thank God for high speed Internet.
@mkmcanin I haven't. Actually the list of movies I haven't watched is huge.
@KateeForbis but when it came out, so many stupid people loved it (including my sister) that I decided to pass.
@KateeForbis the funny thing about Titanic is I'm a huuuge James Cameron fan and I was watching movie trailers online before it released.
I have no wont to do so, either.
I've never watched Titanic or any of the American Pie movies.
@jmj1757 @TAismyhomeboy Anything goes? More like everything sucks
@TAismyhomeboy I grew up in WV.  Had enough country music for 3 lifetimes. Only Patsy Cline, Hank Williams Sr.,and Willie Nelson get a pass.
@TAismyhomeboy you're welcome
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant Just watch anything. Google Dead parrot.
@jmj1757 @mkmcanin @ReynoldsRant I would spend my entire life in college if they would pay me my current salary. I even loved my classes
@thespacebase @mkmcanin @KateeForbis @jdison92 Not a single song that wasn't awesome
@thespacebase @mkmcanin @KateeForbis @jdison92 we shuffled the entire Queen discography on the way to Nashville one day.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 you guys need to fix that ASAP
@space_baby_ so salty.
@mkmcanin indeed!
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant I hate him as well. I liked that In Time movie, though
@space_baby_ ugh. He needs to stop that.
@mkmcanin @jmj1757 SO DID I!
@jmj1757 @TAismyhomeboy I'm coming over to rip your arms off now.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 Nsync ruined music. For about a decade.
@mkmcanin @jmj1757 my constant rotation was Batman, TMNT tour soundtrack, Weird Al greatest hits, and Robin Hood soundtrack
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 now Backstreet Boys. They suck.  Hard-core. Nsync too. And any other boy band from the late 90s/2000s
@jmj1757 only thing I can figure.
@space_baby_ same here. I hate Mondays
@jmj1757 It was the worst medium for music. Vinyl and 8 tracks were better. No idea how they took over.
@Skalded agreed
I also realized there were several songs I didn't know. Since I only owned the album on cassette, that means I was really awesome at FF/RWD
I really did listen to the Prince Batman soundtrack when mowing. It was awesome.
@KateeForbis I was unaware of this. I love Weezer.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @mkmcanin if "Dad rock" is 70s rock, I'm gonna beat you to death with Jonah's severed arms.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @mkmcanin my tastes really don't change. I just add more stuff.
@mr_gause thanks!
@mkmcanin @ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 this is very true. I'm not even sure why.
@ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin @jmj1757 DMs
@ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin @jmj1757 I'm just sliding into your DBS, but in public
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin my shame knows no bounds
@mkmcanin @jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant I like what I like. I like a lot of crap.
@mr_gause when I'm on call for the hospital I can't drink at all because I could be called for emergencies at any time. 10 days every month.
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin damn you, Jonah. I agree.
@ReynoldsRant @mkmcanin @jmj1757 definitely.
@mr_gause I feel ya. I can't drink until the 7th.  Last drink was Thursday night.
@mkmcanin @ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 cosign
@jmj1757 @mkmcanin @ReynoldsRant I think you just sent an angel crashing straight to hell.
@jmj1757 @mkmcanin @ReynoldsRant this hurts me. Please tell me you like Queen. I don't think I can converse with someone who doesn't.
@mkmcanin @ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 yes, but still a rabbit hole
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @mkmcanin don't send me down the rabbit hole too!
@jmj1757 @mkmcanin @ReynoldsRant there isn't much in the way of music that I don't like. Little Wayne is one of them.
@mkmcanin @ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 we can exchange friendship bracelets!
@jmj1757 @mkmcanin @ReynoldsRant I don't know. It just feels wrong.
@mkmcanin @ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 Beyonce sucks. Destiny's Child is alright. But if we're going girl R&amp;B/pop groups, I choose TLC
@jmj1757 @mkmcanin @ReynoldsRant Katy Perry and Rihanna are both awesome. (and this must be true because I hate agreeing with you.)
@CBradyMem damn straight.
@jmj1757 @MeTweetForFood @AyeBP as the good Lord intended
@MeTweetForFood @jmj1757 @AyeBP would you like pics of that, Jonah?
@jmj1757 @MeTweetForFood @AyeBP I can balance a chair on my chin.
@CBradyMem it makes me think you're going to hunt Paul Newman with dogs.
@dilleweed oh yeah. Alcohol knocks my ass out. I'd drink a lot more if I didn't hate sleeping. Boats make me sleepy too.
@dilleweed I'm constitutionally incapable of napping.
@dilleweed I just don't sleep if I have to get up earlier than 5. I function much better that way.
@notthefakeRed @mkmcanin lol
@mkmcanin you're pretty harsh on babies and toddlers, huh?
@BradPee 
@MeTweetForFood well, I'm in the office approximately 4 days a week. I'm the hospital's bitch for 240 hours each month in addition to that.
@JessiSheron I can do stick figures. I'm grateful for artists and other creatives.
@CBradyMem I think I like your son.
@BradPee @jenxhawkins those extra hours only suck when we have weekday Grizz games
@jenxhawkins @BradPee 4 tens is the bomb. I lobbied for 3 twelves.
Done mowing. Prince really had a thing for this soda: 
Now I mow grass while listening to Prince's Batman soundtrack.
@mkmcanin Houston
@mkmcanin that comes after the Feast of Texans
It's alright, GrizzNation
This just goes as I predicted:

Mike will be back. They will have to come to the Grindhouse. Let's post these in there for the Warriors: 
Called Curry a dick in front of Aidan, but saved it last minute by changing to "Dirk" as I spoke it. 

#DadoftheYear
@GrizzBongoLady ref, tho
@3Shadesofblue my tweet is incoming.
Joerger, I think it's time to open that box that Russ Smith is locked in: 
Some defense would be appreciated
@BradPee @MeTweetForFood cut out my tongue. Difficult decision for her to make, but ultimately she was right.
I'm optimistic. If we have 6 turnovers and they're shooting 65% but are only leading by 7, I think we just need to make a few adjustments.
@MeTweetForFood she even muted me irl
@FaulknerMemphis my beard is more grey than brown now. I'm about 25% grey on my head.
@FaulknerMemphis "first grey hairs" STFU
@mkmcanin Bobo
@BenTBrown @ReynoldsRant well played
@AyeBP yessir
@dilleweed @notthefakeRed not pointy enough
For some reason I have the 1989 Batman soundtrack stuck in my head. I think that means we're winning it all.
@MeTweetForFood this may be your best work ever.
@Skalded the big guy was the reigning champ. Said afterward that he'd never seen anyone that strong in his life.
@Skalded that could only happen with someone that strong, though. Normal person would just pull a muscle or something.
@Skalded it was the little guy's first competition.
@ReynoldsRant @RotowireATC @HPbasketball but your cerebral functions filter them out.
@ReynoldsRant @RotowireATC @HPbasketball it's the same as when you block out extraneous background noises. You still get the impulses...
@ReynoldsRant @RotowireATC @HPbasketball one can literally decide consciously to ignore the pain responses.
@ReynoldsRant Pain is quite literally in the mind. Pain is a higher neurologic interpretation of simple aversive neuronal impulses.
@BenTBrown MUCH EXCITE!
@ReynoldsRant @RotowireATC @HPbasketball pain is literally in the mind. He's all fixed up by the surgery so, it's just a matter of pain.
@ReynoldsRant I'm going in expecting a loss. That way, when we crush them it will be more fun.
Conley should grab the PA announcer's mic and yell "call me Left Eye Conley, 'cause I is right!" 

*obviously followed by literal mic drop.
@FaulknerMemphis All your base are belong to playoff Vince.
Everyone is predicting GSW to win, just like everyone expected the guy on the right to win this arm wrestling match: 
@BeauregardJones @_YoMek @warriorsworld so is Drayvon Jan?
@CCCass23 it's sickening.
@CCCass23 didn't you know it's perfectly acceptable to beat women?
@CCCass23 hater...
@mr_gause Grizz comfort zone
@JessiSheron you are literally the only person on my TL not tweeting about boxing. Thank you.
We interrupt tweeting about the situation in Baltimore to watch two guys beat the shit out of each other. 

#logicalconsistency
When does Drago "break" someone?  Where's Apollo?
@MeTweetForFood you the GOAT
My retweets keep getting favorited by people who don't follow me. I got Twitter stalkers. Much excite.
@jmj1757 @MeTweetForFood @ReynoldsRant I would not trust someone who did not.
2) Chris Paul 
@badunclep @RayBanActual fire the shot clock manufacturer.
@badunclep @RayBanActual fire everyone
@MeTweetForFood @ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 OOOOHHHH!
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant there were jokes about getting yelled at by a date at a losing Celtics home game.
@benschwartzy @KateeForbis maybe because in movies it's a fantasy, while real boxing is two dudes just beating the shit outta each other.
@jmj1757 please no game 7 for Grizz.
@JohnMartin929 @mikefromemphis smile
This is the part where Pop makes me cry.
@Valtinen @neilhimself that's awesome.
@natediggy75 @brandondevin that will be the worst series in the history of basketball.
Somehow, KD's mom is to blame for this.
Perfect tweet 
Yes!  
It's funny when it's not happening to us. #flopping
I don't even really care who wins and this game is giving me heartburn.
So. Many. Lead. Changes.
LOL @Grizzfanatic23 and I wished for triple OT at the exact same moment! 
Currently rooting for triple OT
@FaulknerMemphis lol

TWENTY. FIVE. LEAD. CHANGES.
@notthefakeRed @RockWigsnatch @TAismyhomeboy @jenxhawkins one time we watched 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, then just watched last 30min of 6.
@TAismyhomeboy @notthefakeRed @jenxhawkins @RockWigsnatch but then I get depressed after 3 and have to finish with 4, 5, 6 to get redemption
@TAismyhomeboy @notthefakeRed @jenxhawkins @RockWigsnatch I always start with 4 then watch in chronologically order of release...
@jmj1757 I'll agree with you there.
"Sometimes"  
Please disregard my previous tweet about Chris Paul. I'm suffering a viral illness and I am febrile and delusional.
@Skalded you're right. I don't know what got into me.
@space_baby_ you live in Memphis. What need have you of a humidifier. 80% too dry for you?
I might forgive CP3 for all previous punk-assery after that shot.
HOLY SHIT!
@natediggy75 @BenTBrown @ReynoldsRant never had one of my own, but played many and often at friends' houses.
@BenTBrown @natediggy75 @ReynoldsRant ps4 is close second. Never could stand the 360 controllers.
@ReynoldsRant @BenTBrown honestly never used Diddy or played with anyone who did. What was his deal?
@natediggy75 @BenTBrown @ReynoldsRant best controller is hands down the PS3 dualshock
@BenTBrown @ReynoldsRant Jigglypuff still kicks ass in the new one. They just nerfed him (her?) a little bit.
@BenTBrown @ReynoldsRant sounds like someone is still salty they got their ass kicked by Jigglypuff many years ago.
@ReynoldsRant the shortage made no sense. They made TONS of Gamecube controllers. What did they think people were going to do with them?
@natediggy75 COMMAS HAVE A PURPOSE!
@ReynoldsRant I've been waiting over a month to get one for the retail price
Twitter's 140 character limit makes me use less commas than I'm comfortable with using.
@ReynoldsRant I like the Pro controller but I need that big central A button. Just doesn't feel right. I spent lots of time on GC Smash Bros
@kyrstinavello hopefully you have some comics on your phone or something...
Now, I can play some REAL Smash Bros 
@kyrstinavello you should just bring up embarrassing moments for everyone.
I've just decided I can't root for the Clippers. Rockets/Clippers series would be the ultimate Flopathon. Each game would set records for FT
@TheMadChiclo still pretty stupid in my opinion.
@brandondevin boxing is just as dumb as beating one's wife.
I can't root for Clippers. It just won't take. I know it's best if they win, but I still cheer if Griffin is blocked or they brick a three.
"Guy beating wife is bad" - agreed. 

"Guy beating another guy for money for the entertainment of the world is good" - WTF?
You've not lived until you've belted out Take On Me at the top of your lungs along with your 4yr old while driving to buy comic books.
@Skalded early game, so plenty of time after.
@Skalded well that's unfortunate
@Skalded actually didn't watch because Netflix was down :(
@fastbreakbreak @Ashbomb84 don't knock it til you try it.
@CBradyMem oh, I'm totally laughing.
@CBradyMem not laughing not laughing not laughing
@Ashbomb84 it's bourbon and sugar and mint. What's not to like?
@Ashbomb84 but mint juleps tho
Okay. Gonna watch The Babadook now.
@CCCass23 @Partylikker @dilleweed gave ketamine to 5yr old for sedation and he saw purple dragons and freaked the hell out for over an hour.
If Marvel makes (Hank Pym-less) Ant-man good then they should just print their own money as it would be the most valuable currency on earth.
@dilleweed @ReynoldsRant seems like some really misplaced priorities.
Age of Ultron was awesome. Although X-Men Quicksilver was much better. Scarlet Witch was pretty awesome, though.
@ReynoldsRant I know, but that's not normal position for ribs. No way they could breathe. So horrible.
Look at the ribs! How the hell did they breathe?  
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @arubrum and now I feel really sad for that hypothetical guy. His date probably yelled at him.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @arubrum wow
@ReynoldsRant @arubrum Conley flew with the team. I'm optimistic that he'll play in game 2.
@ReynoldsRant @arubrum we'll see.  I still say Grizz in 6. We split first two and they win game 5 on their floor. We close at home.
@arubrum @ReynoldsRant Saying the Pelicans will win the title is crazy. Saying Memphis will win may be unlikely, but not crazy.
@space_baby_ @mkmcanin you should go live where I grew up.
@JessiSheron good luck!
@tattoosandbones physics.
I usually think advertising in general is crap, and I hate the promoted tweets but damn if Woodford Reserve isn't making me want mint juleps
@Partylikker you're clearly broken. @Skalded will be showing up shortly for your reconditioning.
@space_baby_ @mkmcanin @hollyrwhit I think they've done a great job now and in the past. Of course, my taste in music is suspect.
@mistressmousey well, that was fun. Thanks for sharing. 

"My anus is bleeding"
@ReynoldsRant that is what I was thinking. I fell asleep during that game because I was sick that night. Memory fuzzy.
@ReynoldsRant oh. I thought we were. My mistake.
@ReynoldsRant we are one of their 2 home losses, though. So, there's that.
@maggieb94 @ReynoldsRant I have a love/hate relationship w/ them. There is nothing more exciting but you never want to be in that situation.
@ReynoldsRant of course a game 7 would be a pretty fun, brutal game to watch.
@ReynoldsRant I think we take them in six. I tweeted such yesterday. I definitely don't want to think about a game 7.
@dilleweed @_benchristian_ facepalm
@NickPitarra @robbiez @lanzajr26 alright. Now we know where Nick draws the line. Sex with his grandma
@jenxhawkins @TAismyhomeboy @jmj1757 smdh
@moJO_SHabby @AngieBritt little does, but I gotta say that one was new
@jmj1757 sadly, that was sorta the argument she was making. She didn't go as far as saying we should do meth, but otherwise...
@_benchristian_ that sounds sexual
@jmj1757 obviously
@AngieBritt seriously, how are there people that dumb?
@MichaelSacal agreed. 100%
Woman in hair salon:
"They did a study that shows sugar destroys more brain cells than meth. So meth is actually better for you."

No.
@MichaelSacal that would be epic.
1. make bad decisions.
2. keep doing that.
3. everyone is dead.
@ReynoldsRant I just figured I ticked you off.
@jmj1757 I find them comforting.
@mylifeisdelish @CCCass23 @AyeBP @ACBarron12 you're the best. You say the things that I want to say but are frowned upon.
This is my kind of art. 
@arubrum @ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @AndrewFord22 He's magically and ageless.  DUH
@AyeBP @space_baby_ You're clearly a Highlander.
This complicates matters somewhat... 
@Skalded I've been very upfront on all electronic formats about where my allegiance lies.  The robots will have a digital trail of it.
What if 
@MeTweetForFood Alright.  I got 46.  Which is much younger than I feel.
@Skalded @MeTweetForFood same here.
@MeTweetForFood WHAT?!!!  Mind. Blown.
@MeTweetForFood I haven't done it yet.  I can't find any pictures of myself.
@jmj1757 At this rate, you'll be dead by nightfall.
@jmj1757 haha  You're old.
@CCCass23 More idiots in Franklin.
@mistressmousey Yeah.  That never ends well.  *sending good thoughts*
@mistressmousey I think all of the above is probably the most appropriate course of action.
@BradPee Insurance would only pay for pap smear on one of the cervices, though.
@BradPee She wouldn't get pregnant, so that was their birth control method.
@BradPee I just searched.  I didn't.  It was wild. She only had one functioning uterus, though. Her husband learned that if he used one side
@BradPee Didn't I tell the story of the woman with didelphys when I was in med school?  I could have sworn I did.
@KateeForbis Try it without the glasses.  I've seen other pictures with glasses get put at high ages as well.
If I was the guy in charge of counting Steph Curry 3s, I'd just tweet while he shot and then make up a high number. 
@mr_gause We broke the "We Don't Bluff" curse, so I don't see why not...
@jenxhawkins @heyradar He said "dead on"...
I'm pretty sure this is Mario. 
@robertvenditti @TheMadChiclo Noooooooooooo!!!

I mean...  It's vegetarian BBQ. (yeah.  vegetarian. not meat at all.)
@CBradyMem I"m pretty sure it would tell my I'm 73.
@Partylikker @space_baby_ Pick a bar with a dart board.  Family fun night!
Yes, please!

This AR horror game looks like the future of fear and 'nope'  
So, what's the consensus on spelling of "errbody".  2 "r's or 3?

What does the Commercial appeal say? We'll add an "r" to whatever they say
@dgvick @KateeForbis @arubrum That one definitely needs to happen.
@mr_gause @jenxhawkins Jen, you really should consider his affliction.  He's a Grizzlies, Cavs, AND Browns fan.
@missbekah @natediggy75 @mr_gause @WRIGHT3OUS Probably autocorrects at this point.
@arubrum @KateeForbis The blue ones are pretty cool.  I'm down for it.  Whatever color, I suggest "SMASH &gt; SPLASH"
@space_baby_ I just get in arguments with strangers in real life.
@space_baby_ Sad life.
@KateeForbis @memgrizz Landing gear housing. Dress warmly.
@dgvick He did that kind of stuff in every game we played them.
@jdylansandifer TRUTH.

So, 
1. Be excellent to each other
and
2. PARTY ON, DUDES!
Not to be misconstrued as meaning anything violent, sexual, or otherwise offensive. 
My prediction for MEM/GSW:
Grizzlies in 6.
Game 1 L
Game 2 W
Games 3&amp;4 W
Game 5 L
Game 6 closeout at home

Then we feast on Texans.
@MeTweetForFood we crammed it in each other's faces.
@moJO_SHabby I've obviously blocked that part out.  I don't think she came back.  Not sure.
@badunclep Not worth the effort.  She'll likely OD any day.  It's a miracle she's still alive.
But, happy ending: We live happily 500 miles away from that idiot baby factory drug-addict piece of crap.
Just walks right out in a big scene.  Pastor dumbfounded. Me and MeTweet showing the greatest amount of restraint anyone has ever shown.
You guessed it!  My asshole of a sister.  She stops the ceremony, makes a big scene about how she's coughing (she wasn't) and needs a drink.
Who should happen to walk out of the sidelines of bridesmaids to approach the pastor and start talking to him in the middle of the ceremony?
So, we get to the wedding day.  We're happy.  Everything's coming up roses.  We're in the middle of the ceremony.  The pastor is talking...
So, I think, "let's be nice and hope for the best. She can be in the wedding as a bridesmaid. It makes the number even."
So, Catch-22: if we exclude her from the wedding she'll likely crash the wedding and make a scene. But if we include her she'll do the same.
We are totally consumed in the planning about one thing - my sister.  She's an idiot narcissistic jerk who likes to make things bad for all
So, me and @MeTweetForFood are getting married.  We're happy, we love each other, we pretty much have to fund the entire thing ourselves.
Now, I'm thinking about weddings, so it's time for another installment of what a horrible person my sister is...
@MamaChockley @CBradyMem This is how it's done.
@CBradyMem If it's not your wedding, you get your butt in the Grindhouse.
@jmj1757 Beats me.  I'm just hoping is goes crazy from 3 or something.
@jmj1757 Defense.
@thespacebase @heyradar @mylifeisdelish @TAismyhomeboy Holy crap! You are twins!
That apostrophe is a representation of my current mental state. 
@badunclep You don't have to teach that hate.  It is inherent to human beings.
@heyradar @thespacebase @mylifeisdelish @TAismyhomeboy Maybe your'e twins separated at birth.
I don't follow @HPbasketball but this is the perfect time for my MEM/GSW preview (we're the little guy on the left): 
@badunclep Cosign
@heyradar @space_baby_ I would have started overexaggerating and making myself cough.  Even add a gag and spit every few minutes.
@heyradar @space_baby_ Rude
@TAismyhomeboy @thespacebase @mylifeisdelish I'm somewhere around there.  At this point, it takes to long to calculate so I just say I'm old
@CBradyMem @mylifeisdelish If you google it, it describes a fruit filled pastry, but in Memphis its a sausage and cheese filled pastry.
@AyeBP I knew you'd be interested.
Speaking of dadbod - last RT
@CBradyMem @mylifeisdelish Wish I had a chicken biscuit. Or a kolache.  Or anything to eat really.
@thespacebase @TAismyhomeboy @mylifeisdelish Just read about this. As always, I've been ahead of the curve for over a decade.
@FoxxyShyD Now that we won?  Yes!

"I'll never let go". Lies.
@jenxhawkins the struggle is real.
@badunclep @ZachLowe_NBA I like mauling. The Grizzlies are good at it.
@moJO_SHabby @notthefakeRed sitting is hard
@GailSimone did we do away with Speculative Fiction?
@maggieb94 strong work!
@KateeForbis it's great. It needs to end, though. You know, in order to have an end.
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant @brownasthenight Kanye sucks.
@aa000G9 this may be the best analogy ever.
@maggieb94 @MeTweetForFood awkward....
@MeTweetForFood ooh yeah!
@SiliconPM @warriorsworld I don't know. Is there a devil emoji?
@SiliconPM @warriorsworld wrong part of the state.
@arubrum probably.
@SiliconPM @warriorsworld wrong part of the country I'm afraid.
@arubrum I'm pretty sure that account is a random character generator.
I think this implying something offensive - can someone fire this guy?  
@warriorsworld @3SOB Memphis is Rock and Roll and Jazz.
Bring me Curry's head a platter!
Beale Street is too good for you. Enjoy your summer.  
Blazers are the trick. Grizzlies are the ones doing the whooping. WE. DON'T. BLUFF.  
@bellmemphis you don't understand. No one can shoot threes consistently in Memphis. Sign him and he would become immediate slaw.
Yes! Complaining via wife! That's marriage at work!  
@jmj1757 you're muted too. Sorry.
They definitely need to make an exception for this game and reopen liquor sales in the 4th
@ReynoldsRant I'm muting you until we win.
@CHold I'm booing you.
If that was a flagrant foul, the NBA should be letting my 4yo son play.
We suggest he watch round 2 from his couch.  
Or what I call awesome.  
@MeTweetForFood @BenTBrown but the dog tho, right?
@mr_gause @TheRealTopGun dislocated shoulder - he'll likely never shoot the same again.
Is it weird that I like this marionette act?
My phone autocorrects "Leonard" to "Lemon"
He's devouring the soul of Meyers Leonard.  
@ReynoldsRant just sayin'
@ReynoldsRant it looked intentional to me.
@TBlackford3 nothing unreasonable about that. He merely realizes the horror that is an ant.
You seriously think the refs need to call more fouls for the Blazers?  
@maggieb94 I got this.
@Tigerblueblood @BenTBrown only less bloody... Hopefully
Because he'll break your face if he feels like it.  
That's called "throwing a game". Even the NBA said they threw the last game.  
@BeauregardJones this is a bar? WTH?
@TAismyhomeboy @dilleweed @jmj1757 same here
Boohoo. McCollum broke Mike Conley's face and didn't get anything.  
@jmj1757 chopsticks were invented 3000 years ago
@FaulknerMemphis @ReynoldsRant lamestream media bias in Google searches
@dilleweed @jmj1757 @TAismyhomeboy I just don't sleep.
@Justin_Jordan he really does...
@JessiSheron your Twitter is very fun from an outside perspective, in case you were wondering. My favorite was your fight with your parrot.
@BeauregardJones yessir
@BeauregardJones I look forward to watching you get more and more drunk as you tweet tonight.
@TheMadChiclo indeed it could. Possibly @robertvenditti ?

<FIRE>
<FIRE>
<FIRE>
@BenTBrown @THR I gave up on SyFy doing anything right and stopped watching them after they canceled Stargate
@TAismyhomeboy it was. It got in ma belly!
Now I'm eating BBQ nachos.
@badunclep I didn't need any of that hippy crap to reach that conclusion.
@lcharbonnet I believe it is called a mac and cheese BBQ brisket cone.
@BenTBrown I'm washing it down with bourbon.
@BenTBrown it's very tasty
Yum. This thing is really good. Not deep-fried Twinkie good, but pretty darn awesome. 
I suggest @NickPitarra take over the social media duties for the Houston Rockets. Then, people would learn the true meaning of offensive.
@RaganSmash YES!
Every single person on the planet would have an immediate identity crisis and I would laugh so hard
Sometimes I wish God would open the sky up, tell a really off-color joke, and then just go back to the business of being a deity.
@MeghanShelby @Carson_Irwin they really are.
@CCCass23 what you missed is that apparently the horse is a metaphor for a vagina and the gun is a penis. Do I have to explain everything?
@mkmcanin one of each?
@Skalded @Partylikker @ACBarron12 @MeghanShelby lol  seriously, where are the horse activists. Their hurt is being overshadowed.
Apropos to the whole horse emoji joke firing due to people not getting a joke, I started following @YesThatsTheJoke this morning.
I was mistaken: it's offensive to tell a joke that people are too stupid to understand.  This world is getting dumber by the day.
@PhotoNikki 0-2
@MeghanShelby @Partylikker someone joked about popping packing bubbles yesterday. If that upset a vet, should they be fired?
@MeghanShelby @Partylikker But people with PTSD associate lots of stuff to their trauma.  This is crazy.
@MeghanShelby @Partylikker But this is really why?  People can interpret anything in any way.   This is even more stupid than I realized.
@Partylikker What?
@mkmcanin @missbekah Oh good.  Someone else went there.  Now I can #TWSS the tweet.
@mkmcanin chins are important in holding your throat open.
@mkmcanin That acronym makes me think of bad things.  Not the Beale Street Music Fest.
Of course this is in New Orleans...

@moJO_SHabby @natediggy75 @palmettogal80 I just searched all @memgrizz tweets with "growl towel" in them &amp; only see the Spurs &amp; Thunder ones
So, if I get this straight, it's offensive to joke about shooting an abstract symbol of a sports organization? 

I think we need to chill.
@GrizzBongoLady @MeTweetForFood I used "on fleek" non-ironically with MeTweet one time and her eyeroll would put a 13yr old girl to shame.
@RickTrotter Where I live, it's tested daily at noon.
@chadjshanks @HoustonRockets @CHold Apparently, analogies about horses are a very sensitive topic.
This one is the best: 
@natediggy75 @moJO_SHabby @palmettogal80 Spurs Game 4 sweep.
This is weird... 
@Tigerblueblood @jmj1757 @twittername This is good information.
@KateeForbis If I ever get to be the featured MVP, that will be my "favorite Grizz moment".
@space_baby_ 
@Grizzfanatic23 @MeTweetForFood Carol has it!!!  We're saved!  It actually says "We Don't Bluh"
@MeTweetForFood This is not good.
@TAismyhomeboy @maggieb94 @jmj1757 Definitely.  Natural selection at its best.
@maggieb94 @TAismyhomeboy @jmj1757 They're bigger than God intended.
@TAismyhomeboy @jmj1757 Never saw earwigs until I moved here.  They give me the heeby-jeebies.
@jmj1757 They're arachnids, but more closely related to scorpions than spiders
@jmj1757 Daddy long legs are just fun.

Fun fact: they're not actually classified as spiders.
@jmj1757 LOL  I leave spiders alone - they kill the others.  I also try to catch moths and release them.

All others meet a swift death.
Serious question for any vegans on my TL:
How do you handle bugs/vermin in your house?

Not trying to attack anyone, I'm just curious.
@Partylikker @jenxhawkins @MeTweetForFood @heyradar @MeghanShelby @Bret_Weaver Good times.
@MemphoNewsLady "unless his body rejects them"
@jenxhawkins @MeTweetForFood @heyradar @MeghanShelby @Bret_Weaver  I was called a "sad woman" by her friend.
@jenxhawkins @MeTweetForFood @heyradar @MeghanShelby @Bret_Weaver  Strong work.  I had an argument with her friend and got blocked by both
@mkmcanin It's horrible.  I don't know why I couldn't stop watching.
@mkmcanin I'm scarred forever. That was gruesome
@mkmcanin I tried to find of video of him, but  could not. I did come across this, so I'm forcing you to watch. 
@mkmcanin Every time you say that I think about Magnus Ver Magnusson screaming "TOR!!!"  when he won World's Strongest man.
@mkmcanin I'm sure no one will miss them.
Nothing speaks more about the concerns of our society when a 4yo has not had shots since 6mo but they've been to the dentist religiously.
@jenxhawkins Nobody wants to have to play this game tonight.
@RockWigsnatch @GrizzlyTigerD Niiice.
No. 
@jenxhawkins @chellebell101 I don't understand people.  Why is the inclination to be a dick? That's the opposite of what you should be.
@maggieb94 Possibly.  Better set your DVR, just to be safe.
@jenxhawkins @chellebell101 Where did you see these people that are rude and stupid?
@jenxhawkins @chellebell101 Correct response is to move away from them and not answer phone calls or accept them as guests in your home.
@moJO_SHabby @maggieb94 I'll be wearing my Spider-man mask, so I'm good.
@maggieb94 I'm sure you can watch it on TNT tonight.  They'll probably show me being carted out.
@cra @CanRevAgency That's hilarious.  Well... not for you of course.
Ken Mauer - I'll definitely be getting kicked out of the Forum tonight. 
(made with @HandfaceVideo for @huffpostukcom)
ht…
.@CHold lets see if you can manage to say something nice about the city of Memphis tonight.
@MeTweetForFood @KateeForbis yup. Even I passed out
@mkmcanin mine just has one item: Be Awesome 

I'm killing that one every day.
@KateeForbis @PetePranica My son loves when they hit him with a blow dart.
@heyradar my mom would work in something racist about Asians.
@jenxhawkins @lcharbonnet "I keep getting older... They stay the same age..."
@lcharbonnet @jenxhawkins great movies.
@BeauregardJones @KateeForbis I would love a down vote on Twitter
@CBradyMem :(
Steve Blake has drawn 95 fouls in his career. 21,000+ min.
Conley drew 95 this year. 2300 minutes…
@themikenorton ugh. Corporations are the worst.
Who created Caitlin Snow on #TheFlash? According to @DCComics, nobody - Who created Caitlin Snow, the alter... 
@mistressmousey You're going to kill @tattoosandbones 

Those look delicious, though.
@tattoosandbones Weren't they also in The Wizard with Ben Savage?
That bag of Reese's Pieces didn't last nearly as long as that Hershey's Bar last week.  I'm not completely convinced I'm human.
@notthefakeRed What is wrong with people?
@tattoosandbones Where the hell is this?  "Scientists"?  Really?
@Skalded @MrChuck_901 protect the dogs!!!  He'll kill the dogs!!
@BradPee @heyradar @mylifeisdelish YES!!!
@MeTweetForFood @heyradar I just assumed he was that angry.
@MeTweetForFood @TAismyhomeboy @AyeBP "Little Debbie, Little Debbie!"

That's a great song.
@heyradar Snickers do have the highest calorie:dollar ratio, however,  FYI
@mr_gause Dear Lord...
@mr_gause Between Grizzlies and Cavs Twitter, how do you keep your sanity?
@heyradar Murder?  I think that's the appropriate response.
.@WillTheThrillB5 is making me very happy right now.  This is how one acts as a role model. Keep up the good work, Will.
@GailSimone @c2e2 WANT!!!
@tattoosandbones I think @LosFelizDayCare is trolling you about zucchini bread.

28 DAYS!!! Let me check my schedule there, I.T.
@heyradar You're the best. We need video of this.
Oh no! The @space_baby_ affliction is spreading! 
That doesn't mean that we don't have problems with racism, sexism, and other forms of "other"-ism.
We're all just "people".  Anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to make you act in their interest to hate and harm others.
Looking at the world as "my people" and "your people" is what causes all of the problems we have.
@_benchristian_ #3 is the most important in my opinion.  I'll allow lapses in #1 and 2 if #3 is fulfilled.
@dilleweed I do.  All day, every day.  I don't know how you make it through a day now.
@jenxhawkins @DlamarC33 Is this a euphemism or literal animals?
@dilleweed Now I'm going to cry.  And now I want to be home with my wife and son even more.
@dyrbert @thespacebase Yes, please!
@grendeljd LOL
The fundamental problem with society is the tendency to focus on the differences between individuals rather than the similarities.
@brevinknight22 @GrizzBirds @memgrizz @thefishnation this is horrible news.
If I don't go to work do you think anyone would notice?
@mkmcanin it's okay. I accidentally liked a Fergie song the other night.
@CBradyMem no. Eat both
@heyradar so beard oil is a thing? I think if I kept a beard I would need a degreaser judging by my stubble.
@thespacebase facepalm
@TAismyhomeboy @moJO_SHabby I threw a hissy fit about losing
@TAismyhomeboy this is accurate. She only left out Leuer
@Gingerhazing @GailSimone @Jindai @MisfitsTamara also, needs taint webs
@Gingerhazing @GailSimone @Jindai @MisfitsTamara sorta looks like he tried to have sex with a harmonica... We need this book

"Grandma, where were you when [Important News Event] happened?"

*sighs wearily*

"On Twitter, darling. We …
@tattoosandbones trick question - answer is dinolution
@JoshCrewsReally I've never watched Titanic.
@MeTweetForFood @ReynoldsRant the Cheshire Cat said so.
@FoxxyShyD @KateeForbis @CameronSym10 my mindset has us losing this series, so probably not going to be positive tonight. Ask again tomorrow
@FoxxyShyD @KateeForbis @CameronSym10 the numbers aren't good, though.
Grizzlies post-loss Ouroboros is in full effect. Get out while you still can. Look at the other stuff on your TL. 

Race riots -  FUCK.
@mkmcanin that's an unfortunate problem for an ice maker.
@KateeForbis @CameronSym10 Welp, I guess game 6 is a lock.
@RickTrotter did you break Mike's face?

1) Break clutch player's face
2) Chuck up shots.
@jenxhawkins okay, you win.
@jenxhawkins me too!
@ReynoldsRant yes. Only 3 less than Marc and Zbo combined.
@KateeForbis I've already determined we're losing this series, so think what you want. I'm throwing my hissy fit.
He broke Mike Conley's face? I thought that was McCollum.  
“We broke their point guard’s face.” — Damian Lillard

(I …
@ReynoldsRant Grizzlies lose = bad place. Bad place is ultimate pessimism.
@Partylikker already on it
@ReynoldsRant hopefully. I honestly wouldn't be shocked if we dropped the series.
@RaganSmash Leuer is not clever.
@ReynoldsRant I let my guard down and thought I could trust him. I'll be back to booing him at introductions.
Dave Joerger sucks so bad
@jmj1757 I hate Joerger so much
@ReynoldsRant stupid move
Welp, if that wasn't the Grizzliest thing ever.  Also, the Toniest thing.
@KateeForbis not even
@CHold and we know from this series that McCollum is allowed to break Mike Conley's face with no repercussions.

Like when I used to drive into the wall when playing Mario Kart with my l…
LOL 
@RayBanActual @Skalded @KateeForbis I do like Swamp Thing. None of those others though. Just my personal opinion.
@JessiSheron lol
@KateeForbis I did though.
@Skalded @KateeForbis Batman is the only good DC character (especially his rogue gallery)
Jeff Green gives all y'all the middle finger

Now, back to B…
@MeTweetForFood ugh. I can't even...
@BenTBrown nope I already covered this in my last tweet. It's the Idol from Vice Versa. Reinhold/Savage
@AaronABCP I think that's just "not sorry, loser"
FYI: That's Judge Reinhold in Vice Versa, not Asik.
So I just figured out the Grizzlies secret. Dave found this idol and had Mike and Nick hold it at the same time. 
@jmj1757 could offer a tactical advantage
MODA center just cheered for Leonard because they thought he was Bieber.
@RockWigsnatch lol.
What do vegans do about ants?
Tony refuses to pass to Nick.
@mr_gause Evil Grizzlies are my least favorite NBA team.
@KateeForbis definitely
@RockWigsnatch I like that one
@missbekah same here
@theRealHrdlicka no. They misspelled Lemon
Poor Sonic. They obviously figured Durant was going to be in the playoffs.
@BeauregardJones join the club. I screamed my head off at him in our first home game against Blazers this season.
@mkmcanin @missbekah @DTaylorClay the devil
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant that's why we need video.
@jmj1757 Adventures of Cookie and Cream. I want video of you and @ReynoldsRant playing together. Game destroys friendships.
@notthefakeRed @dilleweed @bellmemphis @heyradar @hollyrwhit lol
@dilleweed @bellmemphis @heyradar @hollyrwhit I do speak fluent Valley Girl.
@bellmemphis @dilleweed @heyradar @hollyrwhit I detest red wine. I only like very sweet white wines
@Partylikker it's gruesome
@dilleweed @heyradar @hollyrwhit @bellmemphis funny thing is like cheap tequila the best.
@heyradar @memgrizz @EastMemphisMoms ding ding ding
@BenTBrown I'll let you believe yes.
@MeTweetForFood she really is y'all
@dilleweed @heyradar @hollyrwhit @bellmemphis gin is delicious. favorite liquors: bourbon&gt;tequila&gt;gin&gt;rum Vodka's only purpose is mudslides
@ReynoldsRant I was sick and missed the Golden State game. I need Russ to be unleashed.
@heyradar @memgrizz @EastMemphisMoms best name I've seen "M'aly" 3 guesses what common name it sounds like...
@BenTBrown this is hilarious information.
@Partylikker @BradPee @CBradyMem @heyradar @hollyrwhit @bellmemphis I did not know this...  *goes to buy tonic right now*
@heyradar @hollyrwhit @bellmemphis biggest problem with this whole thing is gin&gt;&gt;&gt;vodka.
@Partylikker @BradPee @CBradyMem @heyradar @hollyrwhit @bellmemphis that's really what it's all about.
Said no one ever.  
@ReynoldsRant more Playoffs!
@MeTweetForFood @jenxhawkins @AngieBritt @bellmemphis @heyradar I'm quite sure Jesus enjoyed a good joke. If not, screw that guy.
@moJO_SHabby that's a tough one.
Patchouli oil with the and 1!
Missed dunks are the most painful thing to watch in basketball.
@mr_gause I try to avoid it as much as possible. I hate that we do this kind of stuff to each other.
@CBradyMem this is why I dislike having to send Aidan to school soon.
@mr_gause I'd prefer nobody attack anybody and we just work together to fix issues. We're all human beings.
It's November 2014,and someone comes from the future and says, "Bulls/Bucks round 1 playoffs - awesome series." 

You laugh at the crazy man
@spaceninja @tattoosandbones LAUGHING. SO. HARD. NOW.
@mkmcanin magnets are simple - magic.
@mychalsmith @jenxhawkins I think military violence is the worst form of violence. Violence is an answer for nothing.
@WyzeChef @jenxhawkins @whit0013 @MrESPN @red3blog also stupid.
@space_baby_ @natediggy75 you have to correct that immediately.
@jameskay113 @UncutBits it's an awful, archaic, barbaric practice
@jenxhawkins that's equally stupid. I believe remarked on that stupidity today before the Baltimore riots even began.
My timeline is getting a little disappointing. Violence is never good. War, riots, murder. Never justifiable. Understanable, but not right.
@tattoosandbones Seriously.  Zucchini bread is one of the greatest things one can eat.
@tattoosandbones zucchini related bread items are usually sweet, so chocolate ones would be awesome.
@BeauregardJones Plus, we'd have to go 7 games to extend the start of round 2 by 2 days, so that wouldn't really help at all.
@Skalded @MeTweetForFood @ilovememphis Indeed.  His maniacal laugh is something to behold.
@heyradar @KateeForbis I'm more a #wherethehelldidtheforkgo?
@sneakybison I was 5 or 6 when I first watched it shortly after it came out on video.
@sneakybison When the movie originally came out in theatres in the US, it started an alarming trend with teens.  LOL  

I love that movie
@Skalded @MeTweetForFood @ilovememphis He wanted to do nothing else afterward.  He's a "crack shot"
@Skalded @MeTweetForFood @ilovememphis When we went to Disney World back in March, we did the Frontierland Shootin' Arcade for the 1st time.
Welp, I know what I'll be doing every weekend with my son. @MeTweetForFood  
@sneakybison Isn't it though?
@BeauregardJones Playoff Vince Carter is real!!! I told you!!!  He's real!!!
@KateeForbis Are there people who don't?
So, I can't see any of the videos because I'm at work, but apparently Baltimore has descended into anarchy. #BaltimoreRiots
Hour one: No pants, this is awesome
Hour three: boy I sure think some weird thoughts 
Hour five: I…
@KateeForbis Hold up.  Gotta actually add something to my bio now (blank since I started Twitter)
@KateeForbis @trueNBAfan @jenxhawkins @pmg38104 @ViewFromBoxSeat End run Full House &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything.  So stupid it came back around to great.
@trueNBAfan @jenxhawkins @KateeForbis It was THE best. Plus and Minus were my favorite characters.
@trueNBAfan @jenxhawkins @KateeForbis These are my favorite shows.  Today's Special and Pinwheel especially
@_benchristian_ @jenxhawkins @KateeForbis Shhh.  Nobody needs to know that it's Canadian.
@jenxhawkins @KateeForbis Best show ever.  I'm pretty sure that's why we're all so cool now.
@Partylikker @BradPee @heyradar I haven't seen it, but from what I hear about it, pretty dead on.
@BradPee @Partylikker @heyradar I grew up in southwest WV right across the river from KY.
@BradPee @Partylikker @heyradar Those idiots are from the panhandle - they're essentially Pennsylvanians.  They even have northern accents.
@BradPee @Partylikker @heyradar Can't wait to take my son camping in Shelby Forest this Spring/Summer. (If it would ever stop raining.)
@BradPee @Partylikker @heyradar It's the only thing I miss about WV. I literally grew up in the woods.
@BradPee @Partylikker @heyradar I knew you were joking.  I just wanted to put out there that I'm really excited.
@jenxhawkins Yup.
@Partylikker @heyradar @BradPee I'm personally very excited.  I like the outdoors and stuff.
@jenxhawkins What?! I was never that stupid about the past. I'm sure I was stupid about lots of things but I wouldn't pretend to know stuff.
@skottieyoung LASERS!!!!
@DrunkOnComics @RyanBrowneArt Is that a badger?


@wootjay This must be so awesome for you!  Can't think of anyone more deserving. You got mad skills.
@RockWigsnatch @heyradar @BradPee Definitely a front for online cocaine.
@RockWigsnatch @heyradar @BradPee Wait, are we talking jeans or cocaine?
Dave Joerger about Russ Smith: "Turn him loose."

YES!!!!

#Russdiculousnessness
@thespacebase damn it! I made it weird!
@thespacebase I'm in your closet...
@mkmcanin TRUTH
(via 
Tapirs are taking over my Timeline - WTH?  
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant I did. I'm very upset.
@jmj1757 @tacobell forget CEO - you have my endorsement for President of the United States.
@RayBanActual that's all CGI - not really a sport at all.
@ReynoldsRant I feel I missed something amazing.
@TAismyhomeboy @heyradar @space_baby_ @dilleweed @MeTweetForFood basically, if there is an ailment, she has endured it. Bad genes, that one.
@TAismyhomeboy @heyradar @space_baby_ @dilleweed @MeTweetForFood had that too.
@heyradar @space_baby_ @dilleweed *actually 2009
@heyradar @space_baby_ @dilleweed this was in 2010 when we had the epidemic.
@dilleweed @heyradar @space_baby_ this was from WV
@heyradar @space_baby_ @dilleweed yup. Got sick on our 10 hour drive to DC. Practically had to carry her to the hotel room.
@space_baby_ @dilleweed hope he feels better. Highest fever I've ever seen personally was actually when MeTweet had swine flu -  107.3F
@ViewFromBoxSeat @space_baby_ I had a patient just the other day that had elevated liver enzymes (early liver failure) from too much Tylenol
@ViewFromBoxSeat @space_baby_ very high risk. If you gave your old Tylenol every 3 hours for 3r hours you'd definitely overdose.
@ViewFromBoxSeat @space_baby_ fever can be a sign of something more dangerous, but fever itself is a good thing. Part of the immune response
@ViewFromBoxSeat @space_baby_ fever is not going to harm a child. No child has ever died from a fever.
@ViewFromBoxSeat @space_baby_ that's dangerous. Tylenol can kill your kid in overdose and that's why you can only give it every 4 hours.
@JessiSheron weight is the last safe place to discriminate. It honestly sickening.
@JessiSheron facepalm
@BeauregardJones in Zbo's defense, Nick is the Calathiest of the Calathes.
@ReynoldsRant @BuzzFeedSports @amadoit holy crap. And they let him continue?
@ReynoldsRant I'm assuming this means worse possible scenario and they have to wait until a surgeon weighs in this morning.
@missbekah went to bed around 530 last night. Spent all day at CMOM and then watched 3 playoff games. Gonna watch TV now.
@arubrum @ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 probably because he reminds him of Judge Reinhold.
@jmj1757 @KateeForbis agreed
@jmj1757 sometimes it needs to be opened up to drain. Also - antibiotics.
@ReynoldsRant. Meta 
@ReynoldsRant I don't understand why they exist. What is their purpose? They don't seem to be advertising anything. What do they do?
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 for me personally Westbrook represents every jerk I've dealt with that was "good at stuff", but also a total prick.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 wrestling? Westbrook/CP3 hate? Or both?
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @FaulknerMemphis I loved old school wrestling when I was a kid. Current stuff I hate.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @FaulknerMemphis he's fun to hate. He's a heel. Just like in wrestling.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @FaulknerMemphis it's my catharsis.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @FaulknerMemphis I let a lot of my daily frustrations out on players/teams who have certain personalities.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @FaulknerMemphis what I mostly meant was that people use basketball as an outlet for emotions. All emotions.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @FaulknerMemphis I know that, but I think it bothers you that others don't look at other teams/players objectively.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @FaulknerMemphis most fans are in it for distraction, fun, and human component.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @FaulknerMemphis if sports could be reduced to analytics 100%, then there would be no point in playing the games.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @FaulknerMemphis I yell maniacally at refs &amp; players @ games. If I did same on the street, I'd be committing assault.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 @FaulknerMemphis I think you expect people to look at something they do for fun objectively. Not gonna happen.
@JessiSheron hope you feel better
@ReynoldsRant @RickTrotter @jmj1757 @FaulknerMemphis that describes a lot of us pretty well.
@JessiSheron really feeling for you lately. I depend on my wife for so much. I'd be a mess if she was gone for more than a few days.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 tests could all come back negative for the other stuff. He's probably getting a CT scan
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant concussion seems like the least bad possibility.
@jmj1757 @ReynoldsRant No, dude. They could put 100 stitches in on-site. He went for imaging for fracture/concussion at best
@ReynoldsRant @JoeMullinax no one else has that much spite.
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 hospital bad
@KateeForbis except the Clippers...  LOL
Unfortunately we can't enjoy this Pyrrhic victory.
Anyone else think the rim is being sadistic tonight?
@jmj1757 also, to be safe - No gatherings of Grizz fans greater than 5.
If we lose because of a dirty move by a Blazers player...
@ReynoldsRant playoff Vince
@Skalded I swear they're foleyed
@jmj1757 follows Damian Lillard and lobs an old apropos tweet to his timeline at the same time.
How sad is it that we're all like "Oh good, just a blow to the head with an open wound and possible concussion..."
@bellmemphis yes, and she seems to be badass
Nooooooooooo!
@Politics_Prose @neilhimself Neverwhere #GaimanDC
As a Grizzlies fan, a double digit lead makes me extremely nervous. Down two is where I'm comfortable.
@FaulknerMemphis not kidding, he was so still, I was kinda worried he broke his neck and died in front of all of us.
@MrChuck_901 @natediggy75 @RockWigsnatch @Skalded I think you're all high...
@jmj1757 So let it be written. So let it be done.
@Skalded @RockWigsnatch @natediggy75 facepalm
Playoff Vince Carter!
@Crass_Feral @MeTweetForFood she'll never take off her Bayless jersey.
CHOO CHOO! Look out, the KK Express coming through!

GM1: 35 PTS/7 REB/4 BLK
GM2: 26 PTS/10 REB/2 BLK
GM3: 29 PTS/15 REB/3 BLK
GM4: 36 PTS/11…
Grizzlies!
@ReynoldsRant 1) Grizzlies fanatics 2) Grizzlies are winning the title 3) I honestly don't enjoy a offense-heavy game. I much prefer defense
@ReynoldsRant No, Austin. No.
Welp. Now the Warriors hate begins. I can't hate Portland, so let's sweep them and crush these punks.
@ReynoldsRant @CAGrizBeat I think this means Russdiculousness time!
@ReynoldsRant @jmj1757 "yeah, dinner was really awkward because Janet and Ralph were playing footgolf under the table the whole time."
@jmj1757 to be honest, it sounds sexual.
@NickPitarra needs more nudity
@brandondevin same
@jmj1757 indeed.
The best thing about the Bucks win is the video of all the sad Bulls fans in the Bucks' arena. Go home, losers.
Well, this is fun. 
@bellmemphis @mkmcanin @CBradyMem rhyming always better
@KateeForbis not much
@KateeForbis sleeping sucks.. More Playoffs!
Twitter is weird b/c someone favorited my tweet about a Kickstarter to condone a violent act &amp; now I'm looking at pics of mountain tapirs.
@TommyFPatterson @Franco0710 @RyanStegman @NickPitarra let's Kickstarter this!
@tattoosandbones i think you mean ALBAMIAN.
@BenTBrown @ESPNNBA two or three only. He pretty much spent the 4th quarter dejected. It was fun.
So Dallas scored 72 in the first half of their game. The Clippers scored 73 for their entire game.
@ColleenDoran what kind of ice cream? #ImportantQuestions
The only thing this game is missing is a Chris Paul ejection.
@mkmcanin Woo-hoo!
@PhotoNikki Kawhi Leonard.
@BradPee @PhotoNikki strong work, Brad
@TheBurnham whoa.
Big Baby in this game is like bringing a water hose to clean up Chernobyl
@ReynoldsRant deal with devil
@Yaciuk I CAN'T HEAR YOU SAYING THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE WHEN USING A TEXT-BASED MEDIUM.
@Yaciuk you can't see me, but my fingers are in my ears and I'm saying "lalala".
Griffin tries to be fancy. Ends up a Nancy.
@mkmcanin zero chill
This is Kawhi Leonard's "screw Curry and Harden, I'm MVP!" game
I know we want the Clippers to win for our sake, but this game is making me very happy.
What Pop was saying: "We'll meet again in the conference finals. There will be blood..."
