People have a habit of doing WRONG and OFFENSIVE things then getting upset when people don't just sit down and take it.
If we keep "fighting back," they're gonna fight back too. More lives will be lost. So exactly who will be winning then?
And all these idiots saying "if we give in the terrorists win" need to shut up
The freedom of speech that you defend and hide under doesn't protect you from whatever consequences arise b/c of your complete disrespect.
I am deeply sorry about the lives lost. Nobody should be brutally murdered.
I believe in freedom of speech when the speech is BENEFICIAL AND NECESSARY. If you're just using to be an asshole, I'm not about it.
Sorry but I am not Charlie. I am not for continuously disrespecting other religions. I am not for discrimination and utter stupidity.
