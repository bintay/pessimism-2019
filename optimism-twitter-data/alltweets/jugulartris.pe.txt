Feel sorry for The Tide cause they're under the same management as The Vamps ://
@EXTREMEBRADLEY i am
I could have been at work tomorrow earning money instead of wasting it on the vamps
What a waste of time this weekend has been I'd rather have sat and done my college work
@EXTREMEBRADLEY I just can't believe it. I shouted on Tristan and he walked straight past me lol
I can't believe I'm actually crying over guys who really aren't worth the time or money
11:11 Joe stops being a fucking wank stain
@EXTREMEBRADLEY @TheVampsband @stifffffy we left <PENSIVE FACE>
Not going to meet Tristan in Birmingham and then that's tour done and I'll have to wait another year to not meet him
So so disappointed <PENSIVE FACE>
I've spent SO much money on those fucking boys and I don't even get acknowledged?? They can get themselves to fuck
Literally sick of everything
@janaeamira @TheTide bleughhhhh
@janaeamira tide signing u were with people

@janaeamira I'm so ipset
Joe is a class A WANKER
@janaeamira legit 10 minutes ago
I got up at 3am this morning to travel down, I've had 2 hours sleep and they can't even stop for two seconds to get one picture fuck them
Nobody knows how mad I am
I don't even want to go next week someone buy my tickets
I can't believe I'm crying let a stupid fucking bad I am so fucking done
I'm actually in tears
Never been so mad and upset in my entire life m
I'm actually going to cry
@janaeamira we beat them to the hotel and Joe said "they can't stop because it's cold and they need to get out the rain" there's 7 of us
@JoeJONeill All I wanted was a picture with Tristan but no! If it wasn't for us the wouldn't be playing arenas :))
@JoeJONeill bit shit how the boys cant stop for TWO SECONDS to meet six fans. Its not like I travelled from Glasgow for this gig or anything
