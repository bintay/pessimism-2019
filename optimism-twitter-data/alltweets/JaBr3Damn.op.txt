Deandre Jordan makes Dwight Howard look so normal. That's crazy.
Fuck em lol straight up  
Cause he still a hoe 
I was talkin shit about DRose all game. He made up for all them dumb ass passes.
Oh shit
This why I don't like Lebron. He gets no foul calls on him.
@PostBadBeards this all I got til tomorrow <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
Derrick Rose so irritating
Derrick Rose the worst passer in the league
Jimmy Butler locking Lebron up
The world was just about to end an hour ago in Oklahoma. I look outside now and it's clear. <NEUTRAL FACE>
Derrick Rose is borderline trash
@LoveIsTheFlame lol yours is coming soon
Rain always ruins plans.

@ThatPrettyMexii thank you tori!
I'm a prince. I don't wake up like the rest do.
Go ahead and #Preach. #Amen
Also if you can sing? Automatic juice.
Basically.  
@Jonvh5 at the end of the day you still 6'7" lol
@Jonvh5 the only things that saved me from doom. You got the 3 golden traits. Dance. Height. Hoop.
I'm 5'11" in the right shoes. I had to find other ways lol

But #oomf gotta be closest thing to an even 10 I've ever seen in person.
I haven't used that lil "oomf" thing in like a year.
Tall dudes always win. And he can dance. That's the two biggest attributes 
@Jonvh5 you don't have to follow s blueprint. You follow your own guidelines. I'm try a get to that point
@Lovee_Dorothyy @Jonvh5 so it's refillable? Ahh, we understand
@Jonvh5 and you can't really do it RIGHT after you see em. Cause it looks like you was plotting. The timing and approach gotta be perfect
@Lovee_Dorothyy @Jonvh5 if anything, you got the juice
I need one night to recreate New Years
@Jonvh5 if you sending the initial message after 3, you skating on very thin ice UNLESS you saw them that night
@ImRudee_ it's the American way
@Jonvh5 @Lovee_Dorothyy I have conditional juice. Jonah has the juice regardless
@Lovee_Dorothyy @Jonvh5 it's basically science
Either you a superstar or you a role player.
@Jonvh5 gotta catch em before they fall asleep though. If they see that message that's been simmering for 9 hours...you out for good
Is that not what the founding fathers built this country on?  
@Jonvh5 only minimal juice needed during these hours
This them hours when you finesse the inbox ever so delicately.
Someone right now just got a "aye you up?" text?
Ratchetness ensued tonight. To some degree.
Hennessy like NyQuil. Put you right out.
I'm about 2.5 seconds away from sending texts out.
Night one of graduation weekend...success.
Is it just me? Does nobody else notice this? Am I a visionary? Jeezus give me answers.
Some people are just visually blessed with all the NBA 2k skill points possible.
I really sat and asked God for answers. How is this possible? For the stars &amp; planets to align just right and this persons genes be perfect
Like in your head you be thinking "how is it theoretically possible for one individual to be THIS fine?" Have you studying biology.
Has someone ever been so fine to you that you gotta take a moment to reflect to yourself on how fine they really are?
@5HeadShawty lol that's me
Starting to get nervous.
I NEED ratchetness to ensue tonight.
The problem with most people is, they talk too much.

@AYOpita lol texting is boring
I'll read your text and not respond and then mention you on Twitter.
@ThatPrettyMexii oh now you wanna support em

Bruh I'm scared of spiders I can't deal with no wild animal
@kalexspring lmfao I wish I could retweet that
I'm weird. I legit think about stuff like this sometimes. What you do if you chillin in the crib and a bear walks in your room?
They need to just return these animals to the wild so there's no way they can escape and run up in mfs jobs and houses.
@Lspiiice you think you just playing until you walk outside and its chillin in the passenger seat of your whip
Pleeeeze jeezus 
You not outrunning no wild animal. You may be able to outrun a pitbull if you D1. But damnit not no wild animal.
I was gonna go to the city this weekend to celebrate too. Fuuuuuuck that.
If someone sees a tiger or a bear they GOTTA take a pic
Yooooo!!!

What are those headphone looking things that people are wearing around their necks nowadays?
@Broken_Prophet @LeanandCuisine nigga said "seduced" lmao you know he lying
Chicago had me nervous for a second
This is the run I was looking for
Chicago is so damn inconsistent
Perkins is in the game. if Chicago doesn't go on a 10-2 run, they need to just forfeit.
Chicago. Bruh. What the hell.
Wtf is Chicago doing <NEUTRAL FACE>
Good thing a basketball game is four quarters long

@VanzantHailey lol see that's why your bubbles don't last
@VanzantHailey you not putting enough in. You gotta pour damn near half a bottle each time
If you take baths with no bubbles, you dirty. Just sitting in dirty water.
Yall remember 600 Benz by Wale?
The end of a semester always feels weird. I feel like I have too much free time.
Two days away from summer.
I can't lie though. That Nupe stroll/shoulder shit is smooth af.
I don't care what I have going on in my life. I'm getting BWW every single Tuesday.
Graduation would be tight if we had entrance music like in wrestling
I need to go to the mall in the city this weekend.
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> 

I NEED graduation to be on Friday
@JalenPrince5 it's gonna rain Friday. Maybe
So. Graduation may be on Saturday and not Friday. My department from 4-6pm. So if anyone was gonna go...yeah. Keep that in mind.
What did I just watch <NEUTRAL FACE> 
Future is my brand of trap music. Gucci is way too ratchet.
This man says "regular" like 50 times
This is giving me the energy I need to get through this week 
How come i can get 20% on the test and it drops my grade by like 3 letters, but if I get a 97%, I go from a 87 to an 88 in the class?
They gotta move this "favorite" button. Scrolling through my TL favoriting things I have no business favoriting.
!!!! 
@CastaLasta lol you doing too much looking and not enough eating. Better lick the bone clean <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@lovelylikax3 lol they look gross uncooked. But they're good

@lovelylikax3 gizzards are delicious. You off that molly water lol
@CastaLasta now you on some other shit lol you just like strips?
@CastaLasta I don't like church's much either smh I feel like church's is chicken for white people lol
I'm a chicken connoisseur. Fried chicken, wings, popcorn chicken, chicken strips, gizzards, chicken nuggets, chicken sandwiches. All that.
@CastaLasta I'll just take them straight up, no honey. Now Church's with honey, BRUH
@CastaLasta their shit is so perfect

This new era of dudes is weird man.  
@4EvErToMiNaTiNg I almost forgot he was even in the game. IN Houston too
@ImRudee_ fuck em all lol
James Harden not playing like he deserved the MVP
The one time I root for Houston, they blow it.
Fetty Wap is responsible for two of the worst songs I've ever heard
Doc Rivers needs a throat lozenge. A Halls or something.

<NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE> 
"If you ain't married, you're single"
@TrapLordJu they don't have to lol we all know the truth
Be honest. Yall know yall not washing clothes every single day. You gonna wear dirty clothes again as long as they're not DIRTY DIRTY.
Chinese sounds good too though
Chick Fil A lemonade is too sour. I can't get with it.

Lmfaoooo no way 
@MaryDickinson95 lmao how the hell
Please lord not in the Kobe jersey  
@kahlilbmartin you just became my new response to texts
Ratchetness must take place this weekend. Extreme ratchetness.
Money ain't the root of all evil anymore. Attention is.
Everybody real until you catch them being fake
On another note, idk what days or times my finals are.
"So much on my mind, I wonder how it fits in my brain."
I'm getting too sentimental right now. Let me put on some Rich Homie.
Shoutout to me too lol
Shoutout to my sister, for being the example I needed
Shoutout to my fuckin parents for never giving up on me
This whole graduation thing is the most humbling thing I've ever experienced. So many people to thank.
If someone, anyone, even if it's just one person, believes in you...appreciate them.
And the people who support you and genuinely wanna see you do well...family, friends, whoever...don't ever take that for granted.
It's certain milestones in life that will make you realize and think about and feel so much.
@__Kofi shit is really real bruh
Step out of your comfort zone as much as you possibly can. Do shit that makes you uncomfortable. Comfort stunts your growth.
Actually one more thing.
Okay. I'm done for today. I'm sure there will be more this week.
If college is your route, do you. Whether it takes you four years or five or however long. Don't let anything discourage you. Or try not to.
People ask you where you see yourself in five or ten years. And you answer it to try to sound confident &amp; certain. But you really dont know
Do your thing. Stay as focused as you can. And don't be afraid to fail. You'll be okay.
Shit comes so fast and it's so much so rapidly, you can't process it all. You gotta take time to put it in perspective.
I used to think so far ahead. Years. For something that is now going to happen days from now.
@Dominiquehager shit is real man.
And don't compare yourself to anyone or your progress to anyone else's. This is YOUR life.
Life is scary. Are you gonna be who you thought you could be? Or will you come up short? Shit creeps in your mind.
You understand there are "chapters" in life. But it's different when it's about to be here and you're finally turning the page.
I learned way more about myself...JaBre'....in college than I learned in all my classes in four years.
Figure yourself out first. Way more important than grades.
The best piece of advice I could give anyone getting ready to go to college or already in it...
This the shit that keeps me up at night.
There ain't no set rules or instructions. You gotta figure this life shit out on your own.
These past two weeks...a lot more so in the past few days...I've just been reflecting.
I remember being 18 going into college. Vividly. Now I'm 22 on my way out of college.
Life comes at you fast.
Summer is approaching <EYES> @DOPEITSDOM
I need this upcoming weekend to be good to me.
@4EvErToMiNaTiNg they looking good at the right time
What if the Wizards go to the Finals?
Chick last night tried to tell me a jab isn't a punch lol
Wiz in 6. Chicago in 7. Houston in 6. Warriors in 6.
70s players are so real <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
You on another lever if you look a man dead in his eyes and tell him that his girl just chose him.
That's the most player line ever lol
You know the name of the game. Your chick chose me. Now we can handle this like gentlemen or we can get into some ol' gangster shit.
@MissMartecia3 he was off the goose lol had to be
When Jamie Foxx hit that "hallelujah" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
This them hours you slide in the DMs with such elegance and grace.
@ayeits_ray you loyal. If nothing else, you are loyal
@ayeits_ray but Mayweather picked Marquez to bits <CONFUSED FACE>
@ayeits_ray Rachel please stop lol this is getting outrageous
This the real winner tonight 
No MFN way  

That's why Mayweather or Kobe slander isn't respected.

They're the best of our generation.
I'm never ever arguing with a woman about sports ever again lol I just now realize I been wasting my time
@ayeits_ray A JAB IS A PUNCH lmao what do you mean <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> you want him to throw POWER punches all night
This is still crazy to me lol was I watching the same fight? Yall must not have bought the HD version cause mine was obvious.
@ayeits_ray you're gonna have your opinion regardless lol so there's basically no point in me tryna talk logic into you
@ayeits_ray okay now you being insane lol how can you be undefeated and weak
@ayeits_ray lol you're consistent at least. I think your like for manny, for whatever reason, Is in the way though
@ayeits_ray lol well I shall include you in my prayers tonight
@ayeits_ray I pray all this was sarcasm and you know Floyd is clearly better lol
@ayeits_ray as long as you believe he's better, that's all that counts lmao
This is so sentimental. But he still lost. You paid to watch boxing not a lifetime movie.  
@ayeits_ray do you honestly think manny is better? Like all bias aside
@ayeits_ray adrien broner is like 26. With 22 knockouts in 31 fights. Sooooo I mean. The odds in his favor to be better than pac
@ayeits_ray lmao WHAT? This fight was exactly like all his other fights. This IS his routine.
Kobe my favorite basketball player. I don't watch sports for what they do OFF the floor. I wanna see someone drop 81.
@ayeits_ray Rachel. Oh sweet Rachel. Lol really. REAAAAAAALLY? You know who's the more technical, fundamentally sound boxer. You know.
@ayeits_ray off top, who's better? TECHNICALLY?
@ayeits_ray why didn't manny throw more like he usually does then when they were in the middle of the ring? Like normally?
@ayeits_ray you not making any sense lol so you saying the objective is to see how many hits you can take? Have you ever watched Floyd?
@ayeits_ray manny must not be either then cause he was no where close to winning lol. Floyds a top ten TECHNICAL BOXER
@ayeits_ray he supposed to just take it? Lol I'm so lost. What part of boxing is standing there and getting hit? Clinching BEEN in boxing
@ayeits_ray so you want that man to throw 150 power shots? Lol that's what you're saying? Boxing is not a street fight or UFC
@ayeits_ray a jab is a punch lol what you want him to do? Throw 148 uppercuts and hooks? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ayeits_ray pacquiao wasn't throwing though <FACE WITHOUT MOUTH><FACE WITHOUT MOUTH><FACE WITHOUT MOUTH> lol 
@ayeits_ray what if manny got knocked out, would you be happy? If there was blood and stuff
@ayeits_ray you really like manny don't you lol
You don't watch his fights for "human decency" though.  
@ayeits_ray cause he's not the BEST, the singular greatest. He's one of the best though
Damn it's already 1?
@ayeits_ray no he wanted Mayweather to LOSE cause he said he's better than Ali lol
@4EvErToMiNaTiNg it wasn't an outright ass whooping but it was obvious who was better
It's BOXING lol he's not supposed to. Even if he ain't top ten, he's one of the best ever  
@ayeits_ray lol what fighter in any fight doesn't do that. Even then, you still don't take points off for that
@4EvErToMiNaTiNg I'm disappointed I paid 100 for it but if anything everyone should be disappointed in pac. He fought boring too
Holding is allowed. No low blows, no headbutts, not hits in the back of the head. Whatchu meaaaaan lol  
@4EvErToMiNaTiNg you think manny would've won years ago?
Stop this madness pleeeeeeze 
@4EvErToMiNaTiNg he came AFTER Ali so yeah. He set the precedent
I feel like Yall just started watching Floyd fights in the past 5 years.
Floyd was out here knocking out undefeated dudes though <FACE WITHOUT MOUTH>
Floyd is a victim of the times. If he was doing the same things against the same people in an era before Ali, he'd be the greatest.

Mike Tyson got his ass knocked out too.
Fam. Floyd threw AND landed more punches. I do not comprehend this.
Dre you must have bet on this fight lol  
Floyd used to put dudes to bed. Don't front like he's ALWAYS been like this.
Yall should blame Manny for making this fight "boring". He's the one who fought different than he normally does.

@totally_WINNING that was another day in the office
Lmfao bruh did you visually watch the fight with your corneas and retinas?  
@4EvErToMiNaTiNg not never, but definitely not recently. This how he wins
That looked way too easy for Floyd.
@4EvErToMiNaTiNg I mean when has he gone toe to toe the majority of the time in the past 5 years
Seriously  
@4EvErToMiNaTiNg when in the past 5 years has Floyd done that
People act like boxing is a street fight. You're not supposed to just stand there and throw and get hit.
Lol was he supposed to go 30 with dude?  
Yall HONESTLY believed Floyd was going to lose? 
I'm salty. I spent 100 for this. You owe me a refund. @MannyPacquiao
Manny out there looking like the average Mayweather opponent. Confused.
And tonight we see. There is great, and then there is elite. Floyd is on a different world by himself.
Floyd RIGHT NOW I'm his late 30s is better than Manny in his prime. Do not argue this.
THIS is who 67% of people thought could beat Floyd? <NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE>
Lol this so great  
@_LeaRose 8
Honestly. This looks like a typical Mayweather fight.
Yall ain't see Floyd vs. Arturo Gatti? Floyd can go toe to toe.
-#FloydMayweather
He shaking his head <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
The crowd would make you think manny winning.
Manny knows bruh. You can tell. He knows.
Floyd is so much better its crazy.
Floyd is Jordan. Manny is Drexler. He great but...its levels.
Floyd is on God Mode right now.
This isn't going 12.
Yeah man. It's clear. Floyd is on a different level.
Idc what anyone says. This is history right now.
ITS HERE!
People hate Floyd so much lol
My snapchat story is cliche as hell lol
We gonna tell our great grandkids about this.
That's the Burger King bruh lol the actual Burger King
Manny tryna get his followers up with the selfies. But if he gets knocked out he's gonna make meme history.
This the best night ever lmfao
@ImRudee_ you lucky we Ain't put no bread on it lol we may have to square up. I'm hurt <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

@TyZimm8 congrats G!
Yooooo!!!! 
67% of people WANT Manny to win.
Noooo way in hell 67% of people THINK Manny will win.
I can't believe this fight is really gonna happen.
My heart. I can't take the anticipation. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I'm so damn nervous right now.
After Mayweather fights you be feeling like you a boxer too.
Females talk too damn much during major sports events

This ain't no draw. Floyd loves money but he wants the win more than I think he wants money on the rematch.
Yall realize that a lot of the best pro athletes are awful people in real life right? Ain't everyone Tim Duncan.
The world gonna stop turning if Floyd takes this L.
This fight got me nervous.
It legit does feel like they won it all
Tim Duncan old af  
The Spurs may finally be done.
The Warriors gonna go thrash whoever though
They had a second though...tf kinda play call
I'm kinda hurt they going home in the first round.
I don't want this to end
Floyd still won though  
Chris Paul real as fuck.
CP gotta take it. Fuck an assist.
No overtime though bruh the fight comes on soon
These fouls killing my high.
If Danny Green hits this three at the buzzer.......
Damn. That was a foul.
BRUH THIS IS TOO LIT
This a Finals type match up in the first damn round.
This the greatest night in television history. Spurs/Clips one of the best games ever. Floyd/Manny right after.
This game is a hardwood classic
Danny Pachulia vs Floyd JuneWeather 
People may WANT Floyd to lose. But i don't think they actually believe he will.
@wolfdonny it is <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Bruh this game needs to hurry up and be done
@Lee_Da_G lmao he gave up? Floyd up yet?
Game 7 isn't over yet <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Is it on????
@Lee_Da_G what happened?
Damn. CP wanna win.
If I have to buy this damn fight myself, I'm turning my phone off.

Sweaaaaar these high school kids look grown now. Can't tell if they're 18 or my age.
@kahlilbmartin Lmfaoooo I thought that was me for a second
Still funny  
This a once in a lifetime fight.
@The_BIG_SIZZLE you have to literally destroy Floyd to beat him
The Undertaker lost at Wrestlemania. So anything can happen.
I don't wanna watch this shit if Floyd loses though
If you not watching the fight tonight I feel bad for you.
If Mayweather gets knocked out, can you imagine how lit Twitter will be?
@JennWilliams23 <EYES><EYES> you bought it
Zab Judah coulda gave Floyd that L
Floyd can make almost HALF A BILLION on this fight alone.
Manny would literally have to knock Floyd out to win. If it comes down to the judges, it's Floyd.
Yall know damn well Floyd isn't gonna lose. A draw maybe. But he not flat out losing.
$50 on Floyd for anyone who wants to bet.
Yall be honest. Nobody watches boxing unless it's a Floyd fight.
Somebody please have a fight party and let me come watch for free then leave
I don't wanna pay $100 but I can't miss this fight <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
My heart can't handle watching the fight live

I need to start going to the city more. Cause it is never <PILE OF POO> to do here.
I'm so damn bored.
All my friends are basically married
People don't like Floyd when he's cocky but they say he's boring when he's not being cocky. Lol wtf
Hearing Floyd speak makes me feel dumb.
Skip Bayless so annoying
So if manny loses, then what happens to God? <FACE WITHOUT MOUTH> 
Idc. I like cocky.
I like them both for that exact reason  
Life in general is scary man.
Shit is scary.
@_krysCarter it's not a good feeling
Happy, sad, proud, ashamed, excited, nervous, ready, hesitant, optimistic, scared. All in one.
Have you ever had such a mixture of different feelings that you didn't even know what to feel?
I feel like the only person who doesn't care about super hero movies
They're overhyping this fight so much lol I guarantee the week leading up to the fight will be more exciting than the fight
When it's finals time and you realize you haven't done shit all semester

Beer is nasty af
Doc Rivers daughter on Twitter mad af lol
@DreSongz13 literally every time
The Clippers play in real life the way people use them in 2k
The clippers don't have a system. Even with doc as the coach. What set plays do they run?
Pretty much  
Pop post game interviews are so classic
All the clippers need is like 11 Chris Paul's. All at different heights.
The Clippers just don't have what it takes
Blake just gonna watch the rebound. He got a 200 inch vertical and just gonna watch
GOOD SHIT SPURS!!!!
If the Spurs win this, they winning game 6 too.
@ImRudee_ fuck the clippers
It's offensive interference bruh wtf is taking the refs so long
Offensive interference. Tall bih. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
Please God let the clippers lose
Spurs gotta lock tf up
Well gaaaaaahdamn San Antonio <NEUTRAL FACE>
Only LA team that exists in my mind is the Lakers.
I hate seeing the Clippers do well.
This game gotta hurry up. I'm sleepy af.

How does sagging pants make you a thug? Im lost.
I'm almost positive people are using the word "thug" as a replacement the N word now.
Lol sagging doesn't necessarily make you a thug. Nice try. But nah.

You can "learn" as much as you want in college. But if you can't DO anything, then you wasted your time.
@SAADIQTAJ @I_HATE_VA I don't think he meant specifically one race
That's what college is about. Develop a skill. Find a CRAFT that you can continue to build on after you graduate. One that allows expansion.
@oddearl94 okay J. Cole <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@oddearl94 lol this one too iffy to bet on
@oddearl94 100 is a cme down if he loses lol
@oddearl94 lol a hunnid though?
@oddearl94 you brave
I'm not betting anything over $20 on the fight. If I bet $100 and his ass loses, then WE gonna have to fight. Cause I'm not paying up.
@prettylight_xo shit is pretty serious lol
@prettylight_xo it's 100 if you order it in HD
What if he gets knocked out? <FACE WITHOUT MOUTH>
@prettylight_xo that's what I'm thinking too. I just got a weird feeling
Twitter will break if Mayweather loses. ESPN will burn down. Shit won't be the same.
@prettylight_xo I honestly have no idea.  Idek what to feel
I wanna bet money on this fight but I know if I lose, I'm not paying up.
Bruh what if Floyd loses Saturday.
@trillass_lex18 <RAISED FIST>üèΩ stay strong lol
@trillass_lex18 GOOD
@kalexspring lmfao that one actually made me laugh
It should be a sin to be attractive and stupid. You just messed it all up for yourself.
I actually question why God made some of these people. Was He bored or...? I don't understand. <CONFUSED FACE>
There are certain times where I'm just like "Damn. People are annoying as fuck."
I think I just hate people in general.
Shit like this is also annoying. If you don't see the need for #BlackLivesMatter you just as trash. 
I hate a "well maybe if black people didn't..." ass black person.
@Mixbreed_beauty Golden Corral good af Yall trippin

In tryna go to Red Lobster soon. Forget the games
Bruh no way  
My team won 21 games this season. I have no sympathy for any playoff team.
@DreSongz13 they can
DRose way too reckless
@HopeSM10 unless we are evolving into Jesus, idk lol. Who knows
@HopeSM10 there's love there will ALWAYS be hate
@HopeSM10 that "it just takes one" isn't going to reach someone who don't wanna be reached. Without some kinda divine intervention, if
@HopeSM10 okay I mistook that one. Either way, that ideology is only gonna extend so far. What about people that aren't receptive to that?
@HopeSM10 about putting faith in humanity over him? Nah I'm 200% on that
@HopeSM10 one perfect.
@HopeSM10 what I need Him for? God is love, all that. Love your fellow man. All that jazz. Which I try my hardest to. But clearly ain't no
@HopeSM10 how? God ain't never preach to have faith in humanity unless I'm missing something. If I was supposed to have faith in humanity,
@HopeSM10 shit that people clearly don't follow
I'm not about to put my faith in no living soul. They bleed just like me.
@HopeSM10 Ima put my faith in God but that's about it
Here Yall go with this shit again  
@HopeSM10 because I can look at so much else and tell that love isn't present
@HopeSM10 Idk man. Idk how you can put "faith in humanity" when for the most part humanity ain't ever been shit
@HopeSM10 it's SUPPOSED to be love. But religion has never been love. People gonna always use religion as a reason to hate someone
@HopeSM10 they practice. Just as they always have since damn near ever. It's an overlap. Generations don't start fresh. There's an overlap
@HopeSM10 and even if racism, sexism, agism, whatever other ism's there are, people would STILL hate each other because of the religion
@HopeSM10 the WORLD? Like you actually believe that?
@HopeSM10 you are right. Until  they all find something new to be divided on. It will never stop. Ever. You think our generation can change
@HopeSM10 our generation can completely eliminate hate that has ALWAYS existed?
@HopeSM10 how so? If the same stuff that happened 60 years ago is happening now? How can you be so optimistic to think 60 years from now
@HopeSM10 feel. And nothing anyone says ir does can change that
@HopeSM10 like I said, I really do admire the optimism. But people are gonna believe what they believe, do what they do and feel what they
@HopeSM10 and eliminate hundreds, or thousands of years of a behavior(s)? I'm sure every generation says that. Yet it's always been the same
@HopeSM10 a change in one person is still just one person. You don't wanna accept it but everyone isn't you Hope. People don't give a fuck
@HopeSM10 I really admire the optimism. But even if there is an answer, which I don't think there is, the answer isn't that simple.
@HopeSM10 a family and the entire world for as long as history can be documented is different though
@HopeSM10 how can it? It's too deep rooted to change
This world ain't no good. It never has been and never will be.
That's pretty much what it comes down to  
Jesus himself gonna have to come back. Ain't gonna be no peace in this world ever. There can't be.
@HopeSM10 because it will never stop

The concept of Twitter is weird. You're basically talking to yourself in hopes that someone will care enough to see it and reply.
Dang I didn't realize it was 1:15
@5HeadShawty and then forward them pleeze
You not gonna change my mind
The "dating someone with a kid" discussion can get as heated as conversations about religion and politics

You can put a price on one hour of your life?
You gotta treat your time like it's worth more than just X amount of dollars an hour.
Hell nah 
Finals next week. So this week needs to be the opposite of all the other weeks I've had this semester: productive.
About The Money or that I Luv This Shit Remix will always be songs you can turn on and act like you're the one who made the song.
This summer I need to find a song that gets me as lit as About The Money did last summer
@JaRonChiles no comment lol
The bread aisle in supermarkets smell so good
J. Cole also killed the TKO Remix
J. Cole KILLED Green Ranger
They can't beat Chicago without Kevin Love

Hood dudes still put rubber bands on the bottom of their jeans
Hood dudes dress like Dem Franchize Boyz

@ikaika580 we just learned that in my television sports class like last week
@ikaika580 they wont make more though. They only get paid for the first four games in the playoffs so there's no incentive to throw the game
@ikaika580 they only get paid for the first four games for that exact reason.
@MaryDickinson95 <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> your luck ain't shit
@MaryDickinson95 what?

@BKlaskowski 22
As long as you prioritize right and stay focused, you should be able to do whatever the hell you want.
@iCarlyLynn lol trash
We in our late teens and early 20s. It's okay to live a lil bit.
HELL YEAH!  
If you party or drink EVERY night or EVERY weekend, then you may be overdoing it a little
It's possible to smoke and be productive and have goals. Same way it's possible to be a sober bum. I don't smoke, but it is possible.
It's nothing wrong with partying, drinking, staying out late, smoking, whatever. As long as you not overdoing it and it doesn't consume you.
@MissMartecia3 nah in general we trash lol
@MissMartecia3 Jordan Clarkson
Russell Westbrook will be a Laker though
I don't want Rondo on the Lakers so he can come mess my team up. We got a good thang.
Anyone who needs to know, will know
Keep em all on a need to know basis
This year is my Jordan year.
@MiLLaTiMe_10 but...they're comfy <CONFUSED FACE>
I need to go buy me some Roshe Runs
@oddearl94 @_TishDelish correction. If it's a girl and she's bad, forward it lol
@_TishDelish shit forward that to me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Just a little bit of Louisiana hot sauce goes a long way
Rihanna kinda annoying on the snap. I may have to unfollow her.
Who you trying so hard to impress?
Exposing is the weakest of the weak
It's too many grown people acting like high school kids.
How am I supposed to eat Popeyes with no Louisiana hot sauce?
I'm washed up. I be tired so early.
Sandy Hook, I believe that was definitely a conspiracy.
I really wonder if 9/11 was a government conspiracy. I don't know.
If you really thing about it, the best NBA players miss half of their shots. That's crazy.
@DreSongz13 @ImRudee_ stop it Dre lol just stop
@DreSongz13 @ImRudee_ you not rooting for LeBron to score 70 but them to lose. You root for them...the Cleveland Cavaliers...to win
Says everyone who was #HeatNation the last four years <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
Jalen gets notifications when someone tweets about LeBron lol
@DreSongz13 @ImRudee_ 
@DreSongz13 @ImRudee_ your favorite team not in the playoffs either. Miami not playing right now G
@DreSongz13 @ImRudee_ MFN Mario chalmers ain't lost an eastern conference series in that same time span either lol
@DreSongz13 @ImRudee_ he lost two finals in four years though so who cares <SLEEPING FACE>
@DreSongz13 @ImRudee_ 
@DreSongz13 @ImRudee_ normal jump shooting can't win. These dudes on GSW not normal tho. I'm just picking SA cause they somehow always win
Steph is doing magical shit.
@DreSongz13 @ImRudee_ bruh. Steph doing stuff we will never see again. Unless it's from him

1. Steph Curry

@ohdamnthatsher I been saying that all year
How you gonna call THAT but not the and one?
Ref what you doing?!
playoff basketball gotta be the greatest thing on earth
Anthony Davis got next. But Steph got now.

Steph is light skinned Jesus
The Pelicans tried. But they just got they soul snatched
If steph ain't the MVP maaaaan
STEPH <FACE WITHOUT MOUTH><FACE WITHOUT MOUTH><FACE WITHOUT MOUTH>

This man wrote a whole two pages and we can't use none of it. <NEUTRAL FACE>
@UphoRIAH worst part of LIFE
If you're gonna be a procrastinator at least be good at it
Shit is due Tuesday its too late to say you don't understand and you didn't know what to do.
You had one job...
They bout to fuck my grade up and then Ima not graduate and then Ima have to catch a body.
Group projects frustrate the fuck out of me.
Finals needs to be two weeks long. One week is too cramped
Today is about to be trash bag.
But Flocka isn't old enou....nvm.
Anyone who talks about how many or how much of something they get, 9 times outta 10 they don't get as much as they talk about.
So any time a dude makes it seem like they don't luh these <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>üèΩ's, I just laugh and let them talk.
I got older homegirls that used to tell me all the simpy stuff that dudes was really out here doing for just random chicks.
@thecarterj ME? <NEUTRAL FACE>
Being a female must be tight. Free stuff, get treated better, get away with anything. Yall got it made.
I spend too much on food for myself. I ain't paying for yours too lol Tf

So far, the white Kappa had been the most annoying thing of 2015
Blake just look uncoordinated
It's payday <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I'm never really nervous about schoolwork. Cause I've been doing this long enough to not feel it. But tomorrow has me a little worried.

@Hannah_Nacole nah
You can never be ready for change. It's new. You can't be prepared for what you don't know.
A lot has changed even in the past year
From four years ago to today, a lot more has changed than I thought would.
You still are <RELIEVED FACE>
@MissxSicilian we not shit
Eff all the small talk
@MissxSicilian closer to around 60
Sometimes I wanna check on people I'm not that cool with anymore. But I mean...as long as they're still alive that's good enough for me.
@thecarterj you the realest for that
How Tf <NEUTRAL FACE> 
I don't wanna walk on stage and fall. Or pass out.
Not gonna lie. The closet graduation gets, the more nervous I get.
Yall too old to play that "inbox me emojis" game. Chill out.
They just mentioned Edmond on the game lol it's weird hearing that
Aka Rihanna Day
I forgot it was WCW
Why is my quesadilla soggy <NEUTRAL FACE>
I'd rather be doing anything else besides this homework.
Guess I need to do this homework now huh?
How Tf is is physically possible to have 50+ unread messages???
Let me take a nap before this all nighter
He'd be a coach of the year candidate damn near  
@TheJ_Bridges every team is deep though. In the west at least. Every team is 8-9 deep if not 10-11 deep. Literally every team
idk if it's smart to bring in a coach from college though. Especially with no NBA coaching experience
@TheJ_Bridges you think they have the pieces to win it all?
@iCarlyLynn yeah you right it was tied. Well, one game away lol
<EYES><EYES><EYES> @russwest44 @Lakers
@iCarlyLynn if AD missed that three to beat yall, Yall would be in. It's shitty
Lol meanwhile  
@iCarlyLynn it's the most unfair timing possible. He had the least to work with
It doesn't seem like OKC has any chemistry.
Mark Jackson isn't necessarily a great coach I don't think. I think he's more of a great motivator. He's a speaker.
It's not even just the coaching. OKC doesn't have the players to win right now even if they were healthy.
It's not a bad fire. It's just a little unfair to fire him after THIS season
I'm shocked it took them this long to fire him
@BootScoopBoogie @_prettygiiiirl we had trash ass players lol we had mfn Jeremy Lin as a starting PG. We good with the coaching tho
@TrevinHopkins24 Its been long overdue
Now if Scott Thibbs gets fired...@Lakers Yall know what to do
Hell nah we good with Byron 
In all honesty Scott Brooks should have been fired a while ago. They run no sets on offense other than having Russ or KD iso
OKC makes terrible personnel moves
@deesimms21 we literally got paid to chill with the homies, eat Chinese, and listen to like...kid ink and old Chris brown mixtapes lol
@_Gringo_Rican_ lol I thought we were!
I swear Lids was the tightest job ever
Moral of the story. Do NOT give anyone the hookup. You're gonna get fired lol
They're talking about giving the hook up on His and Hers. Lol that's an area I know a lil something about.
Being funny and having a bomb sense of humor gotta be the hands down most attractive thing ever
He can sue her though. So now she got cheated on AND is going to court.  
16 weeks is too long for a semester. 12-14 is way better.
Big huge projects for class stress me out to the highest degree

FAV for Hillary Clinton 
WE ON 
If it's 1:30 and you still up, you're playing a dangerous game. 1:30 turns into 3:45 real quick.
@4EvErToMiNaTiNg how tall is ernie? Ludacris making him look like peja stojakavic
He said he has no game <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> that's real though
I always thought "the juice" was more closely related to charisma than anything else.
@BombShelbs_ so it's natural then
@Andyroo1991 this the most player answer ever
Once and for all. Someone define "the juice".
Ludacris short af <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@_StasiaXO PREACH THAT

How would you react if your girl actually really got on one knee and proposed to you?
@WatchYaToneBruh creative af. I woulda never thought about that concept

@NicholesSole I'm proud that you know them all <RELIEVED FACE>
@xoashleyle you the realest

@kalexspring lmfaoooo you got it on the money
Anyone that even remotely knows me knows my favorite NBA team, food, and rapper off top.
@HoldMyNettz trust me I feel you
@HoldMyNettz we need to get this together
@thecarterj fuck college
I had a project due in like February I still haven't turned in. <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
Sometimes I feel like I stay TOO calm. I need to worry more.
If you don't like puppies you gotta be Hitler

@fcknnjenn damn lol no credit

Snapchat flexing is real
The people who post the most on snapchat when they're at a party or the club or some event are most likely just standing there all night

The people I follow on snap are either funny af or annoying af
In my mind, high school stopped existing after I graduated. Ain't no such thing as high school no more.
I swear I wish I could be someone else and meet me for the first time. To see what I'm like to other people.
@CastaLasta hell yeah I be sounding so much different in my head. Then I hear myself and I'm like damn
You ever look at videos or pictures of yourself and be like "damn that's me"
May have to wake up early to do this homework. Because I don't see it happening tonight.
@MissMartecia3 curry been special though. Curry doing stuff we never seen. Harden nice af too but he not doing nothing tmac didn't
@CallieRivers25 that man tired
Light skins are weird man  
I'm glad the Pelicans made it. OKC couldn't have made it this competitive.
NIIIICE 
Anthony Davis can be a legend.
Do you think a Bugatti salesman is gonna compete with a Buick salesman for your business? They won't. Take the Buick witcho bum ass

Ima be up all night messing with this homework.
I gotta paper to write and a newscast to memorize. But the game is still on. So <NEUTRAL FACE>
Lmfaoooo he really tweeted this  
This update got me looking for one emoji for ten minutes
@4EvErToMiNaTiNg he'll yeah and he doesn't even have to be an MVP
I be wondering how mixed kids come out as light skinned as Steph Curry and Klay Thompson and stuff
@4EvErToMiNaTiNg hes gotta be more efficient definitely. But he doesn't need to score like 30+. He can score an efficient 18 and they'll win
Pau will always be a Laker to me
Jimmy Butler can break out this postseason like Paul George did a few years ago
Rose don't gotta be an MVP for the Bulls to win it all
@DreSongz13 I don't think they'd be a 6 seed if he were healthy
It's weird seeing D. Rose in the playoffs. I'm glad he's back though.
If they had Jabari Parker though...idk.
This the type of basketball I like to see
The Bulls not afraid to fight
I remember when Nazr Mohammad pushed LeBron down <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
PLAYOFF BASKETBALL &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
