Hubs down w anything that leads to se xytime. OL worked a treat for him in this regard. So this angle seems savvy to me.
@ThanklessChild4 Precisely. OL should focus on capturing NEW women fans &amp; should sell to men the way jewelry is marketed to them every <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️Day

 I "get" this = commerce. Does awareness of fans' proclivities/sensitivities convey ANY responsibility?
@AnnPitts1988 Yes, &amp;the fact that it CONTINUES. All onus on fans to view w jaundiced eye. Massive insinuation upfront. Parsing in follow-up.
@AnnPitts1988 I am offended by the continuation of this theme, when they KNOW how it's received. I have no RIGHT protecting me from offense

I wouldn't presume to know what she thinks, but she seems so gracious. I'd take using her name seriously.

@Caitrionation supports her charity, so it would seem counterproductive to block potential donors(&amp; unkind to fans). 2

@judyfranks @SigrunAislinn Must be a lil tension b/t self-interest &amp; show, esp w relative newbies. Do they get a say in promo? Veto?
@judyfranks 

Absolutely promo NOT optional. Avidity of promo does highlight irony of fans mocking e/o's enthusiasm, tho.
#youredoingitwrong
@judyfranks 

I suspect team players writ large? I DO appreciate dedication to promo after delivering such a fine show. Is too much asked?
@judyfranks @SigrunAislinn Y, while hijinx were fun, most stories weren't new(auditions, again)? Would've <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️'ed more insider/nuts/bolts info
@judyfranks 

Hadn't seen Paley when u 1st tw'd concerns, but u had a point. Fun, but missed opportunity to promote beauty of show, imo.
@judyfranks I do see occasional fan promote concept of each fan being fan in her own way. 1's w opinions re "hownottobeafan" seem more avid.
@judyfranks 

How about "sizzle"? Still wise to promote that? Necessary?
@judyfranks IMO hiatus length imposed on "loyals'" goodwill, suspect ptb glad 4 any/all fans? Baffled by avidity w which fans "police" e/o.

Essay of former media consultant complaining re "@" happy fans(tho well written!) analogous to bartender "burdened" w drinkers?
@ThanklessChild4 Wonder if peeps who buy ads get value if measures not capturing/properly prioritizing all data? Who's "winning" transition?
@ThanklessChild4 

According to my understanding of how these things are measure, YES. Begs question: do we need different measures?
@ThanklessChild4 @judyfranks Double-edged sword; gotta think loyalty worth cultivating, tending. "Get"marginalizing"loyals". Suspect unwise.
@ThanklessChild4 @judyfranks I'd be curious to know how brands famed for customer loyalty proceed: monetize, exploit, thank, marginalize(!)?
@ThanklessChild4 @judyfranks I'd posit(don't know) that "choir" are marketers themselves &amp; as such could be exploited in many valuable ways.
If you're interested in TRP's? How is your viewing viewed?

Target rating point - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 
That is interesting @judyfranks . I hope that policy is supported by data? Dunno, but suspect "loyals" may've cache that could be monetized?
Thanks @judyfranks! 

Tsk'ing of fans seems continuous &amp; never-ending? I'm OK w educating fans, but feel it's ideal to lead with gratitude.
@judyfranks 

Wd u comment(give ref) re fans who tag celebs? Correlation w buy-in? Viewership? %fans on Tw, fb? Lurkers v tw'ers v taggers?

Thanks Anne, I appreciate it.  Fingers crossed.
@SigrunAislinn @Purv_Eyor @BronteFan2 @npt91 

Thanks, Snorkel.  Just wanted to try.
@Ann_Pitts1988 @npt91 @BronteFan2 @ThanklessChild4 Just spitballing, would "please don't SC/post my convos work?" Worth a try?
@Purv_Eyor @BronteFan2 @npt91 @ThanklessChild4 

No truce, just no names?

Whaddaya say?
@npt91 @BronteFan2 @ThanklessChild4 @Purv_Eyor @Ann_Pitts1988 

Some find it invasive to have convo's SC'd &amp;'d like 2 b left out of fray?
@Purv_Eyor @npt91 @BronteFan2 @ThanklessChild4 #dontcallnames = place to start that points no fingers.  We've all engaged.
@BronteFan2 @Purv_Eyor @npt91 @ThanklessChild4 

Also, no names = less tagbait 
Whaddaya say?

#dontcallnames
@Purv_Eyor @npt91 @ThanklessChild4 ITA. #dontcallnames = starting place. Feels hurt won't b easily(ever?) mended. How 'bout start from now?
@npt91 @BronteFan2 @ThanklessChild4 @Purv_Eyor 

Hear you @Ann_Pitts1988. Not sure how to track infractions re posting blocked tw's?
@Purv_Eyor @npt91 @BronteFan2 @ThanklessChild4 words are unkind. We'll NOT all agree.  Some admit 2 feeling hurt.  Let's just #dontcallnames
@Purv_Eyor @npt91 @BronteFan2 @ThanklessChild4 Let's just start #dontcallnames?  Ugly may be accurate.  Delusional may be accurate.  These

<WAVING HAND SIGN>Guess I misunderstood? You want outta this convo?
@BronteFan2 @npt91 @ThanklessChild4 @OregonWeaver13 Clearly, feelings have been hurt?  No name calling is a great place 2 start, imo.
@npt91 @BronteFan2 @ThanklessChild4 @OregonWeaver13 

Clarification: just re @Purv_Eyor or generally if blocks in place?
@npt91 @Ann_Pitts1988 @BronteFan2 @ThanklessChild4 @OregonWeaver13 

Happy to try<FISTED HAND SIGN>

To me this is important: "hurt" is what's going on here. And to what end?
@BronteFan2 @ThanklessChild4 @npt91 @blast4475 @susanzuke @OregonWeaver13
 
I think no name calling is a good place to start.

 I'll say it. I want people, esp WOMEN to be nicer to e/o.
@blast4475 @ThanklessChild4 @npt91 @puffy_shirt1 @susanzuke @OregonWeaver13 valid. Blocks have hurt my feels, so I only use in extreme cases
@BronteFan2 @ThanklessChild4 @npt91 @blast4475 @puffy_shirt1 @susanzuke @OregonWeaver13 Didn't like those kinda insults slung at ck, either.

It's v hard 2 fuel meanness wkindness. This puts onus on the "kind" person, but she sleeps better.

Hehehe, I meant politically, w peeps here.  We disagree, but I like(even love) 'em.
@npt91 @ThanklessChild4 @OregonWeaver13 I LIVE in minority opinion. SO used 2 it. Doesn't mean I don't believe in myself. Seek commonality.
@npt91 @ThanklessChild4 @OregonWeaver13

Absolutely.  Age-old struggle between being right &amp; getting along.
@ThanklessChild4 @OregonWeaver13 @puffy_shirt1 Many've had hurt feelings @npt91.  We're adults/it's price of trade. OK 2 try 2 improve, tho
@npt91 @susanzuke @ThanklessChild4 @OregonWeaver13 Truly sorry @puffy_shirt1 If I seem to have called you out.  Happy to have u weigh in.
@Purv_Eyor @sue_mcc1111 @ThanklessChild4 @OregonWeaver13 Haven't investigated yet. Just know I want u &amp; Puffy to coexist.  Like you both.
@Purv_Eyor @sue_mcc1111 @ThanklessChild4 @OregonWeaver13 FS. At some pt, some1 must rise above. Some1 can promote positivity. A hand extends
@npt91 @ThanklessChild4 @OregonWeaver13 imo, yes.  Celebs don't need gladiators on Tw.  Vouching is fine, but at expense of others feelings?
@puffy_shirt1 @npt91 @susanzuke @ThanklessChild4 @OregonWeaver13 

Don'tcha find any merit in trying to raise level of discourse?
Thanks @blast4475 !
@ThanklessChild4 @OregonWeaver13 JS @npt91 I think some tiptoe around celeb's feelings while trampling those of peeps on here.
@sue_mcc1111 @Purv_Eyor @ThanklessChild4 @OregonWeaver13 fwiw, 2 me origin of conflict less important than how it's handled.
@npt91 @Ann_Pitts1988
 ITA.  Variety of reasons: unkind, often cowardly, diminishes argument(especially when one is right!)
@ThanklessChild4 @npt91 @OregonWeaver13 Perfection not req'd among friendlies, imo. I'd just prefer we give consideration to e/o(+/- celeb).
@Ann_Pitts1988 than concern for sanctity of celebs private lives.  We are real people with real feelings, too. "Delusional" = perf example
@Ann_Pitts1988 I'm trying 2 make the point that we have a lot in common, &amp; I wish we'd use our many talents toward amity to e/o even more so
@mom2tbb Usedta be my favorite. Seems harder now for some reason?
@ThanklessChild4 @npt91 @OregonWeaver13 Imo, there're hard lines; then grey areas.  Room for disagreement on those?
@Purv_Eyor @ThanklessChild4 @OregonWeaver13 Preoccupied, but will look soon, I promise.
@ThanklessChild4 @OregonWeaver13 

<RAISED HAND>I'm going for a moratorium on name calling if anyone wants to join?

Imo, celeb status renders him susceptible to SOME criticism.
@ThanklessChild4 @OregonWeaver13 I think it DOES. 4 myself, I value the feelings of peeps who share on here enough to take some care w them.
@ThanklessChild4 @OregonWeaver13 Yup, &amp; thats exactly what saddens me. We could be a powerful force together. Or we could fight about a man.
@ThanklessChild4 @OregonWeaver13 Since it's played out publicly, I suspect it's aggrandizing oneself at another's expense? Bet it's studied.
@OregonWeaver13 

A bit like road rage, imo.  More personal though.
