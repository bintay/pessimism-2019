Open your minds....
The same thing happened in the middle east. You have government that functions as if it doesnt care about its citizens so the citizens rebel
This just a compilation of my observations while trapped in this God forsaken nation
With these police killing unarmed ppl in America the youth in America see ISIS as a way to rebel aginst the oppressive American government
You have police killing unarmed American youth at the same time the terror group ISIS is trying to recruit the American youth. Not good

For some ppl, life living in a hell is worse than a life living in a jail. George Zimmerman.
I blame the prosecutors more tho. Zimmerman played the system and beat it. The prosecutors should be ashamed of themselves
How to beat a murder case 101: Say your name is George Zimmerman at your preliminary hearing
Darren Wilson defends shooting Michael Brown: 
I remember when officer Darren Wilson did that interview he said if he could he would kill Mike Brown again cause it was God's plan
Only in America are ppl like George Zimmerman allowed to roam free. In any other country on the planet he woulda been knocked off. #Merica
George Zimmerman the perfect example of a nonconvicted criminal. Theres ppl doing life sentences for theft and drugs. He killed and he FREE
George Zimmerman is the new Teflon Don. He beats murder cases and domestic violence cases. Gets shot in the face and survives. Smh
I always said this would happen. George Zimmerman is cursed from murdering Trayvon Martin and getting away with it. God don't like ugly.
George Zimmerman gets so many passes by the justice system in America. But God on his ASS tho! God don't lie! Justice will come by any means

LIVE VIDEO: 
George Zimmerman shot during road rage incident 
Police: George Zimmerman involved in shooting

George Zimmerman, acquitted in Trayvon Martin's death, suffers minor gunshot wound, police say.

Ok I'm done exposing the govt let me get back to this reality TV and social media distraction #BrainWashed
Wonder if this why its not such a big deal that unarmed Americans r bein killed by police. The govt must already view us all as terrorists
So if the government thinks u are a terrorist they can come to your house and KILL you without probable cause, a warrant and a court process
Under the Patriot Act the CIA has precedence to killed Americans WITHOUT due process if they are SUSPECTED of terrorism
This is all under the Patriot Act
They tapped ALL of our phones WITHOUT warrants
That's how ik these movies are ways to expose what the world is really doin. Movies like Elysium. Go watch that if u never seen it.

Remember Eric Snowden is wanted for espionage / treason for EXPOSING our govt violating our Constitutional rights They gon drop the charges?
Right in front of our faces today federal court just acknowledged the US Govt was illegally tapping ALL of our phones for the last 15+ years
The judge ruled Eric Snowden was RIGHT that the government was illegally tapping our phones. So they gon let him back in from Russia or naw?
I can't sell drugs to get outta poverty but my government can make billions cause they can lie to me
Federal judge ruled it ILLEGAL this morning
So President George Bush broke federal law by tapping all our phones. They have all our phone calls recorded since 2001. Yup

We live in a time where ppl are killing in the name of God and here we have IDIOTS hosting events in which they disrespect ppl Gods.
Gangs are a byproduct of government oppression. If you go into a neighborhood and oppress the ppl eventually they will form against you

Religion only divides ppl
Ppl put themselves in deadly situations
We live in a time where ppl are killing in the name of God and here we have IDIOTS hosting events in which they disrespect ppl Gods.
I hate religion
Some ppl will kill to defend their God's honor
I don't condone violence but if you gon disrespect people's God then you better be prepared to deal with those consequences. God is real ppl
Whats very sad is we have had a black President for 7years and he did NOTHING about the racially biased justice system and police in America
That last tweet is so fucked up when you think about the ramifications and irony
No other country is coming to save black ppl from their government like how America saved the Iraqis from Saddam
‘When governments fear the people, there is liberty. When people fear their government, there is tyranny" -Thomas Jefferson #FreddieGray
Black man shot and killed by police in Walmart for having toy gun he picked up in kids section 
The Washington Post - 
Watch "Talent Oregon Police, Open Carry AR-15" on YouTube - 
The other link is of a black guy that was at Walmart shopping and picked up a toy gun in the kids department and was killed by police
I'm gonna post a couple links. One is of a white guy walking into Walmart with a fully loaded AR15 assault rifle cause it was his RIGHT
@niurkostov I live in wisconsin we can open carry guns without a permit. You can grab ur gun put it on ur waist and go outside. No big deal.
You know what's more dangerous than a black man with a gun? A black man with an education #PayAttention
I have many white friends that have been with me when I have gotten pulled over and they see how I get treated by police they are SHOCKED
Ppl think that cause America is a "modern" society that we can't end up like the middle east. If the government keep oppressing ppl.........
They say it ain't race it IS race. Even if the police aren't racist the police system in America was built by racists so it's fundamental
When whites pose with guns it's American. When blacks do it we are THUGS
Blacks have no rights. The Constitution wasn't made for us. When whites protest and march it's American. When blacks do it we get arrested
IF the Bible is even true. This whole shit we call life could be a lie. Believe NOTHING you hear and only HALF what you see #PayAttention
Your social security number is your Mark of the Beast as stated in the Bible. Without this number you are a NOBODY in America.
But your $100 is only worth $100
The global banks have $100 but can loan you $1,000 then charge u $250 interest so they make $1250 off you when all they had was $100
They got everyone puttin their money into bulls hit 401k plans. That's NOT how u grow your money!!!! You a SLAVE
Money is the root of evil so they put GOD on the back of American dollars and made us slaves to it. Ppl worship the dollar now.
We all slaves to the American dollar
#PayAttention
They used slaves to build this country then took the money they made and started banks then gave loans to Americans now we ALL slaves again
Watch the media they full of dirty tricks - Tupac
Everybody in Baltimore should be protesting outside fox news
Hold em accountable!!!!!!!!
People ask me how I know racism exists in America. I know because @FoxNews exists in America. They are the media outlet for the KKK
That Geraldo ass hole had the NERVE to go to Baltimore they shoulda tarred and feathered his ass
Then they reported why but then ONCE AGAIN blamed the VICTIM cause he was a "THUG" aka NIGGER
@FoxNews NEVER aired anything about the #FreddieGray story. They o ly reported cause ppl were rioting. They didn't even report on WHY
@FoxNews only report black people when we going to jail or rioting so they get ratings. They don't report anything positive about us!!!!!
@FoxNews is racist @FoxNews is racist @FoxNews is racist @FoxNews is racist @FoxNews is racist @FoxNews is racist

#WhyBlacksRiot because WE built this country. All the big banks got their startup funding from the SLAVERY business!
#WhyBlacksRiot because a cop can choke us to death on video and get paid vacation for a week then come back to work
#WhyBlacksRiot we have no 4th Amendment rights. We can b stopped and searched arrested even while abiding the law. Just like freddie gray
#WhyBlacksRiot cause we have no 2nd Amendment right. They create petty laws targeted to us to make us felons so we can't arm ourselves
#WhyBlacksRiot cause we have no 1st Amendment rights, when we protest and speak we are arrested
#WhyBlacksRiot because the America flag equals: White for the white people, BLUE for the Police and RED for the blood of slaves and natives
#WhyBlacksRiot because a black man with a 750 credit score can be denied a  car or bank loan
#WhyBlacksRiot cause when we die the first thing ppl look at his our criminal record not how or why we died
#WhyBlacksRiot cause we only have 1 right and that's the 14th Amendment. We don't have 1st, 2nd, 3rd 4th Amendment rights and etc...
#WhyBlacksRiot cause we are only free cause of the 14th Amendment in the Constitution
#WhyBlacksRiot cause the Declaration of Independence says we should all be treated equal yet we are still slaves after 400+yrs
There ARE good cops. Matter fact there are GREAT cops. But the bad ones are EXTREMELY fucking bad
#WhyBlacksRiot because Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Freddie Gray, Dontre Hamilton, Frank Jude
#WhyBlacksRiot because I might be killed by police today because im black and "fit the description"
I just saw an article about how the Prince of England has a hard life. Mf are u serious?
#WhyBlacksRiot because every single leader we ever had was assassinated
#WhyBlacksRiot because if a white person and a black person are together and are stopped by police the white person is let go
#WhyBlacksRiot cause it takes 450 years for blacks to become equal Americans
#WhyBlacksRiot  because in Milwaukee WI they cut inner city school funding yet they are spending $150MILLION on a trolley downtown

Wether Freddie Gray ran is debatable. But once those cops saw his pocket knive was legal and he didn't have warrants they shuda let him go
The cops didn't even read him his rights. They didn't arrest him for ANYTHING. They just hauled him off smh
What happened to Freddie Gray is what the Nazi's did in Germany. They arrested law abiding citizens and sent them to concentration camps.
Freddie Gray is an American hero. He is the example of how a black man ABIDING  the law will STILL be stopped...

@cnn u do remember in the beginning police said the other prisoner could NOT see Freddie Gray since there is a divider in the van. Wapo lies
Only in America can u have a six figure career as a news anchor that slanders minorities and those in poverty
#FreddieGray won't get justice
Now they want to report cause a few blacks are rioting and they can say that black ppl are animals thugs and criminals
Fox News is the media version of the KKK. They didn't report on the #FreddieGray story cause it doesn't fit their prejudice dialog
Common theme with law enforcement in America is when all else fails at explaining why an unarmed citizen died they just blame the citizen
Fox News is reporting that #FreddieGray killed himself by breaking his neck in the police van while handcuffed and shackled. REALLY NIGGA?

Why does everyone in Milwaukee want to "stop the violence"? From all the Facebook posts I see everyone here has... 
Theres an estimated 900,000 cops in USA. Since 99% of cops are "good" cops then the remaining 1% means there are 9,000 bad cops out there <SKULL>

Cop acted appropriate on the video cause he KNEW he was on video. Once they hit that corner view he THOUGHT he could get away with murder
The cop stopped him cause his "third" brake light was out. Which is the brake light in the rear window above the trunk. Petty. Forcing it.
They gon figure out a way for the cop to beat the case like George Zimmerman
Watching the initial traffic stop. There was no altercation the guy just took off running and the cop shot him in the back smh WOW
Police departments across America are finally under the spotlight and on the hotseat. Shame it took the deaths of thousands of unarmed ppl
Ppl will call your music trash without even listening to it. We live in the age of pettiness

I do not understand how anyone could hate country music
