We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are.
How can you expect a positive outcome with negative thoughts? Always believe in yourself, no matter what.
Look beyond the words and focus on action. Words have power, but actions tell the truth.
You are what you decide to be
People don't leave because things get hard. They leave because it's no longer worth it.
It's better to break your own heart by leaving rather than the person you're with break your heart everyday you're with them
The only games that should be getting played In a relationship is in the bedroom
Sometimes in exchange for learning the game you first have to get played
A breakup down not equal a breakdown life is so much more than a relationship.
Number one rule! Never get to fucking attached
When a defining moment comes along, you can do one of two things. Define the moment, or let the moment define you.
@EricaStuyvesant I gotchu boo!
@EricaStuyvesant then I'll drive my happy butt to Harrisburg and bring him home. I can't take care of him if he's far away and I dnt like it

Just because something isn‚Äôt happening for your right now doesn‚Äôt mean that it will never happen.
Falling in love is not a choice. To stay in love is.
Don‚Äôt confuse your path with your destination. Just because it‚Äôs stormy now doesn't mean you aren't headed for sunshine.
If boo wasn't going to be in class all day by the time I got to Harrisburg, I'd so be on my way there right now. #HateKnowingHesSick <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

You can't change someone who doesn't see an issue in their actions.
Having a heart filled with hatred is only poisoning yourself.
Expand your mind. Dive into the depths of the universe.
The moment your mind truly awakens, you will realize all is divine and you will see how beautiful it all is.
Honesty is key because it opens doors to growth, trust, and better communication and opportunities.
Your emotions are neither good nor bad. They are all bearers of a message that needs your attention. Judge them less, understand them more.
It's not impossible to be positive 24/7, it's impossible to be happy 24/7. You can go through sad, rough patches and remain optimistic.
Making yourself "perfect" is impossible, so make yourself the best you can be.
You're stronger than you think, appreciate that you are the only one who can cure yourself.
They don't like you, but they will be checking your page religiously.
The best revenge is enjoying life without them.
If we're dating you can have your freedom. You're not my prisoner. Just stay loyal and be honest. That's all I ask.
No matter how bad you want a person, if your hearts are in two different places, you'll have to pass and move on.
Don't feed negative energy. Choose to stay positive.
It fucking sucks when you defend someone for so long thinking they are different and they turn out to be just like what everyone said.
If it's not meant to be, don't force it. If it's meant to be, don't fight it.
Some were born to be lucky, some were born to be fighters.
Life has no remote. Get up and change it yourself.
Don't think too much. You'll create a problem that wasn't even there in the first place.
Be so busy loving your life that you have no time for hate, regret, or fear.
Don't confuse the people who are always around with the ones who are always there.
Sometimes you gotta be heartless or heartbroken the choice is yours.
Life passes by so fast. Whatever makes you happy, that's what you should do.
Don't get to comfortable, everyone is replaceable.
If I'm weird with you, I like you.
Think positive. You woke up to see another day. Today's gonna be a good day.
If anyone can have it, I don't want it.
Good or bad, just smile. You have a lot to be thankful for.
Let go and forgive yourself.
Life has many different chapters. One bad chapter doesn't mean it's the end of the book.
Everything I feel is a contradiction of itself, and I do not understand any of it.
Deep conversations with the right people are priceless
The courage it took to get out of bed each morning to face the same things over and over was enormous.
Don't wander away from yourself to get close to someone else.
@EricaStuyvesant I need to see you like yesterday
I think I'm falling in love with you <FLUSHED FACE>
It's so weird sleeping alone tonight <FLUSHED FACE>
When I first met you, I never dreamed we'd be where we are now &lt;3
Find someone that makes your heart race, but not with anxiety.
We are meant to outgrow people. We are meant to heal people. We are meant to spread love and understand  that not everyone loves the same.
Falling in love and having a relationship are two different things.
Don't stop until you're satisfied. You want an explanation, ask. You want to be successful, work. Don't settle for results you don't want.
Not telling me something because you don't want to get me mad is probably the best way to get me mad.
People leave you out in the cold and get mad when you learn how to get warm by yourself.
If you truly love someone, staying faithful isn't hard.
In a relationship you can't just do what you want, you always have to think about the other person and that's what people don't understand.
It doesn't matter if it's a relationship, a lifestyle, or a job. If it doesn't make you happy let it go.
She won't break you like those other girls will. That's exactly why you're terrified of her.
I want you to know I can have it your way but please for the love of god, stay.
I want you to place teeth marks on both of my thighs but I also want your handwritten wedding bows to make my bigoted grandparents cry.
I want you to hold me down and make me scream but also kiss our kids other cheek when they leave for college at eighteen.
I want to be dirty with you but I also want to be thirty with you.
Just be fucking honest about how you feel about people while you're alive.
Drinking is always a 50/50 chance; either you feel nothing or you feel absolutely everything.
Don't settle. Don't finish crappy books. If you don't like the menu, leave the restaurant. If you're not on the right path, get off it.
Come lay with me. I wanna talk about nothing with someone that means something.
The person who broke you can't be the one to fix you. Remember that.
If he doesn't see your body as a masterpiece, as a complete work of art, get the fuck out.
Once you've accepted your flaws, no one can use them against you.
@EricaStuyvesant I'm down!
Just posted a photo 
I want my blonde hair back <WEARY FACE>
This is my life 
You seriously make me hate the way my body is anymore. I know I'm not where I want to be in shape wise but damn there's a line of rudeness
Life asked death, why do people love me, but hate you? Death responded, because you're a beautiful lie and I'm a painful truth.
Things take time so just be patient.
Sometimes people don't want to hear the truth, because they don't want their illusions destroyed.
I like you because I can never stay mad at you, I can't stand not talking to you and I can't stand the thought of losing you.
When my absence doesn't alter your life, then my presence has no meaning in it.
Whatever yore trying not to compartmentalism and figure out, I hope you finish soon because lately you're not yourself.
I find myself feeling like I've been here before
Can someone please tell where the hell everything went wrong
He was never supposed to mean this much to me. He was just some guy. I accidentally loved him and now I can‚Äôt stop.
I watching everything grow into such cases beauty and now day by day I see it dying and I don't know what to do to stop it.
Do u know what happens when u hurt people? They begin to love u less. That's what careless words do. They make people love u a little less.
There are two reasons why people don't talk about things; either it doesn't mean anything to them, or it means everything.
I'm so good at beginnings, but in the end I always seem to destroy everything including myself.
It's a frightening thought, that in one fraction of a moment you can fall into the kind of love that takes a lifetime to get over.
The further inside you hide the hurt, the more it hurts inside. All wounds need air to heal.
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for.
I am tired.. and it's so awfully difficult to feel sad and tired when all you want is to feel alive.
I still catch myself feeling sad about things that don't matter anymore.
I wonder how differently you would look at me if you knew what was going on inside my head.
People inspire you, or they drain you.. pick them wisely..
Sometime I regret being nice, apologizing when I didn't do anything wrong, and for making unworthy people a priority in my life.
What's the worst thing I've stolen? Probably little pieces of other's lives. Where I've either wasted time or hurt them in some way.
I'm really afraid to feel happy because it never lasts.
The loneliest moment in someone's life is when they're watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do it stare blankly.
You had so many beautiful thoughts but never had the courage to share them.
The best way to find your own happiness, is to help others find theirs.
Some people are so broken, they get mad at you for being whole.
You can graduate from the best, most elite college, but if you're clueless about the world and society, you don't know anything.
I'm attracted to intelligence, not education.
The truth is, I pretend to be a cynic, but I am really a dreamer who is terrified of wanting something she may never get.
@EricaStuyvesant k bye
Boy you're like an anchor in the heart of a storm. Saving me and drowning me all at the same time.
These moments, are what matter.

Don't ask questions you're not sure you want the answer too.

Baby when were good you know were great.
Loyalty is a rare trait nowadays
You had me, but wanted more.
You're allowed to be happy.
Do whatever that makes you happy.
In the end, I wasn't enough.
Let's escape the world with music.
Everyone cares when it's too late.
What if I used up all my happy?
Music is blasting but yet all I hear is your laugh.
There are words inside of me that paper cannot handle.
Please stop taking up every single one of my thoughts.
I comfort people with words I need to hear myself.
What we suffer now is nothing compared to the glory that will be revealed.

@Nylanairb you in town

@nicolexoxolynn April 2 me, you, and Bree!
@nicolexoxolynn story of my life 
Never get used to the chapter you're in cause  someone always turns the page and everything will change.
It amazes me how something so beautiful can change to being so cold in seconds.
You can never let yourself feel any emotion because no matter what it is that's making you feel some type of way changes in a blink
I'm the constant and everything around me changes
I'll always care for you, no matter what happens between us
The person on your mind while you're unable to sleep is usually responsible for your happiness, pain or both.
Sometimes you have to walk away from people, not because you dont care, but because they don't.
Never ignore a person who loves and cares for you, because one day you may realize that you‚Äôve lost the moon while counting the stars.

Bitches find love, playas find love, nice girls yeah not so much
It's a shark eat shark world and if you're a gold fish you don't stand a chance
So pretty much, I'll always be the girl that gets fucked over.
I'll always be the nice girl that does everything to make the people she cares about happy.
I was fine before you, I'll be fine without.

What's good tanning places around here?
The moment you're ready to quit is usually the moment right before the miracle happens.
Let exercise be your stress reliever, not food.
You're not hungry, you're bored. Drink some water and learn the difference.
I thought I wanted a career, turns out I just wanted big paychecks.
He who smiles in a crisis has found someone to blame.
The early bird might get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.
Knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is not putting a tomato in a fruit salad.
You fill empty spaces in my heart.

Sometimes, you just need a break. In a beautiful place. Alone. To figure everything out.
When you look at a person, any person, remember that everyone has a story. Everyone has gone through something that has changed them.
That's the thing about pain, it demands to be felt.
We're not broken, just bent.
There comes a time when you have to choose between turning the page and closing the book.
Starting today, I need to forget what's gone. Appreciate what still remains and look forward to what's coming next.
The sun loved the moon so much he died every night to let her breathe.
My brain has too many tabs open.
Remember how far you've come, not just how far you have to go. You're not where you want to be, but neither are you where you used to be.
Learn to let things you cannot control go.
She's a dreamer. A doer. A thinker. She sees possibility everywhere.
Be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about.
You're helpful, and you're loved, and you're forgiven, and you're not alone.
Be a warrior, not a worrier.
No one is too old for fairytales.
Don't be afraid to fail, be afraid not to try.
Before Alice got to wonderland she had to fall pretty hard down a deep hole.
I think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy. bc they know what its like to feel absolutely worthless.
Maybe our favorite quotations say more about us than the stories and people we're quoting.
In the world, we only regret the chances we didn't take.
Its up to you to find beauty in the ugliest days.
Never lose your sense of wonder.
PLay the laughter, pause the memories, stop the pain, and rewind the happiness.
Don't be normal.
Screws fall out all the time. The world is an imperfect place.
The only limits in life are the ones you make.
Here's to the nights that turned into morning with the friends that turned into family.
If you world really hard and are kind, amazing things will happen.
Take me to the ocean.
I am the designer of my own catastrophe.
If you're not going to speak up, how is the world supposed to know you exist?
Just remember that sometimes, the way you think about a person isn't the way they actually are.
Life mores pretty fast If you don't stop &amp; look around once in a while, you could miss it.
Blessed are the curious for they shall have adventures.
Be somebody who makes everybody feel like a somebody.
This is why me and bae will stay together. Want the same life. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><FACE THROWING A KISS>

So... everything is sent into #ASU. Now its just a waiting game.
@EricaStuyvesant love you baby


I may not be there yet, but I'm closer than I was yesterday.
We are the makers of music, and the dreamers of dreams.
If you cant put your whole heart into something, you must take yourself from the situation and find something you can love. @EricaStuyvesant
Work for a cause, not applause. Live life to express, not impress. Don't strive to make your presence noticed, just make your absence felt.
When people cut you down or talk behind your back, remember, they took time out of their pathetic lives to think about you.
Never waste a moment, it may be the last with someone you love.
Sometimes things have to go very wrong before they can be right.
We can never change people, they are who they are, accept that. But you can always change how you feel about them.
Even something really beautiful can be broken sometimes.
You inspire me to be everything I ever dreamed to be.
The world is yours.
People will judge you. But in reality, the people that actually care about you will just be happy that you're happy.
Pretty girl, please don't lose yourself in your fear.
You gave me the assurance that someone out there still has hope in me.
dreams come true.
Nothing would be the same if you didn't exist.
To become one who believes two become one, you need love in your life.
I fell in love with who you really are.
You gotta stop forcing relationships. If someone doesn't wanna be with you. Just be like, "cool see ya never bye!"
A woman has got to love a bad man once or twice in her life to be thankful for a good one.
Maybe we feel empty because we leave pieces of ourselves in everything we used to love.
I got so much accomplished today, now I'm bored. Guess I'll enjoy being lazy for my final few weeks before school

Everything is nothing with a twist.
The rub about reading good books is that real people can never compare.
One must always be careful of books and what is inside them, for words have the power to change us.
reading is dreaming with open eyes.
Just let me live in my world of books, keep your reality away from me.
That's the thing about books: they let you travel without moving your feet.
I do not read for I have renounced life, I read because one life is just not enough for me.
It takes ten times as long to put yourself back together as it does to fall apart.
Meet me where the sky touches the sea. Wait for me where the world begins.
Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.
Make it your strength Then it can never become your weakness.
Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not.
You accept more from them, after all, you've given more of yourself to them. the higher the expectations, the greater the fall.
This truth remains: Only those you care about can hurt you.
Always work with it, not against it.
Accept then act. Whatever the present moment contains accept it as if you had chosen it.
It's good to plan, but don't let the planning take the place of doing.
You forget what you want to remember and you remember what you want to forget.
We all have that person that we wish we could just show them how it feels to lose everythin to show them life without us teach them a lesson
Growing up, we all did things we weren't proud of.
we all have that memory that shoots into our heads when someone says "whats your deepest secret?".
If ur goin to marry anyone marry ur bestfriend that u loved before relationship ever came along, theyre the only ones that know the real u.
Marry the bestfriend that was your bestfriend before ever having feelings for you. Not the one that you date and then become close too.
I'd love to know when it all changed.
One minute I think you care, the next I feel like I shouldn't even bother you with making you talk to me.
SO over this!
Well, didn't think being sick could get any worse until there's no one to snuggle with tonight.
Double today, shoot me. Feel like I just did it yesterday, oh wait... I did.
If one more person asks me if I'm excited to be 21 I'm going to go nuts. It's really not that big of a deal.
These next few weeks are going to drag
I feel like my insides are being ripped out <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

It's not always easy, but it's always worth it.

Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose.
You came out of no where.
I did everything I said I wouldn't. My only mistake is thinking I had it figured out from the beginning.
I never thought I'd ever let my feelings get the best of me again.
All I remember is one night bein wrapped in ur arms with ur hands interlocked with mine &amp; thinkin about bad it would hurt if I had to let go
Your lips took me to heaven

When I'm with you, I relax.
It hurts because it mattered.
The little things mean the most.
Come wrap your body around mine.
I am both happy and sad.
We sin, We repent, We repeat.
Our hearts beat the same.
Worry less , do more, be you.
I've no time with temporary people.
I'll miss you when this ends.
You're allowed to be happy.
Make the most out of almost
Thousands of words wouldn't be enough
Loyalty is a rare trait now a days
She found home between his arms.
To love, is to be vulnerable
You can't break what's already broken.
I still remember where we began
The storm cant last forever love
He's a work of art <GREEN HEART><BLUE HEART><PURPLE HEART><YELLOW HEART>
Maybe emptiness is all that's left.
I crave your lips on mine.
The world I loved fell apart.
I don't know who I am

I don't wanna play the game but don't think I don't have a copy of the playbook.
Scars a most often not visible
Dreams in the town get cold.
Too young to be stressed out
Fake smiles only cover so much
Late night thoughts are the worst.
Let music flow in your veins.
Do whatever that makes you happy
Inside, I 've died a thousand times.
This life is a big nothing
I love the idea of you
Please don't fall for anyone else.
Become better and you attract better.
Those who care will find time.
Don't force pieces that don't fit.
In a world of my own.
His smile heals my broken parts.
I just want to be happy.
When a name becomes a feeling..
Quiet people have the loudest minds.
He's like snow, beautiful and cold.
And I'm afraid of loving you, I know what it will do.
I'm not who I used to be.
Sometimes I don't even understand myself.
We are memories yet to be.
We're just lost souls, aren't we?
Don't punish the one in front of you, for the mistakes made by the one behind you.
"If you feel the need to insult your ex or their new lover, then you probably still have feelings for them." @EricaStuyvesant
I don't know how this happened.
If you're tired of starting over, stop giving up.

Let there be fuck boys.
One day, you mean everything. The next day, you don't exist anymore.
I'm so confused on this whole situation, all I know out of it, is he makes me happy.. @EricaStuyvesant
For my birthday, I want VS<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
There's nothing better than when someone remembers small details about you.
Sometimes I can be a emotion wreck and other times I can be a cold heartless bitch, there's no in between.
I prefer to stay lowkey, leave people clueless, and let them assume what they want.
Don't mistake my kindness for weakness
There trust issues gonna fuck shit up. 0-100
You will never be happy if you continue to hold on to the things that make you sad.
Never give up. Great things take time.
Your words mean NOTHING when your actions are the complete opposite.
Pain makes people change..
Got me feelin all types of crazy..
Sometimes you gotta accept the fact that certain things will never go back to how they used to be.
@EricaStuyvesant text meeeee
I have no clue what is messier right now, my life or my hair.
Can we talk about it? @EricaStuyvesant
I respect those that tell me the truth, no matter how hard it is.
@EricaStuyvesant what're you doing
Overthinking ruins everything
I really need me some new VS in my life
‚Äú@LoveOfMyLlFE: I'm glad 
And even when I don't have proof, I just put two and two together. And I'm always right.
What am I supposed to do when the best part of me is you?
kinda emotional, kinda emotionless.
Yall been over since June.. is there a reason yall are havin a conversation?
Saw you at your worst and still thought you were the best.
I feel like everything I've been told my whole life was a lie.
I can't even wrap my head around how fucked up my head is.
Always gonna be there for you, even if it's not returned.
All my friends are getting pregnant and engaged, I'm just here like, yeah I had that plan once.
My anxiety is in overdrive
Second best again I should just put up two fingers and leave<VICTORY HAND>Ô∏è
The pain isn't gone but I've learned how to live with it
My princess is barking in her sleep <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@EricaStuyvesant what're you doing
@EricaStuyvesant Why you no text <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I wish I could ignore you like you ignore me.
Can somebody please tell me where I went wrong.
Can't believe my princess is 5 months already.
Can somebody please tell me, how I ended up here.
One may think we're alright, but we need pills to sleep at night, we need lies to make it through the day, we're not okay.
Me loves when me and my princess snuggle on the floor together
You got me feeling some type of way.
You're right, girls would do ANYTHING to be in the position I am with you. It's the ANYTHING that I'm afraid of.
We are dating, but I'm afraid of someone else getting close to you...
When we first met, I had no idea you would be this important to me.
I wish I could read your mind to know how you really think of me.
Please understand I'll never be the one to hurt you
All I want to for you to be smiling and happy
You're part of my routine now, talking to you, sleeping with you, kissing you, I don't know what to do..
Somewhere between Hello to spending every night with you, I ended up deeper in this than I ever wanted to..
When you're bestfriend is hurting, you hurt too.
Can we just.... not tonight...
You're born &amp; then you die, but in between you can do anything u want. It's society that creates rules for us, but u can break out of that
Can you like not talk to your ex that would be great <RAISED HAND>

Can someone please make this headache of 2 days go away <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I hate that I see all of this with you. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
I choose you, and I'll choose you, over and over and over. Without pause, without a doubt, in a heartbeat. I'll keep choosing you.
Don't judge my choices without understanding my reasons.
Finally bed time with boo boo <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will.
Everything you've ever wanted is on the other side of fear.
Sometimes following your heart means losing your mind.
The best is yet to come.
You would always be what I could call "home"
You weren't the window from which sunlight seeped in, or the hinges of the doors that would welcome me in.
You weren't the bed I slept in after a long day of work, or the bathtub where I would wash my worries away.
You weren't the foundation beneath my hardwood floors, or the roof that sheltered me from the heavy rainstorms.
If you do not pull the weeds in the garden, the flowers will never grow.
Tomorrow could be the day you actually mean it.
Yesterday could have been the day you lied your last "I'm fine"
Today is the day to stop pretending that you're okay with not being okay.
Too long to tweet. 
Appreciate the simple things in life and don't get caught up in material things.
Appreciate the good things in your life &amp; be thankful for the time you have with your loved ones spend more time with your family &amp; friends.
Set goals for your future never settle for anything less realize that there are others in the world with much bigger problems than you.
Believe in yourself and your values don't sell out when things go wrong don't let anything get you down always bounce back up.
I changed the way I looked at things, and the things I looked at changed.
If you get a chance, take it. If it changes your life, let it.
I'm not the same anymore, I'll admit it; a lot of shit got to me.
Growth is painful. Change is painful. But nothing is as painful as staying stuck somewhere you don't belong.
I didn't change I grew up.
Change is never easy. You fight to hold on, and you fight to let go.
Things change. I'm trying to figure out where to go from here.
Noone knows you better than yourself. So don't allow anyone to change ur energy. Don't waste ur time or ur life on people who put you down.
Don't be like the rest of them, darling.
Things change and people leave and life doesn't stop for anybody.
Don't complain about things you're not willing to change.
It's the unexpected that changes our lives.
It is your road and yours alone. Others may walk it with you but no one can walk it for you.
When life changes to be harder, change yourself to be stronger.
I can't wait to sell my book, design our house, move to Key West, and begin everything we've ever dreamed.
What I've learned is not to change who you are because eventually, you're going to run out of new things to become.
Change is the essence of life; be willing to surrender who you are for what you could become.
All you can do is learn from your mistakes, and hope you will never regret anything as much as you do now.
You can't try to change the hurt feelings or mend the broken hearts.
You can't change what's done, you can't go back in time.
Your life doesn't get better by chance, it gets better by change.
People change. Some to bitches, some to strangers.
Time changes people.
Make youre move before I'm gone, because people change, and hearts move on.
There is always a chance to change and make things right.
People can't change the truth, but the truth can definitely change people.
When people start telling you you've changed, it's because you've stopped living life their way.
They say people in your life are seasons, and anything that happens is for a reason.
You can change how people feel about you, so don't try. Just live your life and be happy.
Don't cry over the past, it's gone. Don't stress about the future, it hasn't arrived. Live in the present and make it beautiful
Every new day is another change to change your life.
The secret of change is to focus all your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.
I want them all <WEARY FACE> 
I'm really running out of people I like.
Find the man that will be your bestfriend even when he is your boyfriend.
To the boys, that give you a heads up on what they're getting into.
Well, I'm going to be up all night and dead to the world at work tomorrow.
Every girl has that one guy that no matter how sleepy she is, she'll pick up the phone if he calls.
Just be honest with me or stay away from me. It‚Äôs not that difficult.

As a girlfriend I'm not going to be okay with you being around girls that like you or that you liked. Idc if you don't kike them back.
You can tell me when it's over if the high was worth the pain.
So it's gonna be forever, or it's gonna go down in flames.
Let's be friends, I wanna see how this one ends.

I'll always have a mind full of unsaid things.
I speak my mind because it hurts to bite my tongue.
Be different, that's what makes you valuable
People get fake when shit gets real.
I'm not scared of commitment, I'm scared of wasting my time.
Love isn't black and white, their are many shades of gray.
Stop letting the things you can't control  bother you, just let it go
@EricaStuyvesant Babygirl ur young. U know when I was 16 I didn't wanna settle down for nothin! You'll find Mr.Perfect that knows ur worth.
Love when I fall asleep on boo's lap &amp; he calls me out on it &amp; I'm like nope no proof &amp; he asks me what just happened in the movie. LMAO
Love makes you dumb.
Boys are stupid that's why I have a real man.
Stop doubting, work hard, and make it happen.
I love that he pays attention to every little detail about me.
Before you I thought I'd never felt such hurt, after you I never felt such happiness.
@EricaStuyvesant Love you too babygirl
Isn't it ironic how we tell others to stay strong, yet we cant do it ourselves?
Men who take their education and responsibilities seriously are so much more attractive rather than boys who just don't care.
I feel in love with you.. I don't know how, I don't know when, I don't know where but I did....
I want to go to concerts and meet band members. Like now.
Nobody is ever too busy. If they care, they will make time.
@EricaStuyvesant You deserve the world not someone that makes you feel like shit.
@EricaStuyvesant If it helps my ex is pathetic too <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
The devil doesn't come to you with his red face and horns, he comes disguised as everything you've ever wanted.

You don't need a perfect relationship. All you need is someone who loves your weirdness, wants to spend time with you and respects you.

When you think something is to complicated, just remember even every book was created with a combination of 26 letters.
I was born with a reading list I'll never finish.
Books are the plane, and the train, and the road. There are the destination and the journey. They are home.
Drink good coffee. Read good books.
Between the pages of a book is a lovely place to be.
might have been a song on the radio
A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies.
Books wash away from the soul the dust of everyday life.
There is more treasure in books than all pirate's loot on Treasure Island.
Something about a midnight rain..
I tried to beat my reading addiction, worst two minutes of my life.
Why can't I just read all day everyday?
I don't believe in the kind of magic in my books, But I do believe something very magical can happen when you read a good book - J.K.ROWLING
I'm not addicting to reading, I can quit as soon as I finish one more chapter.
You have to work hardest for the things you want most.
Books are a uniquely portable magic.
Just bought 13 new books, SO EXCITED! #NerdStatus
I never realized how much I needed much and books until I sat down and really thought about it.
I wish some nights lasted forever.
Stressed is caused by giving a fuck.
I notice everything, I just act like I don't
Kinda care, Kinda don't
Keep your shit lowkey, don't trust everybody.
If you want it. Work for it. It's that simple.
Hold on to whatever keeps you happy.
You're looks made me say hi, but your personality kept me wanting more of you.
I need more money for concerts.
The time to be happy is now.
Happiness is the best revenge.
My thoughts always keep me up late.
Everything will get better.
We all go a little crazy sometimes.
Enjoy these moments now, because they won't last forever.
If you got me, I got you.
It's crazy how music can connect souls
You can't please everyone.
Don't let shit get to you.
I'd rather be weird than boring.
Be with someone who is proud to have you.
The best feeling in the world is knowing that you actually mean something to someone.
It's better when we get to sleep together.
Don't apologize, and then do it again.
We stopped looking for monsters under our bed when we realized they were inside of us all along.
LOVE this picture She's passed out in her daddy's arms while he's watching Transformers 4 
"I thought she was a raccoon" LMFAO
If I disappeared for a day, would anyone really notice.
I love having someone who will take goofy pictures with me and not be forced.
End of year flipagrams make me want to flip a table.
Kind of want a new year kiss, kinda want 15 shots of whiskey instead.

If we wait until we're ready, we'll be waiting for the rest of our lives.
The greatest pleasure in life is doing what people say you cannot do.
I don't trust words I trust actions.
To love it to receive a glimpse of heaven.
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone.
I've had so many words but I had no courage.
Yeah. You may talk to me, make me laugh and say the sweetest things. But how many other girls are you doing that to?
Shut up, you confuse me.
Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight.
Beauty is being the best version of yourself on the inside and out.
All the cute things you do simply tickle my heart.
I want to tell you how I feel but I'm scared of being hurt again, scared of you not feeling the same, and scared of falling harder.
Without humor life is boring, without love life is hopeless, without friends, life is impossible.
Your mercies. they're new every morning.
The scariest thing about distance is you don't know whether they'll miss you or forget about you.
You annoy me more than I ever thought possible. But I want to spend every irritating minute with you.
Behind those smiling faces you can never know what someone is going through.
Maybe she made you feel better about your miserable life, but you didn't love her. Because you don't destroy people you love.
You didn't love her. You just didn't want to be alone. Or maybe, she was just good for your ego.
To the would you may just be someone, but to someone you may be the world.
Forget the risk, and take the fall. If it's meant to be, then it's world it all.
#Imperfection is beautiful.
If someone were to harm my family or a friend or somebody I love, I would eat them I might end up in jail for 500 years but I would eat them
If I had a flower for every time you made me smile and laugh I'd have a garden to walk in forever.
Enjoy the little things.
#professional #dreamer
Dream you dreams with your eyes closed... but live your dreams with your eyes open.
There is nothing in which the birds differ more from man than the way in which they can build and yet leave a landscape as it was before.
I can fake a smile when I feel horrible. I can pretend to be happy. I can do a lot, but what I can't do it pretend that I'm not into you.
I Fell in love with you. Not for how you look, just for who you are. (although you look pretty great too.)
Forget all the reasons why it won't work and believe the one reason why it will.
Yes, I'm single, and you're going to have to be fucking amazing to change that.
The only person you should try to be better than, is the person you were yesterday.
Silence speaks when words can't.
I love people who can make me laugh, when I don't even want to smile.
You only live once, but if you do it right once is enough.
I'll always be too skinny, too fat, too short, too this, too that..
#Society taught me that no matter what size I am, I will never be good enough.
And then I met you.
Music is my escape.
The best part about pictures is that even when the people in the photo change, the memory it contains never will.
Whatever you decide to do, make sure it makes you happy.
Free yourself, from the chains you've wrapped yourself in.
I've learned that you can keep going, long after you think you can't.
It hurts because it mattered.
The kindest people have been hurt the most.
Be a #girl with a mind a #bitch with an #attitude and a #lady with #class
#Dream on #Dreamer
I cannot formulate an expression using tangible words from any language that would even begin to express just how much you piss me off.
Be brave.
I wish you'd listen closer to the songs I play, because the lyrics speak the works I fail to say.
If it's meant to be, it will be.
You can't change your life overnight.
A negative mind will never give you a positive life.
#Glee taught me that no matter how different we are, there's always that one thing we have in common.
#PercyJackson taught me that there's a hero in every one of us.
#Narnia taught me that we must all grow up and leave our childhood behind but must never forget it.
#HarryPotter taught me that love and friendship dominates all kind of evil.
#Disney taught me to never stop believing in my dreams.
If I'm louder, would you see me? Would you lay down in my arms and rescue me?
I wish I was better at telling people how I really feel.
Never make permanent decisions on temporary feelings.
Life, never was easy. Grow up, and accept it.
I swear, sometimes it's like you want me to hate you.
Dreams don't work unless you do.
Going to smile because I deserve too.
I choose to be happy.
Everything happens for a reason.
Choose to shine.
Sometimes you have to get rid of all the bullshit in your life, and just focus on the things that make you a better person.
Never let go of your dreams.
Keep your head up, keep your heart strong.
Don't forget to smile.
The laughter, the memories, the pain, the happiness.
Really thinking about letting my hair go back to my natural color, maybe then it'll get longer.
My hair needs to grow, so tired of short hair.
Can't wait to go back to school for my masters
Tell me I can't and I'll prove you wrong.
I'll be the first to admit I'm more than a little bit reckless.
So hungry but no food. As usual

Do you ever just crave someone's presence? Like you would literally be happy just sitting next to them. It could be dead silent but perfect

Even though you say I'm a great person it sure seems like being a "great" person doesn't get me anywhere.
Nice people always get hurt its like they wear a sign saying I'm nice and I'll do anything to make you happy so date someone other than me<WEARY FACE>
I HATE WHEN PEOPLE USE PEOPLE WHO ARE NICE
#yes #life 
I'm not desperate for a relationship. But, i do miss the feeling of having someone that can make me smile and feel appreciated.
My princess is getting spaded <WEARY FACE> so nervous <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
i just wanna lay my head on somebody‚Äôs lap &amp; have them play in my hair till i fall asleep bc that‚Äôs the sweetest most comforting thing ever
Being nice to someone you don't like doesn't mean you're fake, it means you're mature enough to tolerate your dislike for them.
Just posted a photo 
Feeling really ugly<SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
If someone else is entertaining you, can you just tell me?
I. GIVE. UP. YOU. WIN
I just need a day off from reality, just a day without people, problems, and all the bullshit that runs through my mind.

Yes! 
Be with someone who brings out the best in you, not the stress in you.
Two things define you: Your patience when you have nothing, and your attitude when you have everything.
Stay strong, be positive. We all struggle sometimes.
Your hardest times often lead to the greatest moments of your life. Keep the faith. It will all be worth it in the end.
Don‚Äôt depend too much on anyone in this world because even your own shadow leaves you when you are in darkness.
Don't stress what you can't change.
A negative mind will never give you a positive life.
You aren't rich until you have something that money can't buy.
One day, you‚Äôll just be a memory to some people. Do your best to be a good one.
Whoever is trying to bring you down is already below you
I'm chasing a life I'll never reach.
People will judge you by your actions, not your intentions.
You are not designed for everyone to like you.
Don't rush to fall in love, because even in fairy tales. The happy ending takes place on the last page.
Good mood bad mood ugly pretty handsome what you have find the one who loves you during all these times.
The best thing you can do is find a person who loves you for the exactly who you are.
Who wants to go out tonight!
Peoples bullshit and fakeness are the main reason I like to be alone
Seriously wish @EricaStuyvesant was home!
Gonna smile not just because I deserve to but because nobody should get the satisfaction of seeing me cry <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS> 
Swear I'm gonna be alright tonight, swear I'm not gonna let myself cry tonight. RIP
