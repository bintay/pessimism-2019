@takisiski that's what i was thinking lmao i'm prob gonna stop by VS and get some. we're gonna do the shoot friday night in our room!
YES third year love live pj photoshoot for fanime i am excited
@takisiski ok!!!! This is what I got for Nozomi btw!!! Idk what I'm gonna wear as bottoms yet tho. 
@takisiski we're cool with either!!!! if you do nico we'll have a 3 year group tho :o you could also wear the dress u and ponty made!!!
watches yugioh and reads fanfic while bailey bleaches my roots
@takisiski my eli is also probably going to wear non canon pjs too so it's basically just a general pj shoot for love live.
@takisiski so i got pjs that are not like nozomi's at all &amp; also like. sheer. so basically u can wear whatever pjs u want for the shoot.
throws that in the garbage where it belongs
i'm so betrayed my pork bun had peas and carrots in it wtf
Only uses nicki minaj lyrics to caption my Nozomi pictures
THE MOST INTERESTING MAN IN THE WORLD 
I got the slutty pjs for Nozomi but now I can only wear them in the hotel room
@blueskynoises ok thank you im good now
THE KIDS ARE ASLEEP" 
These would be so cute for pj Nozomi im so??? 
@blueskynoises I WISH I COULD RT THIS ITS REALLY ME

@Ariana_idsa 
bailey's house is more comfy than my house just bc a) my parents aren't here and b) bailey is here lmao
@tastynomnoms THE SU ONE IS SO CUTE I WANT
@Ariana_idsa oh no
if ariana watches bleach for aizen i'm gonna be diappointed, but not surprised
@Ariana_idsa 
@Ariana_idsa he's also has that hot dad aesthetic tho
@Ariana_idsa he kills everyone
@Ariana_idsa the main villain in bleach is named sousuke lmao
i bet there's aizen apologists
aizen can suck a dick
LRT i'm so glad someone else understands
@woahrebecca i have no reply no
@woahrebecca did u see my text btw.
@woahrebecca us: 
@woahrebecca 
all my friends are meme loving fucks i can't believe this

finding body pillows for male characters is really hard :////
YES I GOT TO MY FAVE BLEACH OPENING
luv best friend privileges
sticks my cold feet on bailey's legs bc she's asleep and can't complain
And then at the very bottom there's the $700 camera I want but no one can afford to give me lmao
Gives Amazon wish list to family members for my bday. Yes I'm aware it's  mostly anime stuff. I can judge myself just fine thanks.
@woahrebecca never even heard of it
My Amazon wish list is just anime figs and art books lmao
@woahrebecca what book is it
I just want a 60D or better camera......but money orz
Stares into the sun. There's a canon 60D refurbished for $450 on Amazon and I could afford that but. I would have no money after. Sobs.
i'm on episode 46 of bleach already lmao i'm skipping so much it's going by really fast
@woahrebecca at least you'll die happy, staring at meg in her underwear
@woahrebecca i saw your retweets pls don't die
why is bailey snoring i'm going to lay on her until she stops
squints i should use my personal twitter more but only like 2 ppl follow it so it's kinda worthless
i actually love kenpachi a lot like. 100% serious i love kenpachi.
i finished the bouaka tag....
actually i know how, i keep skipping parts of the episodes bc i already know what happens so i don't care about the boring bits lmao
how am i on episode 40 of bleach already
@vriskybusiness thank you!!!!! my butt is just big enough to make it short in the back tho lmao. panty shot time.
where can i buy a sleeveless sweater vest tho
actually i can probably just use my work shirt???? bc that's a short sleeve white polo shirt....hell yeah i can use that
now i just gotta get a short sleeve white shirt and a yellow sweater vest so i can do summer uniform for fanime
@vriskybusiness yeah!!! it's a generic blue school uniform jacket so you could probably use it for other stuff!!
Love liveeeee 
ok the skirt fits which is really why i  bought the cosplay anyway bc the jacket i could easily make myself. the skirt not so much bc plaid
@vriskybusiness it's the same one bailey bought, so if you look at her twitter pictures she posted pics wearing hers!!!
@vriskybusiness sounds good!!!!
@vriskybusiness i understand
@vriskybusiness is $20 good? if so i'll give it to you at fanime and you can pay me back whenever!
Who wants to buy a love live jacket off me bc I cannot wear this
My love live jacket is really well made but I literally can't even put it on my arms are too fat and my shoulders are too wide lmao
@vriskybusiness it was $15 from taobao B)
Look at how cute my new purse is!!!! 
YES i found my taobao stuff
&gt;walks into Bailey's room 
&gt;immediately walks back out
Made it to Bailey's in an hour and eight minutes hell yeah

i'm not crying over bleach YOU'RE crying over bleach
:----)))) rukia telling ichigo to die to try and protect him from hurting himself more :---))) rukia being willing to die for ichigo :--))
so excited to live off nothing but smartpop and rice and ramen all of fanime lmao
@woahrebecca fuck jackets and don't put off the cosplay until a week before the con
@woahrebecca thank u. learn from my mistakes in the process. don't be like us.
@woahrebecca except many snapchats of me crying and texts of me describing how i'm gonna kill my roommate
@woahrebecca (: 3」∠ ) they haven't even finished cutting out the patter :----)))) my neo jacket took like 20 hours :---))))
if i don't kill @Ariana_idsa by fanime there will be nothing that can ruin this friendship bc i have to help them make an entire jacket RIP
@woahrebecca well they're gonna be my torch so. we already bought all the materials we just need to make...the entire jacket....
@woahrebecca i have to help my friend make an entire torchwick cosplay in about 8 days please pray for me
last minute fanime amazon order lmao god bless prime shipping
god i've reached rukia's death arc noooooooo renji.....renji my boy........don't try to kill ur future gf and bf pls u know it's wrong
@swaegerjaquezz wow super late but happy bday!!!!!
i'm not getting paid again before fanime fuck my life. @ everyone buy shit from my etsy store pls
hell yes my nekoma camera strap ended up being a few bucks less than i thought
tbh the code orange opening for bleach is one of the best ones, beaten only by the metal opening
bleach is a really important show 
judging myself for thinking about nasty white boy #1 like god why do i still have contact with him
@ God why 
lays down. god i fucking love girls.
@takisiski same tbh i understand
@takisiski someone made like a nicomaki master list 
@takisiski mine is still rinhanayo bc hanayo is my fave but. god damn. nicomaki. too good, too real.
love live in general is just. it's so gay and i'm so about it.
Nico is so gay for Maki and i love it
aggressively tries to self promote my cosplay photography at fanime: 
tbh i'll probably just wait and have bailey do them for me monday
fuck my ass i do have to do a second layer of bleach on my roots they range from yellow to brown rn fuckkkkk
i forgot how much ishida pissed me the fuck off
@thetulgey_wood I'M PRETTY SURE BIRDS SHOULDN'T BE MAKING THOSE NOISES
@thetulgey_wood WHY IS THAT SO ALARMING WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT BIRD
i feel like i'm gonna have to do a second round of bleach on my roots :///
@Ariana_idsa give your bro a high five for me
happy mothers day mom, i am now blonde. what do u mean that isn't a proper present.
time to watch bleach while i finish bleaching my hair lmao
i know so many cute cosplayers god i need to lay down and breathe for a minute it's too much for me
@Ariana_idsa squints at u
i'm kinda excited to be blonde? i've actually never stayed blonde for longer than a day before so
@woahrebecca i'm making....a haikyuu!! au....for rwby........
i forgot how much i loved going to toms farms it's just really nice to wander around there
i got a hello kitty soda but i'm wary to drink it bc it literally just says "fizzy pop" for the flavor like??? what flavor is that
iwaizumi: no 
oikawa: but i havent said anything 
iwaizumi: just no
Chillin with the Frankie cat <VICTORY HAND>️ 
"Why did you get a Mother's Day gift since when are you a mom" well mom u see I made friends with a bunch of nerds and that's how
gotta wait for my laptop to charge up so i can watch bleach while i bleach my hair lmao
Is this U @thetulgey_wood 
Ariana got me flowers for Mother's Day lmao
My phone is consistently dying at only 50% battery now fuck my entire ass I can't afford a new one
We're watching the Jesus camp documentary and I'm scared and concerned for these kids
Primadonna girl <SPARKLING HEART> 
literally every time i see someone walk up to the cut counter with tulle i just die a little inside
i have an irrational hatred for fleece tie blankets and tutus bc of my job
put this screencap on my fucking tombstone 
Slept for five hours and now I feel like death
tattoos my LRT on my fucking forehead
@woahrebecca i'm watching anime from 2004. i really should lmao.
@Ariana_idsa i'm not gonna do it until i sleep some so it'll be fine
@woahrebecca it's 6.30am. i haven't slept yet.
@woahrebecca stares at the sunrise. this is fine i'll just pretending it's an unreasonable time for you to be awake too.
@Ariana_idsa i only did the purple i still have to do the roots
@woahrebecca what time is it there
@Ariana_idsa i stayed up watching bleach. while bleaching my hair.
@Ariana_idsa why did u get home so late that's ur fault
stares at ceiling. why am i still awake.
YESSSSSS I PREORDERED GAMES WIZARDS PLAY!!!!!! I AM SO EXCITED!!!!!
@woahrebecca it's so tru tbh
just shower my gay ass in money and anime figs in three months that's all i want
me: turns 20 years old
me: asks for anime figs for my bday
@woahrebecca excellent my plan is working
@woahrebecca bec will u still be friends with me in three months when i am no longer a carefree young teen but a mature adult of 20
oh god in three months i'll no longer be a teenager i am going to throw up
i have 0 ideas for what i want for my bday this year bc the only stuff i want is like, $400+???? hmmm. i've got like three months tho
i love the aesthetic of the gates to hell in bleach ahhhh
this feels alarming like that one summer before high school where i did nothing but watch anime and eat hot pockets and diet coke
i can't sleep so i'm watching bleach at 5am i honestly hate myself a lot
@woahrebecca just call him padre
i loVE THE BLEACH OPENINGS A LOT
@swaegerjaquezz immediately after i posted that i started another episode of bleach so never mind keep crying over gimmjow
huffs it's 3am i should stop thinking about bleach and go to sleep U TOO @swaegerjaquezz
@swaegerjaquezz *pats ur head* i understand
@swaegerjaquezz are you ok
here's a vine of a puppy to make up for that feelings dump: 
//personal rant over ok i'm done
hopefully i can get even better now that i am finally actively treating the anxiety instead of just trying to beat it without knowing how
and just. idk. i have friends now besides just the internet and more than just 2 ppl to hang out with and i'm happy with that
and i almost never get nervous talking at work now which is awesome!!! even when i mess up i just get a lil worried about it
like, i have friends now that i have talked to first, instead of letting other friends or school push us together. for like the first time??
tbh i'm pretty proud of the advances i've made to overcome my social anxiety over the past few years, especially since it's been untreated
@swaegerjaquezz i'm gonna finally go the distance this time. if i could watch 400 episodes of naruto in one summer at 13 i can do this now
@swaegerjaquezz i must have stopped like right before him then??? i don't remember it's been like 3 years
@swaegerjaquezz i live for aus. yeah that arc just. holy shit is that arc fucking bad.
the fic was written in 2006 i wonder how much the updates have fucked up the headcanons in it since then
@swaegerjaquezz the farthest i ever got was maybe a few episodes bas bountos?
@swaegerjaquezz i still haven't gotten that far in bleach i just started rewatching it today lmao
@swaegerjaquezz it's ichigo/renji tho so i'm like. do i want to go down that rabbit hole again.
@swaegerjaquezz no lmao it's technically 3 fics? but they're the same verse so.
am i really about to reread 250k+ words of bleach fanfic for the second time. am i really.
the beached parts of my hair are getting crunchy as they dry noooooo
my friends are so pretty!!!!!!! luv all my friends y'all are all so pretty
i can't find the entire bag of smartpop i thought i had in my room wtf
@woahrebecca thank u i'm squatting next to a sea bass we're homies
a fic that was finished this month has a warning for lemons. i forgot ff was still permanently stuck in 2008.
gets rushed to hospital with alcohol poisoning within an hour
time to take a shot every time levy gets called a bluenette in fic
1.1k gajevy fics on 
how are there 6k bleach fics but only like 1k are for ships
i can't decide if i should cosplay orihime or rukia. who would i look better as?????
maybe i'll stay blond for a few days before i go lilac? i haven't done blonde yet......
Progress for tonight!!! Will finish tomorrow bc tired <SLEEPING SYMBOL><SLEEPING SYMBOL> 
it's already midnight.....i think i'll finish my hair tomorrow i'm kinda getting tired
my hair is fucking translucent jfc
*holds hair in my hands* i'm so sorry i treat you this way, please forgive me and stay attached to my head
rip my poor hair
huff ok, time to wash out conditioner, dry my hair, then bleach part dos
vibrates by the end of the weekend  i will finally have pastel purple hair
@tastynomnoms oh my gOD yeah. she was creepy tho.
watch me declare all your fave wifus gay
@tastynomnoms *shoves in lesbians at every opportunity*
@tastynomnoms oooo i think i can see that? tatsuki/orihime tho
orihime is too fucking good for ichigo like he doesn't deserve her honestly
stage one of bleaching my hair is done. time to watch another episode of bleach while i deep condition and then do my roots
@tastynomnoms probably
my last retweet i'm gonna fucking die
@swaegerjaquezz I HATE MY 13 Y/O SELF FOR NOT UNDERSTANDING HOW GREAT THEY ARE
i see u faving my bleach tweets @swaegerjaquezz r u happy u caused this
rukia and orihime are so fucking amazing?????? and strong?????????? how did i ever not worship them and everything they are
watching bleach now that i've gotten rid of most of my internalized misogyny is so fucking nice i no longer hate all the girls for no reason
it's been 7 years and i still love kurosaki ichigo
i'm so sorry 2008 fandom's hatred of women made me ever feel anything but love for you rukia
i missed bleach openings, they're so good
why is bleach 400 episodes holy shit
and then cosplay yamamoto
i guess if it does fall out i'll just finally shave it into a mohawk
everyone pray my hair doesn't fall out bc i'm about to bleach over the bleached parts thanks
fuck it i don't work for a solid week i'm just gonna bleach my hair now i give in
i am taking baking requests for fanime. no guarantee i will make them all but i am taking requests.
@vriskybusiness YES MY DARLING what do you want????
i can't take my icon seriously i need to change it
#thirsty 
@emococksucker i know lmao. i get free tickets tho so i'm still going
@emococksucker i misS U are you going to warped???
*brings three cakes with me to fanime bc i stress bake*
bleh i want an excuse to bake again.......someone let me bake for you
me: i'm hungry
me: watched ppl make food for three hours straight on youtube
@thetulgey_wood @pelicantpark it's so unnecessary??? like who wears stilettos and spandex booty shorts to commit crimes like really
makes bailey's ringtone careless whisper, but the seether version bc i respect that she's xHxCx
@pelicantpark i love the seether version like straight up
@pelicantpark it's so weird for her i hate it and i don't even read comics????
i am unsure why bailey's hatred for careless whisper is so funny to me yet it is
like i've spent a year streamlining and working on how i run my shoots and when ppl just....don't read what i say and ignore i'm so :\\\
like....i get this is your first time booking a shoot with someone and that's cool!!! but like...ugh
when ppl don't read correctly during like....business transactions it annoys me more than i should maybe?
huffs i gotta wash my hair with dish soap one more time and then it should be light enough to bleach white without it breaking off
@tohruoikawa play her carless whisper if u really wanna annoy her
*buys fifteen love live cosplays off taobao* ok i'm good to go for the next 5 cons
@takisiski YESSSSSS i am excited!!!!!
@blueskynoises or a dorito flavor? like, cool ranch, nacho cheese, cool snart
@blueskynoises cool snart sounds like it should be a condiment
@blueskynoises i fucked up oh my god. fuckin. camo. i'm gonna leave now.
why is harley quinn wearing basically only panties for pants in the suicide squad thing. who just. casually wears that. no one.
@blueskynoises did you get it as the event card?
@blueskynoises like my new icon
"trips and a thousand pics of bokuaka fall out of my pockets" same
@takisiski yeah!!!!!!!!! i am excITED if ur down for me to take them!!!! here's my flickr if u wanna see my stuff? 
@earthboun GOD those were something else. i'm so glad those died
@earthboun WARNING yaoi lemon ahead!!!! don't like don't read no flames plz!!!!!!!!
I've done nothing to deserve this 
@tastynomnoms *puts head in hands* they were dark times
@emococksucker i'm so glad i apparently missed those words. i did see 'sessiest' being used tho
i'm so glad we as people have all moved on from using the word smexy
there's only 177 complete gajevy fics on ao3......this is fine....
i really need to stop saying 'fuck my entire ass' in response to bad things happening
i found another japanese cooking channel on youtube oh hell yes
oh....it's 7pm.........i should probably eat today
i should make an instagram post about my fanime photo shoots probably
i really wanna cosplay the girl from ore monogatari but i'm worried that my resting bitch face is too strong
@takisiski UR SO CUTE WTF I AM VERY EXCITED TO TAKE PICTURES OF U AT FANIME!!
especially since....bras in my size are always ugly or like.....hot pink cheeta print
@pelicantpark are you busy next week
ugh i've been reminded that i only own one bra that fits properly and i have the money to get another one it's just such a chore
@swaegerjaquezz i'm 100% sure it's cheaper to get all the materials needed for human transmutation than to buy a bra
WHERE BRAS /WEREN'T/ COST EQUIVALENT TO HUMAN TRANSMUTATION...
when i post pictures of my nozomi cosplay the caption is just gonna be "big titties big butt too"
i just got a cancelation notice for a concert i never bought tickets to? what the fuck
marina is so hot i'm so gay holy shit
the real question is would gaara wear those gross goth clothes from hot topic
@tastynomnoms lets not talk about that
@tastynomnoms this child is disgusting
@tastynomnoms it would have to be wrapped around the outside of the shoe then oh my god. he's so gross oh my god.
gaara is a disgusting emo boy and i love him
fuck i need to rewatch naruto
@theaugustusrex more money*
@theaugustusrex once i get more more............i shall start

@takisiski ahh u guys are gonna look so cute!!!!!
@takisiski you look so cute!!!! are you doing a whole group?
@Ariana_idsa he has very defined highlights on his chest/abs it's weird
i'm honestly not ready for ariana to get home and cry over the body pillow like when did we reach this point in our lives
I had to stuff a second pillow in the pillow case bc sebastian was too small for sousuke lmao
Covers up @Ariana_idsa 's old shame with their new shame 
@pelicantpark like max $20 for all the fabric for it??? idk how much i need tho.....however much you think + like half a yard
@pelicantpark 
@pelicantpark if u see the fabric for pj nozomi and can get all of it for like....$10.....can u buy it for me i'll pay u back
time to cover up sebastian's yaoi hands
@Ariana_idsa i'm putting him on sebastian. hides one shame with another.
@Ariana_idsa can i open it???
@Ariana_idsa wow....wonder what this is..... 
I should probably go back to school and finish my degree but.....I don't.........want to...
This sweater is really important to me 
@Ariana_idsa what if i open it and send u pictures
like....it's not hard to make sure all the pages are oriented correctly please just. it takes five seconds.
whoever formatted the PDF for this zine didn't rotate the landscape pages do u even know how to format please
my mom apparently called bailey to tell her it's her birthday this week mOTHER
@ActualHetaTrash 
ariana and i watched the brony documentary and now we've made plans to watch a jesus camp documentary. i'm excited. shitty docs night.
@Ariana_idsa excellent
@Ariana_idsa can we watch the jesus camp documentary this week
i'm kinda tempted to let the roots grow out enough so i have fresh hair to bleach? but that would take like 4 more months ew
my hair did not want to straighten nicely today i'm so annoyed with it
Uses cat as a mirror stand 
@ActualHetaTrash @theaugustusrex rip
@theaugustusrex i think the DMV makes you look shitty on purpose
when i first showed my dad my ID he laughed and said at least if a cop ever asks if i'm high i can say no that's just my face
@theaugustusrex tru but like, still, i want a chance to have one where i look hopefully less stoned
i hope i can retake my picture when i renew my drivers license next year bc i look stoned in my current one
@emococksucker they win in your heart tho
@emococksucker TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST REBLOG AND MESSAGE ME UR BANK ACCOUNT INFO!!!
remember when ppl actually thought someone was gonna give away a macbook for free via tumblr
@tastynomnoms kei why.
love live crashed right after i started an expert score match i'm gonna throw my phone
bloodborne is pretty in that generic victorian gothic with gratuitous blood/gore way
I'm doing two homestuck shoots at fanime, incredible. Even when I don't cosplay it i can't escape the grey paint.
i love alice in wonderland anything so much sobs
@thetulgey_wood @theaugustusrex take pictures for me pls
actually. i should put up my prints today. i literally have not put up a single print i've bought since AX 2013.
ariana's room and mine look so different bc it's like. i never took down my band trash and they never got to put up their band trash.
@thetulgey_wood u missed the like  10 minute convo about disneyland lmao
buys an aquarium of the pacific pass instead of a dland pass bc aquarium passes are only $55
i literally only ever go to disneyland when a friend can get me in for free lmao i am too cheap for dland
@theaugustusrex well shit now i have to go this year
refuses to go back to disneyland until they put the alice in wonderland rave back up
you literally cannot take ariana anywhere bc they have no sense of shame. none. they regret nothing until they hit on cute girls THEN regret
ok. it's been two days. i either need to wash my hair again or straighten it i can't keep looking like a trollz doll reject
@pelicantpark i still have the light up cube from the drink from that night ahhh
@earthboun rip bailey's knee gradnight2k13
@vriskybusiness rude wtf
I vaguely remember it being $60 for one dinner tho so like. that sure as fuck isn't happening for a while.
sobs one day i will be rich enough to go to disneyland and eat at blue bayou again....one day
@woahrebecca yes!!!!!!! blows u all the kisses
@theaugustusrex @tastynomnoms it be $$$$$$
#socalstruggle

@thetulgey_wood like he'd bring out all his bad traits bc tsukki is.....lbr a douche
@thetulgey_wood i want tsukki kept far away from kuroo bc i feel like tsukki would just make him into an asshole????
@thetulgey_wood i just started thinking about kuroo/kenma/bokuto/akaashi and i am about to purchase a ticket to this ship
"this canadian beauty is legal when did this happen hold up" ARIANA

My hair is something else RN hoo boy 
@thetulgey_wood i'd take it but my hair grows too fast already i don't want to have to buzz the sides weekly
honestly i'm proud of myself for lasting 4 years without shaving all my hair off in a fit of rage
@thetulgey_wood tfw job issues. do it 4 disney. also biotin supposedly helps hair grow faster!!
@thetulgey_wood i've literally never had my hair past my shoulders so when ppl ask for hair stuff i'm just *shrug* i shaved mine to avoid it
@thetulgey_wood squints. i've had my hair shaved for like, 4 years, i am out of ideas then. u prob just have to tough it out.
@thetulgey_wood ; ; are you allowed to wear hair bows and stuff? you could pin your hair back!!!
HOLY SHIT

"I'm a 28yo bi curious guy looking for some soft bro fun"
Kuroo's thighs are the only seat I need
Ok I'm done talking about Levy. Probably. For now.
like god damn, she rewrites spells outside of her magic type on the fly??? She cheats and teases and jokes around as much as FT does???
Just gets really defensive when ppl insult Levy and call her weak and boring like???? She was picked to be an s-class mage like???
It's tagged #same this is amazing
A porn blog that follows me just reblogged a haikyuu gifset from me. Incredible.
Writes a follow up paper about gajeel's character arc and how he isn't excused for his past but he's changed and is making up for it
Goes on an essay long rant about how amazing levy is and even if she's not the strongest she's an amazing mage and deserves the world
Granted I did drop it in a bowl of ramen one time but. It's fine I'm pretty sure that didn't affect it at all.
I've had my phone for over three years tho and all that's happened to it is the battery dying naturally so I'm pretty proud of that
My phone is consistently dying at 50% battery now. I really don't need this I don't have money for a new phone.
So that pun isn't wasted on you all my dogs name is James Bond
If my dog doesn't shut the fuck up I'm sending him to Russia with love
"ok but" 
"i dont like the sound of this"
why did my doorbell just ring no go away i'm not answering it
audrey: "ok but consider this"
me: "i hate you fuck off yes it's perfect"
what's sad is i get so few hours at my job that i am actually excited for that check
MY CHECK TOMORROW IS $100 I'M SO <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
*jazz hands* pay me to take your cosplay pictures at fanime so i can buy merch. fri/sat/mon still open!!! 
@myclue so far i have $55 worth of shoots booked? and another possible $20 but they haven't confirmed yet. that's my food money tho so
lives vicariously through everyone else's AA purchases
like i have enough money for hotel and food and gas just fine, but i have like only $30 to spend in AA cries broken tears
no one let me buy anything at fanime please just take my wallet away. leaves my wallet in the room all 4 days.
i checked my bank account and now i want to die
YELLS OVER HANAYO OH MY GODDDDDD
#小泉花陽生誕祭2015 
the boots and umbrella for that cosplay have sucked all the life out of me and money from my wallet i'm so done with them i hate them

@tohruoikawa ok well yeah then
*looks at unfinished fanime cosplays* *pretends i didn't see it*
@tohruoikawa why did they print out the entire pintrest page
I can't fucking get over this 
Like - I don't even watch yowapedal???? Why would my brain say yes that = mother. Why did I add the -san to it. I'm so confused.
For some reason when I woke up I could not remember the word mother and very firmly thought "yowapedal-san" was what I called my mom????
LRT so me tbh
watching the sun rise brings nothing but a feeling of shame at this point in my life
bokuto and kuroo would eat pot brownies i'm so

@Mantra_Ray judges u from afar

what kind of pjs should i get for nozomi????????? since i'm not gonna wear her actual ones
@pelicantpark ? theyre on my bed rn
tbh i could do that for nozomi too.......but then i'm pretty sure the jacket would not button up
@pelicantpark i'll donate those thigh high socks i have that are as long as i am
if i cosplay the titty girl from nohr i'm stuffing my bra so much you could punch my boobs and i wouldn't even feel it
@thetulgey_wood at least one day she will have padding
i almost spelled suffocate as suffokate bc of the fucking band i'm so
bailey is so cruel to me i need a new best friend
i'm gonna buy all the fabric and just suffocate myself with it. way easier than making the dress.
i'm so glad ariana's cosplay for ruby will be easy besides the arm socks bc i have to resin cast gems and make a ball gown ugh
@pelicantpark #cometobrazil
@pelicantpark squints at u. if you come to corona yes.
@pelicantpark yeah
@thetulgey_wood ok that is. that is very different from tentacle porn.
@thetulgey_wood ok what is it actually before my mind declares that word means squid fucker
@thetulgey_wood I ASSUME THAT IS NOT WHAT U MEANT. BUT. IT WAS THERE.
@thetulgey_wood ok so i'm not hip with the lingo and googled genki and ????

my mom walked into my room and immediately laughed at my hair. thanks.
*stares into the sun* my family is having salad for dinner again
@tohruoikawa same honestly

who wants to do a scott pilgrim versus the world cosplay group w/ me i call dibs on the female ex
my love story is so frickin cute omg i wanna cosplay it ; ;
@Mantra_Ray my life

I LOVE THIS ANIME ALREADY. 10 MINUTES IN AND A DUDE GETS FUCKING WRECKED FOR GROPING A GIRL
after september my free amazon prime membership expires at least i can still use my parents since all i use it for is the shipping anyway
@myclue @tohruoikawa best way to do it tbh
@tohruoikawa i'm also really bad about reminding friends to pay me back so
@tohruoikawa in theory they were supposed to help me pay for the subscription but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@myclue it sucks when i haven't finished the series but they have bc i can't tell where i left off like guys pls
sharing a crunchyroll account with two other ppl means i'll go to watch an anime for the first time and the episodes are already watched smh
pretty sure lootcrate never charged me for my last crate hell yeah
imagine if ray toro and i combined genetics. the kid would have the worst fucking hair, holy shit
I can't stop using #real and it's all @ActualHetaTrash 's fault
when ppl make only one person in a male/male ship a girl so it's now a het ship for fic/art ://////
@theaugustusrex thank u
@ActualHetaTrash also bayblade
"Squad goals: The “Bring It! (Snakes On A Plane)” video by Cobra Starship" @pelicantpark @Ariana_idsa
bailey + her eyebrow nubs = nubley

@pelicantpark if u skype with me really quick i'll show you i'm not sure how to explain it typing
i just misread 'hit his toss' as 'hit his ass' and that's all u need to know about me
@tastynomnoms *holds my 4 pieces of gajevy art and cries*
@tastynomnoms the worst part is you can't even find levy stuff from JP on ebay???/ there is nothing for her. nothing.
@tastynomnoms probably. it keeps my wallet from crying but makes my heart cry so there's no real winner here
@tastynomnoms which is weird considering it's an ecchi anime
or what if i made pastries......i haven't made a lot of pastries you guys can all be my taste testers....
@tastynomnoms yeah it's weird???? even in dealers hall i never see much outside like, happy plushies and wall scrolls tho
there's surprisingly little FT stuff at cons in general considering how popular it is?
i was a terrible babysitter i just sat in the other room the entire time on my phone discussing fanfic with my friends. usually smutty fic.
i laugh when my friends fall in love with side characters with no merch but *clenches fist* levy mcgarden
i have Yoncé / Partition stuck in my head now ahhhh
@swaegerjaquezz ME
@pelicantpark probably
I just really like baking orz
@pelicantpark ok yes I realized this and he's very cute PLS kiss him for me, but, on first out of the corner of my eye glance,
If I make cake/cupcakes right before fanime who would want some?
@pelicantpark while scrolling quickly the thumbnail for this looked like a dick just FYI
It's been seven months since I last dyed my hair I NEED to bleach it this week or I'll shave it off in frustration
Ok time to not throw up for the 40 minutes it takes to pick up my sister
Why does my hair exist 
水族館らしくなったかな？Kuro and Kenma 
You can pry the aux cord out of my cold dead hands
@pelicantpark @Ariana_idsa y'all only have like two hours to control the radio pls
Is this what I get for discussing so my hq porn for the last few days?
Oh my god just fuck me up I stood up and apparently the milkshake is still betraying me
I can't believe fast food milkshakes have betrayed me twice
if i have any followers that actually check the tweets they missed while sleeping i'm so sorry, i shit tweet so much when i'm bored at night
milkshake and strawberry slush was probably not a good mix even tho i barely had any of the slush
Ok so I did actually throw up ugh
i used scented stuff on my face and now i'm shaking and have a headache and want to throw up
anime characters have stupid eyebrows and i hate that i want to shave my brows for cons
can ppl please order some of the bows and flower crowns i have on my etsy store, that would be fantastic, i want them gone thanks
in my defense on never filling taxes, i've never actually made enough money to need to file taxes, so,
i don't want to turn 20 this year i haven't even done by fucking taxes yet i'm not ready ugh
i'll prob tell ariana bc i can trust them not to tell and they probably will stay kinda calm if i ask them to....
i still don't wanna tell anyone i'm watching it tho bc everyone is gonna yell at me :/
@swaegerjaquezz *prays to the titty gods* "pls get me a girl it has been 20 years I think i deserve it by now"
accidentally mashes two different replies into one unintelligible sentence whoops i need to sleep
@swaegerjaquezz ike just. damn. DAMN. girls. *fans self* maybe one day i will have a chance
MY CAT JUST MADE THE CUTEST SNORING NOISES I AM SCREAMING SO LOUD INTERNALLY CAN YOU DIE FROM CUTENESS???
i'm decided i'm not in love with this anime like everyone else seems to be? but it's decent
@swaegerjaquezz they really are just my whole life is sees a girl *will smith pose*
@swaegerjaquezz orz I MEANT THE SECRET TO HOW YOU MANGED TO GET ANY I HECKED UP
@swaegerjaquezz NOT THE NUDES I REALIZED THAT'S WHAT THAT SOUNDED LIKE OMG
@swaegerjaquezz something right, probably, please share
fuck my finger actually really hurts i'm so dumb
cut myself with my x-acto knife ow ; ;
probably not
will my coworkers stop blaming me for shit i don't do just bc they don't like me as a person?
will we ever have more than 350 storewide hours a week again?
will our store hours ever return from war?
i have to make a ball gown, kancolle, love live, and pay for nishinoya *stares into the sun* i only work maybe once a week
my wallet is already crying over ax cosplays
@tohruoikawa same
the ah fandom will never surpass this 
*squints at character* this trash is the fave?
@pelicantpark 
i'd offer to design business cards for my friends but i hate branding so much i don't even wanna do my own
like look how nice this lobby was: 
i'm pretty sure we're staying in the same hotel we did last year which means i'm calling dibs on the fourth floor lobby for photo shoots
@tastynomnoms @pelicantpark i will watch pedal if i get paid
@pelicantpark no
@pelicantpark idk if i'm gonna like it or not and i don't want ppl bugging me about it unless i decide i like it
@pelicantpark

i can't believe the anime i am about to watch. how did my life come to this.
my little sister is turning into a weeb and idk how to handle this
@Mantra_Ray she is god like i hate spiders but. god damn. arachne. fucking QUEEN.

the 5 pound bag is only $17 with free shipping i am seriously considering this
if i buy those sugar free gummy bears will anyone try them with me
@pelicantpark i'm debating if a solid day shitting is worth losing like 5 pounds
@pelicantpark the last review tho 
kinda tempted to get those sugar free gummy bears that apparently make you shit out everything from the past two years as a last second diet
getting a link to a victoria's secret page immediately followed by the name of a male character. good friendship.
@pelicantpark ok
@pelicantpark so we're doing the anaconda video lapdance as nozoeli right
ok but can i take my cat with me to fanime. they probably won't notice.
Eli about Nozomi: "she was sittin down on that big butt but I was still staring at the titties tho"
I MADE MGSELF CRY FUCK
Silhouette by owl city is Kenma and I'm dead inside

"I'm not watching yowapedal" "hmmmm...you would love the second years!!!" "IM NOT WATCHING YOWAPEDAL"
If My Heat Was House by owl city is kuroken as FUCK
I have 3 new cosplays to make for AX and one more to buy *stares directly into the sun* this is fine

@Mantra_Ray I KNOW LIKE HOW DARE
Just Fuck Me Up 
why do the love live artists love bloomers so much they're such a pain in the ass
@takisiski also michael's currently has pretty similar flower garlands for the wig fyi
@takisiski one of my fave outfits of hers tbh the whole fairy tale set is super cute
@myclue some places you have to be 25 but others just 21, but they charge you more if you aren't 25 yet i guess

AX is gonna test my patience bc of several things God damn I'm like done already
i'm trying to get my groove back lmao 
Wakes up for one hour then goes right back to sleep <SLEEPING SYMBOL><SLEEPING SYMBOL>
Hating someone most of your friends love sucks
Does anyone have a cute pj set I can borrow one night of fanime...I need it for a nozoeli shoot but I don't have any cute pjs.
I cover it up with anime and video games but deep down I am still 100% bandom trash
my aesthetic: kuroken fanmixes comprised only of owl city songs
"I don't need my sleeping pills I sleep fine!!!!!" *stays up for 24 hours straight that night*
Squints. It's almost 10am. I've been up for like, 21 hours. I should sleep.

twin atlantic is harder to understand than fall out boy
refuses to think about how there's 7 more kurotsuki fics than kuroken fics
instantly blocks every rando that tries to follow me or tweet at me
considering we had to pay $140 for 3 ppl for a two night hotel stay for ala
only having to pay $133 for a 5 night hotel stay when we only have 3 ppl in the room two nights and 5 for 3 nights is pretty damn good
fanime hotel cost is $45 less than expected *praying hands emoji*
@tastynomnoms :-)
@tastynomnoms did u see what i made: 
@woahrebecca also the VAs for the two main characters are super sweet and i got the female one to watch RWBY at a con

@woahrebecca stop while u can it literally turns into just all the girls (including his cousin) wanting his dick
@tastynomnoms <FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS>

@swaegerjaquezz tbh kenma is the ultimate kuroofucker69 tho so lbr here
@swaegerjaquezz battle to the death. no one really wins bc in the end we are fighting over a fucker69 name
sometimes i see @swaegerjaquezz retweet stuff and get really confused like wtf i didn't RT that and then i remember
god bless ariana
i am a gem to have on skype 
why does michaels close early on sundays i need to buy copics
shoves my face into a tub of vaporub
popcorn is fine to eat while sick right bc i'm eating it
audrey and i while discussing the daisuga royalty au 
katie and i are just slowly dying rip us
i want food and medicine but they're all downstairs and that's just too far
i just realized how badly i need a drawing of kuroo in a garter belt and panties like straight up
how i know the friendship is real 
@vriskybusiness the only way to be sick tbh
@vriskybusiness lays on u and coughs louder
ugh i wonder if i'll have to go to urgentcare ugggghhhhh i think i would rather be sick and miserable
@vriskybusiness how did u get me sick from so far away *shakes fist at u*
TMI////throat hurts slightly less (i can swallow without crying) but i think i'm slowly developing a fever and almost threw up so. no win.
Lays on the bathroom floor bc apparently this is my home now
Hopefully me getting sick now means I won't for fanime
i've worn 18 different cosplays and i'm happy with like 2 of them :/
i miss cosplaying jane only bc she was the only character i felt i looked Really Good as
LALONDES TALKING ABOUT THEIR DRINKING PROBLEMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

casually yiffing aesthetics
i can barely swallow i think i should call out of work
hope y'all are ready to be fucking wrecked by @ActualHetaTrash and my haikyuu!! royalty au
@vriskybusiness god let us both die
90% sure i'm getting sick and i'm supposed to open tomorrow kill me
time to barely use twitter again for a few days until i calm down
ugh i'm just. i'm going to bed i don't want to deal with suddenly not being able to trust a close friend
there are very very very very few things that will make me instantly lose my trust in you but that is 100% one of them and it happened today
but don't you dare fucking tell me you don't drink, go and drink, and then hide it from me and keep telling me to you don't drink
like, drink all you want, that's your choice, as long as you aren't hurting ppl or driving drunk or forcing other ppl to drink i don't care
few things hurt and anger me more than ppl lying to me about whether they've been drinking or not
@swaegerjaquezz tfw no attention span to sit and do nothing but read subtitles for hours at a time
@tohruoikawa levley

@woahrebecca that I would actually be fine with if it was to my photography page
@woahrebecca <PISTOL><HOCHO><BOMB>
Like can you not fucking read??????? Literally just replies with hi email me to discuss this liKE THE POST SAYS.....
When my photo shoot post specifically says EMAIL ME &amp; that I'm doing multiple shoots a day and someone sends me an ask on tumblr about it <UNAMUSED FACE>
Bailey and Ariana letting me DJ for the four hours of the fanime road trip was the worst idea they could have had
Sorry 2 spam this but I rely on ppl booking photo shoots with me to eat at cons so 
I JUST SAW A CAR WITH A "SHREK 03" LICENSE PLATE
YEAH all fixed!!!!! Luckily it was just through the mudflap and just touching the tire, it didn't puncture it
Sits in car eating Taco Bell while waiting for my dad to come change my tire 
I literally can't make turns bc the tire is not held in place by the metal holy shit
Apparently a piece of metal thought it was a good idea to fling itself through the bottom of my car and into my tire 
YEAH mail man came with my umbrella right as I was leaving to go to Bailey's yeaaahhhhhhh perfect timing
who wants to hang out with me in la tomorrow while bailey is at work?
huffs i woke up two hours later than i wanted to today bleh. time to get ready to go to la for cosplay tho.

@0vv0b i might have. made these actual boxer briefs.
i'm so sorry for that picture whoops
Guess what I made based of some Kuroo art I found 
uses a camera deco app to put stickers and sparkles on the pictures of my ass. for cosplay.
I just want to show off these fucking boxers I spent like an hour making them
it's really hard to take pictures of your own ass. things i never planned on discovering bc of cosplay but u know.
@seichans @myclue @pelicantpark @tohruoikawa two kuroo's one Kenma
It's a good thing I lost any shame I had about two years ago

Literally every fuckin time I pick up this cat 
Ok that's it for pictures
My cats hate me So Much 
K-Kuroo-san......

oh my god i'm dying bye everyone
i'm so dizzy i'm gonna pass out and die it was nice knowing you all

How to find my fave character always: the Mage. Multiple mages? Hot mage girl that can kick anyone's ass. Boom. Done.
Uuuuuuugggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh painting isn't making me feel better :(

i've never talked to mike once but i feel like i can trust him just bc i've heard so much about him from other people
Ultimate fanime goal: hook up with hot girl, in or out of cosplay
my only two goals for fanime involve hot girls finding me really hot as well
i want to look so hot as neo that ppl ask me to step on them that is my goal
@theaugustusrex like pls fuck me and then take me to your family bbq like bye
I have accepted that I have a thing for hot dads like it's fine
Gerard is such a hot dad is hurts
@tohruoikawa rip u if he ever cosplays oikawa
@pelicantpark shrug ppl in general tend to ignore me when i cosplay so
even in a group ppl very frequently ask for pictures with them and just ignore me like...oh....ok...........
ugh i just really hate cosplaying alone bc for some reason no one ever notices me unless i'm with a group???? like i just. disappear.
i could just wear Neo two days in a row.....
plus everyone ignored me last time i was kenma??? so. i do not want to wear that alone.
i'd just wear kenma again on sunday but i won't have anyone to wear it with and a lonely kenma is just sad
....maybe just wear espeon again? i'd feel weird wearing it alone tho....
idk what to cosplay sunday of fanime uuggghhhhh
i aspire to have the self confidence of the millionaires
