Update: Alex and Sierra are going to go to every country in Africa and then decide that they want to do a "wedding ceremony" on the moon.
I wish I was on Twitter during Alex and Sierra's X factor but I swear I voted and freaked out from the beginning. I swear on A&amp;S.

I'm so good at losing followers this is fun. I warned you... I'm really annoying.
Everyone in this household is fighting and I'm hiding.
Twitter was dead today. Flop
There should be an X Factor reunion where all the good ones come back let's do it fam.
Ya 
@SwiftlyAWarrior And even if you aren't confident, just know that you should be  because you are absolutely perfect.
@SwiftlyAWarrior But babe you SEEM confident. You posted a picture all about body positivity and your weight loss. It's inspiring to me!!
@SwiftlyAWarrior Have you seen yourself? You're so not fat and you seem so confident and I admire that. They're idiots. You're perfect.
Idk what I'm doing. Idk. It hurts tho. 
@ADDlCTEDEATON Same.
@alextomysierra This isn't smart if you're planning on living.
Just incase you're having a bad day, just remember this picture. Just remember it. 
Why are some vine boys so ignorant jeez.

@saymysierra Idk you as well as a lot of people do, but your smile is so infectious and cute honestly. Sorry if that's weird haha.
@sierraisQUEEN Omg Thank you so much. This means so much to me ily<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@SwiftlyAWarrior It's sad because being skinny is socially acceptable but if you're fat, you're overlooked and "disgusting". Society is sad.
@SwiftlyAWarrior Yes. Ur right.It hurts when being called fat but it's just a body type.Like you don't insult someone by calling them tall.
While we are all talking about being fat and how it's okay, why does it hurt so bad when we get called fat? It shouldn't.
@SwiftlyAWarrior I just tweeted about something like this. I get called fat every day. It sucks.
On Friday we were talking about height and I said that I was 5'6 and this boy said in "length or width" and it's hitting me now. Im kinda :(
Dear fandom, calm down. I'm not a part of any of this but you don't have to make it public. Just honestly calm down. From Erin.
@mainlydeaton She's right. Your weight doesn't have to be a bad thing. Being fat just means that you have fat. You can still be beautiful<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@mainlydeaton I love you too bby<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@mainlydeaton You're getting more beautiful every day this really needs to stop.
WITHOUT THOSE LITTLE THINGS, WE'RE NOT ANYTHINGBSBBANAMAM

I never missed Alex and Sierra more than I do right now. the fact that they may not know how much joy they bring me gives me literal anxiety
Not over these. I still die. 
WAKE UP
I seriously miss A&amp;S so much this is painful.
The fact that idk when I'll hug Alex and Sierra again is terrifying and makes me sad.
WE ARE KNOWN FOR CALLING THEM MOM AND DAD I LOVE THIS. 
I had a dream that I met A&amp;S and I told them about everything that's been going on and they hugged me so tight and made me feel so happy.<TIRED FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️

@addictingdeaton That just shows how many meet and greets I've been too *cough cough* one. But still ITS FRICKEN EXPENSIVE.
WHY IN HELL WOULD I PAY 400$ FOR 3 MINUTES WITH THEM. THATS LITERALLY MY LIFE SAVINGS. IM BROKE.
Dear Alex and Sierra, Get away from Adventures because all they do is make us pay money and they never did anything else anyway.
I'm not bothering with the Reflection tour any more it's so fricken expensive. I'm saving for the hope of an Alex and Sierra tour. I'm broke
IM SO PISSED. I LITERALLY OWN TWO DOLLARS. WHEN HAVE THEY GOTTEN SO FAMOUS. AND WHEN DOES THE NORTH EAST NOT EXSIST.
