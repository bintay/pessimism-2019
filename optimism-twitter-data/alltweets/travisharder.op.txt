If you post spoilers online (even fake ones) just to piss people off, you're not funny, you're just an asshole
@Vodstok yeah, I've never seen any evidence that he's anything but a nice guy
@Vodstok he'd be a little overbearing and probably drive me nuts. But he seems friendly enough
@Vodstok actually, I think it says "these people are totally actors. Also, we're liars"
@staceylking as someone in IT: I hate you. So much
This election has proven one thing, above all: conservatives are VERY sore losers #abvote
@Vodstok Morales would be more interesting, but nobody knows his backstory. Marvel wants to avoid another origin story
@britl I wonder if he's bitter?
It's all: "NDP, NDP, election, random unrelated shit, election, NDP"
It's so weird scrolling through Twitter and seeing the Americans
#abpoli
@FeehanRichard congrats! I'm looking forward to having you as my MLA
NDP! NDP! #OrangeCrush2k15 #abvote2015 #abvote
@TheSoundDefense reading "so you've been publicly shamed" has made me way more reluctant to bitch people out online
@TheSoundDefense also, what did Wheadon say that got him attacked? (Sorry for being behind, somehow)
@TheSoundDefense but I have seen a lot of liberals go way too far in Internet outrage, lately
@TheSoundDefense not "dox and ruin your life" bad, obviously
@TheSoundDefense but once you're "chasing someone off Twitter", that's pretty bad
@TheSoundDefense I mean, branding it all as feminism is very very wrong
@TheSoundDefense not on the Internet it isn't. Also, who's Jonathan Blow and why is he worse than Hitler?
"So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic. And we’ll change the world." - Jack Layton #orangecrush
"My friends, love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair."

Stormtrooper 2: Nah, lets just head back to the Death S…
@typoxia is a coconut considered a fruit?
@Vodstok she didn't pay for her own hotel. You are a much nicer person than I.
I'm stuck on the one with spiders

Fuck it, engraving is free
@CTV_Television Also, can you please advertise something other than CraveTV? Seeing the same ad 20 times in a row is super annoying
@CTV_Television why do your ads on CTVGo load flawlessly, but the TV shows stutter like hell?
@Vodstok you're not terrible! (Am I helping or hurting?)
*Sniff* my little article is four, today. They grow up so fast.... 
And I'm all excited that I got to meet @SWAIM_CORP, @Soren_Ltd, @kawillert, @jack_obrien, @DOB_INC, and @hereinid (2/2)
Everyone is sharing pictures of the celebrities hey got pictures with at @Calgaryexpo (1/2)
@kawillert I watched "Sleeves", after your recommendation. You're right, it's hilarious
The announcer at @Calgaryexpo sounds like @KeithOlbermann. Is this his new job?
@Calgaryexpo so, your booklet mentioned the Cracked panels, but doesn't say where they are....
@TheSoundDefense "oh my god, I'm being censored!" ...what's your point?
@TheSoundDefense private entities CAN censor their works. That's their right
@TheSoundDefense I mean, it is censorship, by definition. The bigger point is that it doesn't matter
@midnight #Bandwiches
@TheSoundDefense if you don't want to support the writer, don't read the article. If you're going to read the article, allow the ads
"Oh, this will surely result in a productive discussion that causes both parties to see each others points of view". Nope
Why do I try engaging with people I disagree with online?
@docfreeride @rocza @shanpalus @manymanywords lets just end this discussion here. Agree to disagree. Live and let live?
@docfreeride @rocza @shanpalus @manymanywords you know what, this is just going to go back and forth until it devolves into personal attacks
@docfreeride @rocza @shanpalus @manymanywords the context of the book didn't matter, that one line, on its own, looked bad.
@docfreeride @rocza @shanpalus @manymanywords I'd argue the attacks against him signalled the same thing.
@docfreeride @rocza @shanpalus @manymanywords on the surface, it just seems like someone looking for a reason to be angry
@docfreeride @rocza @shanpalus @manymanywords the article you link to even explains the nuance and context behind what he wrote.
@docfreeride @rocza @shanpalus @manymanywords he never SAID or meant to imply that being fired is as bad as being raped
@docfreeride @rocza @shanpalus @manymanywords I don't understand why, though. The anger seems predicated behind a false premise
@docfreeride @rocza @shanpalus @manymanywords he wasn't equating rape to being fired.
@docfreeride @rocza @shanpalus @manymanywords at the same time, I don't think he deserved the flack he got for ever writing it.
@docfreeride @rocza @shanpalus @manymanywords I'm not sure what you're trying to say with that. He was right to remove that line.
@rocza I'm sure Jon Roson was just as interested to hear your thoughts :)
@rocza @shanpalus @manymanywords yeah, bad choice of words. That's why he took it out.
@rocza @shanpalus @manymanywords "I don't know if Mercedes is right"
@shanpalus @manymanywords (2/2) after Jon mentioned that attacks against women were more sexual in nature.
@shanpalus @manymanywords it was the 4cahnner who compared being fired to being raped (1/2)
@shanpalus @rocza @manymanywords but he was quoting somebody, not saying it himself.
@jonronson you might find this article interesting. Kind of on a similar track as So You've Been Publicly Shamed: 

(This is my answer if you're ever wondering what I'd do with a superpower.)
@Piddy_X out of context it's incredibly easy to think that's an actual statement
@Piddy_X except lots of GGers ARE harassing women into not speaking out. That's something that actually is happening
@Piddy_X you are no Trevor Noah
@tallertrees #foreveraloneiphone?
@Piddy_X also, what happened to it "being about ethics in journalism?"
@Piddy_X I don't think you know what "anti-harassment" means
@TheSoundDefense not with facts, mind you. Just with LOTS AND LOTS OF CAPS
@TheSoundDefense ah, right. He's the ONE person who can convince me it's not a horrible sexist group
Apparently it's National Siblings Day. So...  Happy National Siblings Day, @cassielynn90!
@TheSoundDefense because there's nothing to discuss. I've said my arguments a million times. I don't need to do it again
@TheSoundDefense I had some GamerGater ramble to me then say "I don't know why you don't want to have a discussion about this"
@TheSoundDefense also: apparently "I don't want to have a political debate right now" means "you are totally right and I can't refute you"
@Vodstok because the bad guy's sysadmins were good enough to block Dropbox, but not good enough to disable USB storage
@jekelish @Vodstok doesn't he just have to win an election?
@CrackedWriters will watching Suits help or hurt my chances?
@Vodstok if it makes you feel better, you could easily kill her new guy and say he was a zombie. Literally nobody would call you on it
@typoxia you mean you DON'T want to watch Preachy Torture Porn(TM)?
@typoxia @Vodstok seriously, send that shit COD, and I'll accept any and all charges. I need my Tim Tam fix
@typoxia @Vodstok you must send me like five of your best Tim Tams
"We care creating a world where the smartest way to survive was to be bland" - probabaly the scariest quote in @jonronson's new book
Apparently I need to at my gift cards more often... 
@TheTweetOfGod @TheSoundDefense meanwhile, MSNBC is airing yet another show about being in prision
@TheTweetOfGod @TheSoundDefense wow, so Fox really will do the opposite of whatever the lamestream media does
@DWKM you meet some interesting people
Hahahahahahahaha 
Why is this still a thing? 
@mattgood what confuses me is when I see it in the window of an apartment in Edmonton. Nowhere even close to The South
@mattgood since there are idiots who might actually say that, my last tweet was sarcastic
@mattgood it's ok, the noose it totally a cultural icon, not a racist symbol....
@tomgara like.. if I got some shitty clickbait site to pay me to troll through your history, I'd find nothing?
@tomgara so... you have a spotless twitter history? You've never said anything offensive or stupid?
@WGladstone Julianne Moore was cut from a Turkey tourism ad for poor acting. She will be replaced by Mel Gibson
@Vodstok @ShroudSciuridae bad analogy. A lot of them DID choose to be uneducated sacks of shit
Jim Norton: Trevor Noah isn't the problem. You are. 
@typoxia that sounded worrisome, until I realized it's probably like 6:30am there, or something.
@typoxia right? I'm sure someone could scroll back a week or two and find something offensive I said
@typoxia Patton Oswalt made a 45 tweet rant defending Noah
@typoxia Trevor Noah (Jon Stewart's replacement) made some inappropriate jokes between 2009 and 2012. People are upset about it
@Vodstok "20 things you won't believe BuzzFeed editor John Smith said in elementary school"
@Vodstok it's like people are actively looking for reasons to be offended, now.
@Vodstok like, why is it as soon as someone reaches a level of prominence, people actively look for dirt on them?
@Vodstok due diligence is one thing, and his "jokes" were stupid and ignorant, but why is this a thing, now?
I'm also a little confused by the fact that somebody went through Trevor Noah's twitter feed, looking for something to be offended about.
Hey guys, someone said something stupid between three and six years ago! Lets get him!
@staceylking does your husband have a two for one deal on redemption?
@DanaSchwartzzz harsh
"Have a Cuervo. Tackle a Christmas tree" - @RealKiefer's next ad, probably.
So @RealKiefer is doing tequila ads. Is that really a good idea? "Have a Cuervo. Have a DUI"
@typoxia please tell me password is ain't nothin to fuck with
@VassyKapelos also, how did she get your name wrong? It's literally two messages up
@VassyKapelos but you used a smilie face and everything!
@typoxia I'M STILL IN MY TWENTIES, GODDAMMIT
@typoxia what's annoying is when I get IDed and the person seems horrified by how old I am
@typoxia #renaming. I don't feel good about that
@typoxia around 2007? Or whenever Twitter became a thing

Future Shop:"...."

Target: "it's not your fault."

*Future Shop bursts into tears* 
@typoxia I think I can relate to this cat
Welcome to the TravisCloud! I can guarantee one 9 uptime!
@dstaples and explain to me how math and science exams bring multiple choice makes sense
@dstaples @sdckg not if you get test anxiety. "Oh, you panic and blank out on tests, you're screwed"
@dstaples explain to me how changing the weighting is "axing the exam"
@dstaples the weighting is being dropped to 30%, but they still exist
@dstaples diploma exams aren't going away. You can still use them to grade the teachers.
@dstaples "well, this probably will be on the exam, so study this stuff"
@dstaples I can tell you that it caused me more anxiety than university or work ever did. It also caused teachers to teach to the test
@dstaples @sdckg tell me, how did you prep for your diploma exam? Was it worth 50% back then?
@dstaples @sdckg "oh, you have test anxiety? Well too bad. Good luck with uni, after this one test dropped your mark 20%"
@dstaples @sdckg because making half of your final grade based on one test is insanity
@sdckg @dstaples or why people think there's this epidemic of bully teachers that fail students arbitrarily
@sdckg @dstaples not sure what suddenly changes in grade 12
@sdckg @dstaples They survived 11 years of their mark being determined that way
@typoxia @Vodstok something about it being "illegal"
@typoxia @Vodstok a coworker went to Australia. He wouldn't bring me back a Quokka...
@edmontonjournal leaving 50% of a mark to one tests hurts students who are bad test takers
@edmontonjournal if they're the best students, they probably did their homework and school exams
@typoxia what about Quokkas? Do you have Quokkas? (I just discovered the Quokka the other day)
"Ketchup is my lube now" - @DWKM
The cops downtown look so confused. I don't think anyone planned this
You ever go to a protest that randomly turns into a march? Or see a march where a random rickshaw shows up?
@KathyBenjamin the Internet has reached peak hipster
@CityofEdmonton so you're shutting down the LRT when there's a major event downtown?!
@Spacekatgal @TheSoundDefense that's fucked up. Hopefully he gets removed from PAX.
.@CityofEdmonton you should probably write yourself a ticket for violating your own bylaws
Way to shovel your sidewalks, @CityofEdmonton 
@TheSoundDefense not much of a movement, then
@TheSoundDefense they know GamerGate is synonymous with sexist and hatred. Why stand behind that if its not what you believe?
@TheSoundDefense if GamerGate was actually about "ethics in journalism" or whatever the fuck the pretend to be about, they'd ditch the name
@Dixon_MC2 what if I don't want to feel dead inside for the next three months?
@DWKM @MJBlaise @Heyasloth @ThoughtOfTyler @PERRY_CHAHAL I thought it was Ernesto?
@WGladstone it's more silly than poignant. I chuckled at is ridiculousness
@typoxia it depends. What's a "beach"?
Jim Prentice kind of reminds me of Frank Underwood. Only... Less trustworthy
@typoxia chocolate is the worst of the three flavours. Vanilla and strawberry all the way
@mattgood just left Vancouver yesterday. I want to go back, already. Bastard
@Vodstok they are both amazing

They look fun. Also, *Emily Blunt*
Late to the game, but rest in peace, Mr. Nimoy.
Can't wait to see @FullyManaged take home the best company award #SBBCAwards
It sounds weird hearing a supposed Canadian emphasize the second t in Toronto.
Dear Law and Order SVU: it's "Torono" and "Calgry" when a Canadian pronounces it.
@TheSoundDefense @theta1138 I hate the gaming "community"
@TheSoundDefense @theta1138 the next step is to say Hearthstone is technically a card game, so it doesn't count, isn't it?
For some reason I watched the Two and a Half Men finale. I want the last hour of my life back
@RockstarJodie again: I really hope things go well with your dad
@RockstarJodie the look on her face gave me a moment of joy
@RockstarJodie she waved super excitedly until she realized I was in the ICU waiting room for a reason
@RockstarJodie when my aunt was sick, I was in the ICU waiting room and saw a friend who was doing a practicum
@Vodstok I got a foot of snow last night. 2 inches and Vancouver shuts down
@Vodstok it's 0 c right now, and I consider that balmy. They bitch when it gets that cold
@Vodstok I don't want to move to the desert, but I am increasingly tempted to go to Vancouver
@TheSoundDefense I suppose we have 10% the population, but still dumb
@TheSoundDefense t-mobile was rumoured to be looking at Canada, and got smacked down by the CRTC (our FTC)
@TheSoundDefense number might be down to 25 right now, but it's still some bullshit
@TheSoundDefense Telus used to be a crown corporation. So they get to make money off infrastructure paid for by tax payer
@TheSoundDefense there are three media companies in Canada that own pretty much all of TV, cellular, and Internet service
@TheSoundDefense my choices are Telus and Shaw. New companies legally can't open up if they're not at least 50% Canadian owned
@TheSoundDefense mines been hovering around 20, lately. So there's that, I suppose. For about a month, I maxed out at 2
@TheSoundDefense also: I hate the government supported oligopoly that prevents advancement in Canada
@TheSoundDefense I hate you so much
@TheSoundDefense oh, and it never actually hit 100
@TheSoundDefense goddammit. I'm at 100Mbps, and that's the fastest available in my area
Violets are blue 
Some flowers are commies
Others are depressed
.@etnow if your headline story is Kanye West's fashion show, you probably shouldn't comment on the state of modern journalism
I would greatly appreciate any support you can lend. The Hope Mission is a tremendous organization that does a lot of good for our city #yeg
I'm going to tweet this again: On Feb 21, I'm participating in @coldest_night , benefiting The Hope Mission 
@TheSoundDefense pushing back is probably the least bad answer...
@TheSoundDefense I'm a computer guy, not a sociologist.
@TheSoundDefense I don't have a solution, btw. It's a shitty situation
@TheSoundDefense the only problem is, fighting them only makes them push back more...
@TheSoundDefense buuuut they're actually doing damage
@TheSoundDefense if GG wasn't riding the harassment train so hard, the best play WOULD be to ignore them
@TheSoundDefense doesn't make it any less shitty
@TheSoundDefense when your back is to the wall, and your choices are admit your wrong or double down, it's human nature to double down
@britl @philosofreaky what can possibly justify three renditions in one night?
@britl @philosofreaky was he ready to flip tables, or was he enjoying it for some reason?
@TheSoundDefense nobody wants to admin they're the bad guy
@britl @philosofreaky third time tonight or do you just go there a lot and recognize them?
@ThatKevinSmith sorry for your loss
@Kell8031 @VassyKapelos @Dani_DCFan if more people were punished for the lies that led up to the war, I'd be more ok with it
@Kell8031 @VassyKapelos @Dani_DCFan of all the Iraq War lies, his was the least bad, though
Hope Mission does a lot of good for Edmonton, so I'd appreciate anything you can donate. My goal is $250, which would be pretty easy to hit
On Feb 21, I'll be participating in the Coldest Night of the Year 5k walk for the @HopeMission. 
Time for a shameless plug....
@TheSoundDefense @Vodstok no one has a secret identity in MCU. The conflict can't be unmasking secrets that don't exist
@TheSoundDefense @Vodstok agreed. It was dumb in the comics, can't work in the movies
@Vodstok unless... Season three of Agents of Shield, premier starts with a kid being bit by a Spider....
@Vodstok you can't pretend he was around during the Chitari, but how do you skip the origin in that short of time?
@Vodstok so I'm curious how they'll introduce him
@Vodstok there's no way for the Civil War to be an unmasking
And it's tweets like that when I remember that the CEO of my employer follows me on Twitter. So, uh.... Hi boss!
I just read a news story that actually used the phrase "lemon butt plug". It was about Playdough
@britl I want to watch that
@britl did someone just watch John Mulaney's stand up special?
When you can't even say why you oppose vaccines, beyond "Im worried about their health", maybe you should shut up and let the doctors decide
Catching up on Nightly Show, I'm trying really hard to listen respectfully to the anti-vaxxer woman. I can't do it. She's just making me mad
@Vodstok I still get fundraising phone calls from a party I haven't donated to in years
@RockstarJodie hopefully everything turns out of with your dad
@jasonroeder about 82 years, on average
@RockstarJodie !
@TheSoundDefense but, as long as they're doxxing people and harassing women, it's hard to just leave it be
@TheSoundDefense if what they were doing wasn't so bad, I wish we could ignore them and let them fade away
@TheSoundDefense like, does our hatred for them validate their efforts?
@TheSoundDefense there will always be sexists, but I almost wonder if they're just living off being trolls now
@TheSoundDefense what are they trying to prove? It's 50 years too late to try and say men are just better
@TheSoundDefense why hasn't GamerGate died? It was a bullshit "movement" that does nothing to address journalistic ethics.
"Well, I really fucking hate that liar Tom Brady…
Why do I ever read the comments on Reddit?
I can't RT myself? This is bullshit!
Sports ball!
How fucking boring...

Sorry sports fans. It's like watching an action movie with 30 second scenes ever…
And yes, those tweets were inspired by a girl stopping in the middle of the gym to take a duck face selfie
That's a level of confidence nobody should have
No matter how confident I feel, I will never be "take a selfie in the middle of the gym" confident.
Goddammit, Office 364, quit changing your admin UI.
@crimandcurls break a leg! (Do people say that for court appearances?)
@Vodstok thanks for the reminder. I'm a few episodes behind and need to catch up
@TheSoundDefense remember when people just complained about reboots being reboots? I miss that
"Anakin was a douche. She seriously left her twin babies to fate because her stunt dick was an as…
@Vodstok @AutumnWednesday did you see that awful CG one in theatres?
@Vodstok to be fair, "I have the high ground" is a pretty shitty reason to think you'll win
@Vodstok and uttered an absolute. Right in that sentence.
@Vodstok how abusive must he have been before he "went evil" that his approval mattered that much to her?
@Vodstok it's so codependent that him choking her doesn't kill her. Heart break over the ordeal kills her.
EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!!
@britl does it at least taste good?
@Vodstok I had a coworker kinda do that 
"How was your weekend?"
"My wife told me she doesn't love me and is leaving. How about you?"
Just out for a rip, are ya bud?
ITIL is the most boring thing ever
HE'S NOT CHOCOLATE!
Save the earth. But at what twisty cost?!
If they're going to require you to copy the entire disc to your console, they should at least give you some HDD space
I didn't have to uninstall shit to play something else
Remember when you could just stream console games from the disc,instead of having to install every goddamn game? That was nice
Dear crazy people: could you please stop shooting cops? You're just making everything so much worse
@jekelish whatever happened to "it has a bad texture"?
@Vodstok Jennifer Lawrence's version actually feels like a real character
@mrmxy well, it's designed by Zuckerberg, so that's very possible
@mrmxy Facebook does not know tact
@Vodstok we can only hope the last thing he sees if a bag of Skittles
@IGLevine I also spent the last 15 minutes listening to random songs from the game.
@IGLevine Bioshock: Infinite is possibly the best video game I've ever played. No bullshit
@Vodstok it's only a matter of time before he lips off to the wrong person. Hopefully.
@DannyTRS phrasing
Oh, Ray Wise is in this? I'll be he's the villian - Me, watching Agent Carter
@typoxia @Vodstok also, the weather is the only thing trying to kill me here
@typoxia @Vodstok I was born here, so...
@Vodstok @typoxia it's -18c right now. that's an improvement from the -25c we had earlier. I would straight up stab someone for -4 right now
@Vodstok @typoxia -4 C is cold to them.
@Vodstok @typoxia that said, my company has an office in Vancouver, and listening to them talk about weather makes me jealous
@Vodstok @typoxia we get like four months of ok weather.....
@Vodstok @typoxia true winter? That's cute
You ever see someone you would consider a friend post something you actually consider to be evil and immoral on Facebook?
There's already Valentines Day shit in stores.... Why?!
@Vodstok with the awesome restaurants, and weird ingredients. God, I miss cable

@mattgood @Bam_86 does the D20 mean you're going with chaotic neutral? If not, can it mean that? Please?
@britl yeah, one big hit, and now obscurity! I'm like the Internet's version of Vanilla Ice!
@britl welcome to the club 
@britl better than being an Internet one hit wonder :p
@britl "unanonymous" enough to be verified?
@britl also: you're famous enough to be verified?!
@britl ah, makes sense.
@britl isn't there some hippie organic grocery store around there? Or did that shutdown, too?

Is that cruel? Maybe, but he's excelled hurting others so fuck him
One second plumber is bullshit

- New York Police Department
@Vodstok wait, what?! Goddammit, celebrities, I don't expect you to be gods, but can you at least be decent people?
@RepStevenSmith @TimRossComedy this...:this is a joke, right?
@Vodstok damn, you really go all out
@tallertrees thanks. It's almost as good as a real onr
@tallertrees that guy's brother is about to eat it. 
@tallertrees no joke, I'm watching that right now
It's interesting hearing @HowardStern publicly say @SethRogen's salary on his show, then say "we shouldn't be reporting on this"
Netflix... If I ask for "Die Hard", do not, under any circumstances, give me "A Good Day to Die Hard"
So iMessage spam is a thing now?!
Wow, so I just got iMessage spam...
"Let's watch this comedy" - @cassielynn90 first scene is the guys wife cheating on him, followed by his dad dying. Very funny movie
Rogues make shitty healers
If you back into a parking stall, you are a terrible person
I wish I could remember the context for this... 
@Ethelmonster @Vodstok @Str8outta401 @Foxmcloud555 @dongohuber @TheTweetOfGod I feel you're going at this from the wrong angle
@Ethelmonster @Vodstok @Str8outta401 @Foxmcloud555 @dongohuber @TheTweetOfGod I mean, Stalin was. And he killed way more people
@Ethelmonster @Vodstok @Str8outta401 @Foxmcloud555 @dongohuber @TheTweetOfGod ....when do I point out that Hitler wasn't actually atheist?
The role of the loyal opposition isn't to topple the government
"In order to be the opposition leader, you have to want to take down the government" - why Danielle Smith should scare every Albertan
Now that the hack is known to be orchestrated by NK, and is related to threats of terrorism, does that count as an act of war?
@VassyKapelos when Danielle Smith grows up, she wants to be just like Jim Prentice.
Amazing. Even while bending over to the PCs, Smith still decides to trash Redford and Stelmach
@VassyKapelos is it bad that I'm kind of hoping she reflexively starts trashing Prentice, before catching herself?
@VassyKapelos if, you know, he ever starts speaking
And today she does the exact same thing. Crossing the floor to put herself first.
That was Danielle Smith, three weeks ago, when two Wildrose MLAs crossed the floor to the PCs
"They gave up the perks of power to serve Albertans ... because they want to put Albertans first. Today we saw the opposite."
@EvGres @shwood well... Sony had to cancel the release of a multimillion dollar movie, so not really?
@CineplexMovies remember when someone actually shot up a movie theatre over TDKR? How is that less scary than some anonymous idiot?
Apparently an actual shooting is less scary that some anonymous kid on the internet
When someone literally shot up a theatre that was showing "The Dark Knight Rises", movie theatres didn't pull it down.
.@CineplexMovies fucking cowards
.@CineplexMovies The US DHS has found no credible threat. There is no threat to security by showing this movie
.@CineplexMovies I can't believe you're pulling The Interview. That is such cowardice to not show the movie
So.... The Wild Rose is dead
@TELUS any chance of offering 100Mbps internet in the Ermineskin neighbourhood of Edmonton, any time soon?
@typoxia shit, I'd accept that as my method of transport for getting to work
Why is this a thing?! 
Sears: we're like The Bay, only... Sadder and shittier
Pretty sure the one guy shopping with his kids is a coach of some sort. "You guys are doing awesome. Really good focus"

@leolaporte to the beginning, plays for like 8 seconds then just stops(2/2)
@leolaporte the twit app is frustrating, bordering on unusable. Paused an episode I DLed and now when I try to resume it returns(1/2)
I may have gotten a little too excited at seeing Cracked repost my article as #CrackedClassic (
According to TimeHop, it was 40 degrees colder this day five years ago...
@Vodstok third party vendor made it. I've had a lot of ...fun calls with them before
@Vodstok yup. It makes my head hurt
@Vodstok good programmers can be a sysadmin's best friend. Bad programmers: our worst nightmare
@Vodstok one of my clients has a program that has to run on their server as a program. So if someone logs off the server, it breaks
@Vodstok if you ever make your program require local admin access, I will hunt you down
Reading the leaked Sony emails: it's amazing how childish and unprofessional people can be while working on a multi million dollar project.
Reprehensible and evil.
@MachinaVult @Vodstok 22 Jump Street does that literally. Except it actually made me laugh
@MachinaVult @Vodstok metaphorically. Unless I blocked part of it out
@rustyrockets @DailyMailUK so mature. "I have issues with this guy, so I'll use my followers as a personal army"
@mothermother any chance of you guys releasing your cover of Video Games on iTunes? It was amazing
@typoxia @Vodstok shit, this would shame a McDonalds line cook
@Vodstok ....that's fucking blue. Like, a blue steak is bad, that's unsafe
@Vodstok gross. Then again, Canadians eat all burgers well done (actual well done, not this shit)
HOW DO I SAN?!
I love how the government can just decide I made $5000 more than I actually did, and demand I pay tax on that....
....At least the Oilers made it to overtime? Baby steps, right?
@erinmallorylong ditto to when the other person was last active or if they've read your kessage
@VassyKapelos I wonder how far that argument can go? "I'm sorry I killed that guy. I just had a bad day"
@VassyKapelos I've had bad days, too. I've still never beaten the living daylights out of someone....
@Vodstok @TheSoundDefense yeah. If they went from the beginning of time, I'm sure it would be way fucking higher for all of us
@Vodstok @TheSoundDefense Jesus Chris. 169 swears on your profile?! Somehow I only got like 39. I call bullshit on that.
@crimandcurls it's what I would have taken if I wasn't lazy
@crimandcurls because you get to fight for the workers and stand up to the man?
@EpcotCentre no.
@crimandcurls I HAVE SCOURED THE DEPTHS OF TUMBLR FOR YOU!
@crimandcurls 
@crimandcurls I'd like to give you a hug, but alas, Twitter does not seem to have that feature
It's been two years since I quit Superstore and I still can't go grocery shopping without thinking "aww man, I don't want to work tonight"
Also: an old Chinese man blowdrying hair that does not appear to be wet
People I saw at the gym today: the love child of Carrot Top and Steven Tyler, poor man's Dave Grohl, and a pregnant woman in a sports bra
You know a team is bad when the official Facebook page for them starts out with "the goalie did everything he could"
Ok... not going to geek out... Take a deep breath... OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG!!!!

@stlcountypd @JohnDiesattheEn "let's put in more white cops to literally put the black people in chains. That will calm racial tensions"
@stlcountypd @JohnDiesattheEn yes, that's totally the way to calm things down....
@BreakingNews @TheSoundDefense @stlcountypd boy, arresting more people and adding more cops will sure calm things down....

@jekelish @CNN I've seen people looking rougher after a Flaming Lips concert
WE NEED THE MILIT-hold on, that was Edmonton, just because it was Canada Day #Ferguson 
SOME SEND IN THE POL-wait, that was Vancouver, after they lost the Stanley Cup 
@DickSmalley if the situation were reversed, would they have just taken the black guy's word for it? He'd probably stand trial
@DickSmalley Wilson is the one saying Brown went for his gun. There should at least be a trial
.@RussPtacek @JohnDiesattheEn @ksdknews why is that a decision he got to make?!
@DickSmalley approached the situation differently, so the charging didn't happen in the first place?
@DickSmalley OC spray? Taser? Baton?
You know how this whole Ferguson thing could have been avoided? By not killing Mike Brown
@SeanMcElwee @TheSoundDefense did this dude just ask police to kill the President?!
@SeanMcElwee @TheSoundDefense "kill the protesters" and "there's no difference between Obama and the protesters"....
#FergusonDecision
Oops.... That might be why the sweater shrunk 
@Vodstok ouch. That sucks, dude
I love how 22 Jump Street starts out apologizing for the fact that it exists
Interesting... The Shaw speed test "powered by Ookla" says I'm getting 90Mbps down. Ookla's 
"If she doesn't want to press charges, we shouldn't charge the attacker" - a cop on Law and Order: SVU
But don't show a cop who doesn't want to pursue charges because "she doesn't want to press charges" (2/2)
Ok, SVU: I get that you want to show a dialogue on hot button issues.... (1/2)
Oooo "LMZ". So much subtly
"Redchan". Very subtle, Law and Order...
@TheSoundDefense ....my generation is going to be remembered for SIMPLE PLAN?!
"Oh hey, we can't provide the speeds you're paying for now, so we're going to up your price!" 
I'm not even getting the speeds of the Shaw 10 package... @shawhelp
Day 8 of slow Shaw internet... What am I paying for, exactly? @shawhelp
Shaw absolutely has an incentive to prioritize shomi over Netflix
My ISP is launching a Netflix competitor, and owns one of the biggest TV networks in Canada. That is why we need net neutrality
@alextarhini_ @mcuban @stevekovach so TWC has good speeds to a site that is used for speed testing.... Not exactly a real word test
@Shawhelp Can you be a little more specific as to what the issues are? Seems weird that I haven't received a decent speed in quite a while
@Shawhelp so these challenges have been persisting for over a week? Are you ever not experiencing issues in my area?
@Shawhelp most I've gotten this week is 20Mbps down
@Shawhelp ...more node issues? My internet is still crawling, compared to what it's supposed to be (5Mbps down, paying for 100 Mbps down).
Ummm... Vaio? When I'm telling you to shut down, and are unplugged with a low battery, it's probably not the best time to update firmware
Bourbon and root beer is a weird combination. And yet, it sort of works?
I have 52+ hours on my timesheet.... I thought this was supposed to be a short week?!
Love seeing that @CanadianTire's entire twitter feed is them apologizing for shitty service
"There's a whopping 30 people in our store, so we're too fucking busy to help you" -@canadiantire
"We're not going to ever answer the phone until every single person in line is gone" -@CanadianTire, apparently
I have never experienced worse service than the @CanadianTire automotive section. "Let's put you on hold for fifteen minutes than hang up"
That feeling when your flight has changed to a gate on the complete opposite side of the airport
.@Shawhelp "node issues" stops becoming a valid excuse at a certain point
.@shawhelp two nights in a row, my internet speed is crawling? Are you ever going to fix this? 
That awkward moment when your "high speed" internet is slower than dial up
@kylefox @Shawhelp last time this happened, took two months for me to fully resolve
@kylefox @Shawhelp maybe it's time to see what @TELUSsupport has....
@kylefox same here
Umm... @shawhelp @shawinfo, why is my speed hovering around 1% of what I'm paying for? 
Well, no shit 
It's amazing how Rex Murphey can take something I agree with and say it in such a pretentious and douchy way that I want to argue with him.
Me: don't tell me what to doooo
@jekelish I totally forgot about that movie. Why did you remind me?!
Well fucking *duh*.
@voz93z53 @_WeHireYou_ ....spam fail.
@Vodstok people are lazy. The GOP knows this, and feeds on it. The Dems made the mistake of thinking people would research
@Vodstok the GOP knows how to rally voters, and spin the media
@Vodstok it doesn't help that so many Dems acted ashamed of Obama, which made them look weak
@Vodstok keep in mind, the obstructionists did a good job making it look like it was Obama's fault
@Vodstok they don't have a veto proof majority, so at least there's that

@crimandcurls (seriously: shes ruthless. It's great)
@crimandcurls then you should already know it. Also: just intimidate your prof into passing
@crimandcurls are you Mike Ross?
It's such a dangerous thing, to just scare people to get their way. Nobody should have to suffer that kind of fear.
GamerGate leolle: if you aren't trying to intimidate journalists, why are you doxxing them?
Super early to the airport! I could have sworn there was a Timmies around here, somewhere....
@TheSoundDefense if your best defence is that it's not illegal to say it, it's not a good argument
@TheSoundDefense just because you can say something doesn't mean you should
@blaktron US Capitol Building in 1998? Guy open fired and killed two people
@Vodstok ....but we don't actually have a shortage of guns. Also, this kind of thing is super rare.
@Vodstok It feels more like Canada is going "so... this happened" and America is going "OH SHIT! TERROR ATTACKS IN CANADA!"
That said, it's really weird to look at the news in other countries and see the top headline being Canada.
So funny that the US media is sensationalizing an attack in Canada more than the Canadian media.
CBC: "1 gunman shot dead in Parliment Hill attack". CNN: 'Numerous gunmen'. Fox: "Ottawa under siege". Gotta love the US media.
If non-fatal traffic collisions are the best the terrorists can do, we're fine.
They're trying to play off a hit and run in Montreal as a terrorist attack... 
Oh yay, and ear infection. I had forgotten just how much these suck
.@kanyewest @HarleyPlays...what?
@Agonzo1 @Vodstok "I'm going to be a free spirit by saying Democrats and Republicans are identical! Ignoring the major differences"
"you should read this buzz feed article, because Pope Benedict follows them". Twitter is weird
Bread makes you fat?!
@Dixon_MC2 also what does it say when my mind first went "you can't call the teacher a hipster!", before realizing when I was in your class?
@Dixon_MC2 hipster.
This is why people hate oil companies. They can't even do promotions without screwing people over

Starbucks sold me a "Oprah" Chai latte by promising it to be spicier than the regular chai, but it's kind of bland... It's named perfectly
@ThatKevinSmith @tuskthemovie it doesn't help that the release was super limited (did it even get released in Canada?)
.@ThatKevinSmith @tuskthemovie I'll make you a deal. If it starts playing in Edmonton, I'll go see it. But, I'm not flying to the US for it.
@Vodstok the organic sticker is unclear though. Is the drink organic? The bottle? Maybe the sticker is organic?
@Vodstok I dunno. It tastes really good and gets me drunk. So I'm happy

Sorry, feeling …
Oh good, my alcoholic cider is organic
@Vodstok just... google Paul Calandra if you want a laugh
@Vodstok seriously though, the video of the original question dodge is so...bizarre....
@Vodstok So true. The Conservatives in Canada are in the middle of a bribery and corruption scandals in the Senate.....
@Vodstok yup. Lately they've become much more like the US Republicans
@Vodstok that said, his answer was laughably bad: 
@Vodstok this guy was apologizing for giving a shitty answer: 
Why do politicians always have to cry? Just once, I want to see a politician apologize or make a speech without bursting into tears.
"that pill headed loony bird" - a line that was actually uttered in a TV show. In 2014....
@PaulCalandra the question was about Iraq, not Isreal! How about you answer the question about Iraq?
Found this in my dresser. Think I'll still be able to redeem it? 
@epcor power has been out in the heritage area for at least an hour. Any ETA on fixing it?

@Vodstok I feel like that's some kind of uniform violation

I don't see how this isn't excessive force
Edmonton's population in 2001 was 650k. Vancouver's population in 2011 was 2 million. Fergunon's population is 21k.
APCs were not deployed on July 1, 2001 in Edmonton, or on June 15, 2011 in Vancouver. Both of those were uncontested riots
This is not a reasonable reaction to a protest: 
One cop seems to be mocking the protestors ---&gt; 
The town of Ferguson has 21k people in it. Why do their police have military equipment?
Our closest ally is firing on civilians, and using what is essentially a military to silence peaceful protests: 
My twitter feed is an odd mix of the inane celebrity self promotion I expect and the clusterfuck that is Ferguson....

@theta1138 I disagree. TDKR and Man of Steel were both bad movies. The Dark Knight is the last good DC movie I can think of
@theta1138 hey, Christopher Nolan made two good DC movies, so Snyder's second one has to be good! Ignore that the first one sucked
@theta1138 that doesn't mean I have to pretend I'm super excited by it, or think it'll live up to the Marvel movies
@theta1138 eh. I really disliked Man of Steel, and my hopes are pretty low for BvS, but I'll end up watching it opening weekend

My fitbit #Fitstats for 4/22/2014: 6,765 steps and 3.1 miles traveled. 
@KimboTheGeek @feliciaday so your default cosplay is Codex and you haven't met Codex? Crazy!
@KimboTheGeek @feliciaday haven't you met her/gotten a picture with her before?
@Cmdr_Hadfield welcome to Edmonton!
My fitbit #Fitstats for 4/21/2014: 1,193 steps and 0.5 miles traveled. 
@KimboTheGeek @Calgaryexpo basically, appear on a short lived Joss Whedon show, or in a Sam Rami movie
@KimboTheGeek @Calgaryexpo become a geek cult icon?
.@HPCanada that's the most useful an HP printer has ever been
@DWKM ok, that's a little classier. High end gopher hunting
@DWKM bottle or box?
@DWKM you've gone full redneck
Note to self: Never buy an @Ubisoft game again. "Uplay is unavailable, so fuck any chance of playing the game you paid for"
@WordsOfDiana I'd just be happy to not have any more snow
Getting real sick of your shit, snow
Naked and Afraid: Uncensored sure seems pretty censored to me...
@DWKM why does the bag look the same as the bag of soap I bought
@RockstarJodie that's why I'm going to the car show before I actually start car shopping
@edmontonjournal why do patents always think they'll be better teachers than actual teachers?
@edmontonjournal leave it up to he actual experts?
#FF @netsparker, your number one script kiddie tool!
No, that's ok week, just fuck some more shit up. Really, I'm totally cool with it.
@WordsOfDiana they were already on the path to redemption, but this last episode redeemed every wrong this show has ever done
@theta1138 @UPROXX true. It's cool to have, but it's never been the deal maker/breaker for me
@theta1138 @UPROXX it usually ends up becoming a novelty thing. "Ooo, I played this game 15 years ago, time to briefly play it again"
@theta1138 @UPROXX it would be cool and all, but I think people overestimate how much it would be used
@KathyBenjamin statistically speaking, there has to be a limit to how much bullshit can fit in a year, right?
@pattonoswalt @GameOfThrones that's not how you already D&amp;D?
@WordsOfDiana right? I rewatched this weeks episode after watching Cap and I'm surprised by how close the timelines are
Like, they should notice that they've replaced the same part three times in the past four years, and maybe realize they fail at life.
You'd think Canadian Tire would have a saved history of maintenance they've done to my car.
Proof if Scott Pilgrim's Canadian-ness: the American is surprised at how much it's snowing in April
Is it sad that the most Canadian movie I've seen in a while was made by an American company, and directed by a Brit?
@Jacopo_della_Q thanks for the spoilers....dick
@sarahlane you didn't help me with lunch either, so....
@Mutherfurcow change yo password
That that I have any desire to be a mason, I'm just really curious as to what goes on in those meetings
Apparently there's a Freemason's meeting downtown, tonight. I wonder how hard it would be to sneak in
["cleverly" go against it]
April fools!

There, did it for you. Now fuck off.
Happy "The Internet is Completely Useless" Day
So they totally Dexter'd the How I Met Your Mother finale
@thefurlinator furlin, how the hell do you stumble on tweets like that? @macklemore
@rickygervais @ProfBrianCox well of course his Tuesday would be more productive than Monday
@gigashark sweet. I'll have to pick it up. Thanks
And a quick Google search now shows everyone is complaining about the same thing. Turns out the Broadcom chip is slow as hell....
Seriously, reading about the chip Sony put in my laptop, it was cutting edge... in 2011
Of course Sony would put a wifi card from 2011 in their 2013 laptop...
@theta1138 you're preordering something with no guarantee that it'll be made
@KimboTheGeek sleep in a little too late?
@ThoughtOfTyler the feels, man. The feels
@Vodstok not our fault you guys attract the ultra right wing nutjobs
@Vodstok he's yours now, bitches! No take backs!
@Vodstok I was so mad when I realized that
@Vodstok try freaking out because a menu bar won't show up, only to realize you made it that same colour as the background
@Vodstok that's kind of impressive
@Vodstok that seems like a tough part to play down. Either way, I doubt I'll watch it
@Vodstok I'm curious how a movie about a man listening to god can be too secular
@tomclarktv @VassyKapelos @TheWestBlock can... Can they nominate someone with the notwithstanding clause?
@thefurlinator you....you might want to swipe left on that
@DWKM win!
One year ago tomorrow we had a blizzard that caused a 100 car pile up. It always snows in March
So.... People didn't really think we were done with snow, did they?
@VassyKapelos called it
Called it
@VassyKapelos kicking people out of the caucus would be like rearranging the deck chairs on the titantic
@VassyKapelos doubt it'll be an election. She'd lose too badly. I'm guessing she's going to resign
@Vodstok @jekelish "woah, I had no idea about the meltdown. I thought it was a football thing"
@cassielynn90 you monster
@TheSoundDefense @EephusLeague does it contain anything, or does it just say "good fucking luck"?
@TheSoundDefense @CNN looks like Ukraine is gonna be part of Russia again....
@TheSoundDefense was that the muppet fighting ring video?
@Vodstok I just hope he feels the pain he caused others, and his family has to deal with mass protests at his funeral
@amandalynferri careful. Those impulse buys add up fast
Voice chat is easily the worst feature of any online game
@TheSoundDefense @damnyouwillis that was painful to read
.@WGladstone we forgave Bryan Cranston for Rock of Ages and Total Recall and he made those while Breaking Bad was still on
@DWKM which bar?
@JFSargent I would have thought you'd be used to writing lists by now?
I also wonder how long it will take for people to realize that we can't just trade away our problems.
Huh, the Oilers lost. I wonder which player we should blame this time...
@DWKM because the government hasn't learned about scan to email, yet.
@DWKM because it's 2014, and nobody uses faxes, anymore?
How do you end up engineering a network infrastructure if you don't understand what DFSR is, or that DHCP != routing?
Reading /r/sysadmin makes me depressed. There are people with no knowledge at all with jobs far more senior than mine.
@luketadams @wilw at least when Galifianikis is disrespectful to the President, we know it's a joke
@WGladstone no. Did you?
@DWKM @tallertrees that's still not "seven goals in a period" embarrassing
@DWKM @tallertrees also, not blowing a massive lead so badly
@DWKM @tallertrees at least the number of cups the leafs have own is greater than 0
@DWKM @tallertrees is there anything that can make the Canucks game look better?
@KimboTheGeek "hmm... I could miss work, but I don't want to use the sick day..."
Dammit man, I'm a SysAdmin, not an X-Ray technician
@KimboTheGeek I've been repeating "it's just allergies" for the past three days. Guess what? #totallynotallergies
@CuzICantStop I don't understand what you're getting at. Some people will always have to drive  Lrt and buses don't work for everybody
@DaRealestTonyC @doniveson I don't know about you, but I see a lot of construction during the summer
@DaRealestTonyC @doniveson winter kills our roads. How do you prevent that?
@DaRealestTonyC @doniveson it's Edmonton. Pot holes are a fact of life. There's only so much you can do
.@DavidUzumeri @DWKM somewhere, someone said "this is a good idea"
@rajskub key word: try
Can we all agree that Daylight Savings Time is garbage?
Apparently Blizzard doesn't want me to play video games, today
"I think I'll play some StarCraft"
StarCraft II must be optimized first.
"Ok... I'll play Diablo!"
Diablo III must be optimized first.
"This origin integration sure makes everything better" - nobody ever @ea
Origin is the worst part of Need for Speed Rivals @EA
@TheSoundDefense I guess it's a "collect them all" sort of thing
@TheSoundDefense huh. The one I bought says "the civil war had nothing to so with slavery"
So.... Why can't OSX use PCL print drivers? Alternatively, why doesn't this printer have a PS driver?
@staceylking I made myself a relatively decent supper, then followed it up with eating leftover pizza at 10pm. Adulthood is hard
I don't know what would be worse: being traded for a draft pick, or finding out the GM hated the deal but made it anyways
@donttrythis for herding cats: put a big empty box in the corral spot. Mission accomplished.

@KathyBenjamin @TheSoundDefense gravity is a much better movie than Avatar, but so was the avengers. Doesn't make it an oscar winner
@TheSoundDefense @KathyBenjamin lifeboat but dragged, but the post-rescue made up for it
@KathyBenjamin @TheSoundDefense is it a legit win, or white guilt win?
@KathyBenjamin @TheSoundDefense I imagkne that will change when I see the rest
@KathyBenjamin @TheSoundDefense Haven't seen 12 years, hustle, or Dallas yet. Of the ones I've seen, I'd vote Phillips
@TheSoundDefense it deserved the technical awards. Doesn't deserve best picture, though
@Gawker @AndyRichter I never asked for this!
@DWKM that actually makes it even more frightening
@DWKM you were frighteningly quick with that response. I can only assume you have that bookmarked
Seriously, put the 38 length jeans up top, and 30 at the bottom
Why are jeans stacked shortest to tallest? If I'm a 30 length, I probably can't reach the top shelf.
@KathyBenjamin I was nine
@KathyBenjamin I hope to one day have enough money to buy a Ferarri... I think I'd use it to buy an old Mustang, instead
I'm cramming for a test that I should have been studying for weeks ago. Strange, I could have sworn I graduated college two years ago...

Olympic hockey: the only time I can be in a bar at 4:30am and not "have a drinking problem"
Awake at 4am to watch a hockey game. This is one of the most Canadian things I've done in a while #WeAreWinter #TrueNorthStrongAndFree
It's 4am and I haven't slept yet. I regret every life decision that led to this moment
@ryan it's PG. It's not like he took him to the original robocop
@britl hmm.... What kind of brooms? Like, wooden handle, or swiffer? I think I could handle being hit with a swiffer
How has Twitch Plays Pokemon made any progress at all?!
Two or three hours in and Twitch Plays Pokemon is still in the same spot. This must be what madness feels like
Dear Microsoft: nobody wants the Bing Bar
@britl so what you're saying is now ISN'T a good time to ask for your sister's number? (Total joke, btw)
@britl I'm assuming his attempt was unsuccessful
@britl "OMG, I've met your sister. Let's date!" Type of thing?
@KathyBenjamin that's just sick, Kathy
@JohnDiesattheEn at least you have people to weed out "3 things I didn't know about butts", now
I should go to bed. But I'm still not caught up on House of Cards....
@EternalCMO @boriskourt if he did it to increase his bonus, you'd have no issues with me criticizing him
@EternalCMO @boriskourt I'm not the one who put 100 out if a job because I was bored of making AAA titles
@KimboTheGeek cool. You have a budget in mind?
@frkbmb @TheSoundDefense I think the more important thing is that number should really be 100%
@frkbmb @TheSoundDefense wait, poor people have (likely landlord provided) appliances? OUTRAGE!
@KimboTheGeek that's....helpful
@TheSoundDefense sorry, class sizes, not classrooms
@TheSoundDefense I also can't speak for the US, but in Canada, classrooms have just gotten bigger and bigger
@TheSoundDefense I'm hesitant to trust a conservative think tank's report of government spending
@TheSoundDefense or "parents are too busy working three jobs to help their kids"
@TheSoundDefense but it's easier to say "teachers aren't teacher" rather than "schools for even have room for these kids"
@TheSoundDefense but I also don't think the problem, by and large, is bad teachers. Underfunding seems to be much worse
@TheSoundDefense I think there's a debate to be had, for sure. And the unions tend to be their own worst enemy
@TheSoundDefense that sounds pretty socialist ;)
@TheSoundDefense like it or not, their job is to look out for the teachers
@TheSoundDefense they're not. Teachers are. They're the teachers union, not students union
@TheSoundDefense we just have to balance the risks
@TheSoundDefense and you can't pretend that it's unfounded. Especially with the history of the labour movement
@TheSoundDefense it may very well be worth trying. But the possibility for abuse is going to worry the teachers unions
@TheSoundDefense why are we talking like people become teachers to make mad cash?
@TheSoundDefense if that were true, nobody would be a teacher.
@TheSoundDefense I'm not saying merit-based raises are nessesarily bad. I'm just saying there are reason to be cautious
@TheSoundDefense but I never hear anything to back it up beyond "it just makes sense to me"
@TheSoundDefense because as soon as the public sector gets mentioned, it seems like everyone has an idea
@TheSoundDefense honest question: do you have any kind of studies to say merit based raises would change anything, or is it a gut feeling?
@TheSoundDefense while giving the cheaper workers more.
@TheSoundDefense when I had a union job, it was common for the managers to try and give the higher paid people as few hours as possible
@TheSoundDefense I wouldn't call it paranoia. That happens a lot, especially in places where seniority means something
@TheSoundDefense they could give teachers with tenure shitty reviews to deny raises, though. Constructive dismissal them out
@TheSoundDefense because they don't like you, or they would rather give it elsewhere (2/2)
@TheSoundDefense for the most part, good job and bad job are subjective. There are bosses that will claim you do a bad job (1/2)
@TheSoundDefense there's also the argument that seniority based raises don't disincentivize doing a good job
@TheSoundDefense basically, the same reason every union opposes anything other than seniority based pay
@TheSoundDefense I think the fear is that it opens the door to pay being sacrificed for political reasons, as well as favouritism
@IGLevine @boriskourt of course. You're not the one out of a job
@Diablo @BlizzardCS I reset my password and added the BattleNet authenticator. Account's still banned, though :(
I have no intention of playing Diablo III any time soon, but I'm a little annoyed that the license I paid for is now unusable
Apparently my Diablo III account was banned for cheating. I haven't played Diablo III in over a year. @BlizzardCS @Diablo
@Vodstok not gonna lie, I'm a little bothered that Levine is laying people off because he's bored with making big games
@Vodstok @thecoppergirl nooooooooo!
Really, I probably use "food" more than "good"
Dear iPhone: I occasionally use the word "food". Please stop autocorrecting it to "good".

@AndyRichter and what's a bigger contraceptive than having a model train collection?
Well... Shit. RIP Phillip Seymour Hoffman 
"We are experiencing minor technical difficulties" is not something you should hear from the speaker in A FUCKING ELEVATOR
@LaReineDesLames yes, but if you can handle a hurricane. You can handle two inches of snow
@LaReineDesLames but you follow that up with "we can't drive in slippery roads"
@LaReineDesLames that's the disconnect I'm getting. You keep taking about all the rain you get.
@LaReineDesLames aren't the roads unusually slick when it rains?
@LaReineDesLames it's honestly no different than driving in rain. Supposedly that part of the country is used to heavy rain
@LaReineDesLames like, so minor that people wouldn't even mention it at work? So minor that you'd forget about it the next day
@LaReineDesLames I'll put it this way: what very minor weather condition would shut down Edmonton, do you think?
@LaReineDesLames what infrastructure do you have to deal with minor rainfalls?
@LaReineDesLames I'm sorry, but the volume was so small I don't see how anything would really need to change?
@LaReineDesLames honestly, what was there to deal with for it? Drive slow, it'll melt within a day. It's not like you need to plow it
@LaReineDesLames an entire major city shut down and people camping in stores over two inches of rain? (Total precip, not accumulation)
@LaReineDesLames I'll put it this way: if you saw a city grind to a half because they got light rain, wouldn't you find that amusing?
@LaReineDesLames also, we had winds that hit the cat 1 hurricane mark this month. Edmonton didn't shit it's pants
@LaReineDesLames and two inches of snow is seriously viewed as "light snow" or even "flurries"
@LaReineDesLames I'm sorry, but your two inches of snow is NOT the same as us getting a hurricane. It IS an overreaction
@LaReineDesLames I've NEVER gotten out of work because there was too much snow
@LaReineDesLames quite often. Our schools literally don't close due to the weather
@LaReineDesLames just this month, we had winds that reached hurricane force. We get downpours. We've had tornados
@LaReineDesLames maybe my sense of "bad weather" is warped because our temperature swings 60-70 degrees C in a year
@LaReineDesLames two inches of snow is our light rain. Your cat 1 hurricane is our blizzard or "winter storm warning"
@LaReineDesLames I don't think you understand how out of whack your metaphor is
@LaReineDesLames send that tweet to everyone in the south
@LaReineDesLames "this water is frozen. I'll bet it's slippery. I'll drive slower" there, winter driving training complete
@LaReineDesLames two inches of snow is seriously considered a good day
@LaReineDesLames you don't seem to understand that "two inches of snow is nothing" isn't false bravado
@LaReineDesLames and that still compares to a blizzard, not two inches
@LaReineDesLames a blizzard is extreme weather. If you want apples to apples, there you go
@LaReineDesLames once I see "two inches of snow Daryl" on CNN, your analogy will hold up
@LaReineDesLames two inches of snow is not extreme weather. A hurricane is.
@LaReineDesLames if Atlanta had whiteout conditions with 20 inches of snow, I'd understand.  Two? No.
@LaReineDesLames Two inches of snow is not the equivalent of a hurricane. A blizzard, maybe.
@LaReineDesLames you mean like the wind storm we had earlier this month?
@LaReineDesLames even with summer tires, two inches of snow doesn't justify sleeping in a Home Depot
@LaReineDesLames we rarely get +30°c days here. We don't suddenly have sun strokes bringing our city to a halt
@LaReineDesLames it's two inches. You drive slowly and leave room in front of you
Seriously, people were apparently sleeping in their cars. Because of the two inches of snow
Apparently Atlanta shut down after two inches of snow... Or as Edmonton calls it: a clear day.
@britl that said, I literally just went on site to reboot a computer because the user didn't and the tech believed her when she said she did
@britl if it's obvious the person knows what they're doing, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt
@britl trust me, every time I call Shaw it's the same frustration. If I don't know you, I have to cover my ass
@britl I know, I've been there. The problem is, if you break something, it's the tech that gets in shit
@britl only for the user to say "oh... Does it need to be plugged in?"
@britl I can practically guarantee that there's a reason they said that. They probably spent an hour dealing with someone
@britl unless I know the user/until I get to know the user, I have to assume they know nothing
@britl it's annoying, but I can't do my job assuming everybody knows as much as they should
@britl "I restarted my computer and it still doesn't work" 
"Really? Our software says it's been running for two months"
@britl that's because most of our users are stupid.
Pro tip part two: users will lie. If troubleshooting a computer, always reboot. Even if the user said they already rebooted
Pro tip: if anything is broken on your computer, always reboot first. Always
Reading Tony Horton's AMA on Reddit, I realize that I love unhealthy food way too much to ever get into that kind of shape.
@Michael_Flinn @AdamSessler @DankahRisen sorry, you're just wrong
@LaenaAnderson I don't see how there's be a downside?
@WGladstone wait, we're not allowed to like Macklemore, now? Stupid trends!

@GoldAndOrSmith @DWKM pandering: he's doing it wrong
@Vodstok eh, I think it's ok to celebrate a little. Crack a beer or something
@Paulatics @britl even IF the advice were useless, I don't see how it's blaming the victim.
@Paulatics @britl note: I'm talking about relative danger NOT comparing women to children
@Paulatics @britl most child molestations are by family. Does that make stranger danger a dumb thing to teach?
@Paulatics @britl does that make his advice less sound?
@Paulatics @britl that doesn't mean alleys aren't more dangerous than a lit street
@Paulatics @britl I don't think that's what the cop was saying. Of course it's not the victims fault

The traffic lights are out, but the electronic billboard is working fine. Because of course it is
@Vodstok remind me to start spoiling shows for you......
@staceylking like.... How does that work? Do they crush it up and put it in a crack pipe?
@staceylking I was confused until I realized it meant Rockets. Now I'm even more confused
@WordsOfDiana he also missed the Friday song and when people liked Bieber. I'm starting to think he got the better deal

New Yorkers take their pizza seriously. Apparently eating it wrong makes Bill de Blasio unfit to be mayor....

@DWKM jokes on me
@DWKM it's closer to my house. And I figured superstore would take too long with all the people making large purchases
Oh yay, the woman with the large order can't even pay for her order....
The cashiers at Soveys aren't even fast. Say what you want about Superstore, they will scan the shit out of your groceries
Why?! They're the most expensive grocery store. Literally anywhere else would be cheaper
Huh.... Apparently there are people in this world who make large shopping trips at Sobeys
Mo fuggin Whitecourt
@Vodstok though the vehicle thing does suck
@Vodstok I'll just put it this way: if your vehicle does not need a special belayer to prevent the engine from freezing: it's not cold
@Vodstok sorry, every time I see Americans complain about how "cold" it is, I feel perspective is needed
@Vodstok wow.... That sounds almost as bad as when my tire blew out while Edmonton was the COLDEST PLACE ON THE PLANET (-50 f w/ windchill)
@Victor_Lucas this might matter if I could find either console in stock....
@Vodstok @JFSargent fuck. Now it's stuck in my head
Whoever said "if you love something, set it free" was probably just an asshole trying to steal your stuff
@DanaJSchwartz7 you can even feel the tone shift with the names of the movies. "Best Offer"

The love story angle of Halo 4 is really creepy.
@gotasister @nenshi interesting idea. There's be a few kinks to work out, of course, but could be workable
@gotasister @nenshi or split cab fare? Or take the bus? Oh wait, that shuts down before last call
@gotasister @nenshi absolutely people need to be accountable, but we also need to take precautions
@gotasister @nenshi tell that to the family of someone killed by a drunk driver. It's never the drunk ones that die
@gotasister @nenshi I prefer driving, but I don't want to impose that on a friend. So I tend to rely on cabs or transit on NYE
@DWKM stopping service before last call seems bad
@gotasister @nenshi how much red tape is there for a drunk driver fatality?
@gotasister @nenshi that's all the matters, eh? No red tape? So what if free transit saved lives? Too much red tape
@gotasister @nenshi "just use a DD" is a shitty deflection for not providing free late night transit
@gotasister @nenshi who wants to be DD around a bunch of drunk people? Provide alt means of getting home is more realistic
@WGladstone so, you're hoping people quoth The Raven nevermore? *hides*
@Mutherfurcow why were you up at 2am? Also, that tweet woke me up
@jekelish yeah... There's a reason I don't talk to some of my family members
@DWKM yeah. Otherwise, I'm 294 months old, not 24
@jekelish especially since she followed it up with "I can't believe two years ago, he was just a month old"
@jekelish yeah. I can see 18 months. That's a pretty big milestone. Once you hit 2, it seems excessive
She knows birthdays aren't a monthly thing, right?
"I can't believe my baby boy is 25 months old, today" - something someone on my friends list actually said.
@LaReineDesLames I think the best thing is to just bite your tongue. Nothing good will come of pointing it out
@staceylking you're still a Harder. The second resolution just isn't going to happen. Sorry.
Also, it seems to be cheaper than legal sky diving
What I get out of the BASE jumping story is that Edmonton apparently has buildings tall enough to BASE jump off of.

@staceylking ok, I feel a bit better. It's typically a stat here ("optional stat"), but my company decided that the peons had to work
@staceylking wait, so there are Americans getting Boxing Day off, while I have I work? Thanks, Obama.....
The only good thing about working on Boxing Day is there was no traffic at all on my way in. That is literally the ONLY good thing
@JustinRYoung try explaining this to someone non-techy in 2013
@RockstarJodie that.....is a lot of presents

@DWKM huh just about sums it up
Tried to clean the fan in my laptop, broke the keyboard. Tried to fix that, now the trackpad doesn't work, either...
@ThoughtOfTyler fuuuuuu
Worst part is: the fan is still running 100% non stop
So, take apart my laptop to clean it out, since the fan runs full speed non-stop. Put it back together. The keyboard doesn't work, anymore
You have to hand it to him, @SethMacFarlane is the master troll
@staceylking also, see if you can figure out the trigger for them. I know my mom gets migraines almost instantly from MSG
@staceylking pitch blackness, turning off the phone, and sleep
Also, what is this shit?! 
I have a tablet. When I grab my laptop, I want a laptop
Attention Windows laptop makers: I just want a thin, lightweight laptop. I don't want a touchscreen. I don't want a "convertible tablet"
Well.... Shit

Hey @gmail, you know how you automatically sort me email to "help" me out? Yeah... don't do that
@Vodstok I do, and I followed you before the bird obsession
103 st hill, just north of 97 ave is a stand still #yegtraffic
@AnnaKendrick47 is there an autotuned remix of Cups? You must link to it-I mean, bunch of savages in this town....
@Vodstok it's insane. Most people don't hold on to cars as long as these clients hold into computers
@Vodstok in XP's defence, the issue is more that the old-ass hardware it runs on.
@Vodstok me neither. And yet, so many of my clients stick with it
@Dixon_MC2 Doom?
@Vodstok XP was great when it came out.... In 2001. It needs to be put out to pasture. It's more like an old dog with rabies, now
I hate Windows XP....

Having 58% packet loss didn't fucking matter to the idiot I dealt with @ShawInfo
Seriously, "I have this intermittent problem", and they say "well, we fixed it for now" @ShawInfo
If there's a tech support worse than  @ShawInfo, I haven't found it

@TheSoundDefense @omglazerkittens if someone makes a DnD game for it, where the tablet is the DM, I'll buy it
@TheSoundDefense @omglazerkittens also the same reason, funny enough, I have no desire to buy a WiiU
@TheSoundDefense @omglazerkittens vita mem cards could be free and I'd still have no reason to buy one
@TheSoundDefense @omglazerkittens if the vita had games that I actually wanted to play, I'd prob buy their mem cards
@TheSoundDefense @omglazerkittens eh. Nintendo wins the handhelds because to has game(s) that I want to plat
@JohnDiesattheEn man, it's almost like rich people have more money, and this can do and eat more expensive things....
@JFSargent "Mister" sounds like a dirty word, half the time
@Vodstok it's just past it's prime
@Vodstok I'd be more pissed off if I actually watched the show anymore.
@jasmin_yeg so that's why it's backed up all the way to the whitemud?
@johncheese they released "Nickleback's Greatest Hits vol1" so...no
@Vodstok they neglect to mention that the "half breed" is a Canadian/American mix, but eh
@Vodstok he's a "half breed" so that justifies it
@SIBLINGJOINTZ @Russjamesmack @spicjt @rickygervais the burden of proof is on who makes the definitive claim
@SIBLINGJOINTZ @Russjamesmack @spicjt @rickygervais my claim is that I don't believe one exists
@SIBLINGJOINTZ @Russjamesmack @spicjt @rickygervais I make no claim that there 100% isn't a god
@SIBLINGJOINTZ @spicjt @rickygervais that's what gervais has been saying for the past two hours
@SIBLINGJOINTZ @spicjt @rickygervais atheism doesn't definitively say there is no god. It says "I don't believe there is"
@SIBLINGJOINTZ @spicjt @rickygervais and I have to reason to assume there is a god.
@SIBLINGJOINTZ @spicjt @rickygervais it also sounds like you're trying to both have and not have a god. Schrodingers deity
@SIBLINGJOINTZ @spicjt @rickygervais then, as NDT said "god" is an ever receding packet of scientific ignorance that grows smaller every day
@SIBLINGJOINTZ @spicjt @rickygervais so you're playing the god of the gaps card? God is whatever you don't understand?
Ok, people. When backing up, things come from behind you. Maybe it's a good idea to LOOK OUT YOUR BACK WINDOW when in reverse
@DennisCalero they believe, but it is impossible to know. Knowledge and belief are two different things
@DennisCalero some are agnostic Muslims, etc
@DennisCalero exactly Gervais' point. We are all agnostics. Some are agnostic Christians, some agnostic atheists
@DennisCalero @rickygervais a gnostic atheist knows for sure there is no god
@DennisCalero @rickygervais so an agnostic atheist believes there is no god, but doesn't know for sure
@DennisCalero @rickygervais agnostic/gnostic is about knowledge. A gnostic knows, an agnostic doesn't
@rickygervais I think most atheists consider themselves agnostic atheists. Most Christians think we're gnostic atheists, though
@laina622 26°F? That's quite a balmy day

@TheSoundDefense as far as political moves go, this was a pretty dumb one
@TheSoundDefense I don't get how pretending to be surprised was a better move than preemptively saying "so... this is going to have issues"
Somehow, the act of me following people seems to destroy families
If I follow you, and you think your life is going great, then I've got some bad news for you: it's apparently not going to last
So, I've seen at least three different people tweet about their lives falling apart....
@TheSoundDefense call me when you have a politician lie about smoking crack
@LaenaAnderson I don't remember getting home after I had my wisdom teeth yanked. I was sitting in a dentist chair then I woke up on my couch
@SarahYEG I may have to do that. The Nacho ones were ok, though I may still be partial to pep and bacon
@LaenaAnderson the drugs they give you are pretty cool, though
@Snubs @macdoggy2 yes you most certainly are, and you really shouldn't be proud of it
@andersoncooper must you interview him? Hasn't Canada's reputation suffered enough?
So, it took me two hours to get home...

@ABFalecbaldwin @JuanPelo23 so I take it you don't read your own tweets, then?

If we throw away or give up those freedoms, their sacrifice is meaningless. #LestWeForget #RemeberanceDay
It's easy to just say "support our troops", but that support is pointless if we don't remember why we support them.
Lest We Forget shouldn't just be a catchphrase. Remember those that fought and died for our freedoms, but also remember those freedoms

Even in practise, they probably only got like two shots on net

Good job, Dubnyk......

@Vodstok @TheSoundDefense no matter what system you have, specialists make more
@Vodstok @TheSoundDefense that problem isn't only in America. It's a problem pretty much everywhere
@TheSoundDefense our economy should take a hit because America's House GOP are being tools
@TheSoundDefense and when the American economy suffers, so does Canada's.
@TheSoundDefense in order to "protect the economy", at least 200k people are out of a job
@TheSoundDefense when one side acts like a child and refuses to budge, do you just give up?
@TheSoundDefense honestly, the ACA is still better than nothing and was likely the best the Dems would get right now
@TheSoundDefense you can't will doctors into existence, so the only alt is to not insure more people. That's not a solution
@TheSoundDefense no matter what you so, insuring more people will increase demand
@TheSoundDefense and the specific article you linked to can't really be blamed on the ACA
@TheSoundDefense is shutting down the government in opposition a better way?
@TheSoundDefense I know that's not what you're getting at
@TheSoundDefense yeah.... I'm not sure Obamacare can really be blamed when the alternative is "let poor people go without medical coverage"
@JFSargent I'm just glad I got to write "but Cracked, you say" before it was out of style
@Vodstok point taken
"We're on a show our faces breaking the law, but we'll never be arrested. Even by the cop that our camera crew is following"
Either the Sheriff on Moonshiners doesn't watch the show he's on, or it's completely staged
Good bye, Tom Clancy, thanks for writing some of my favourite novels, and inspiring some of my favourite video games

@Vodstok in Canada, if this shit was pulled, a new election would be called
@Vodstok the thing is, they did so by refusing to pass a budget that doesn't include a repeal of the ACA.
It blows me away that a failed budget vote can put the whole US government at a standstill
@hahaitsjoemama @Vodstok health care is a vital component of life
@hahaitsjoemama @Vodstok every man has the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? (2/2)
@hahaitsjoemama @Vodstok it begins and ends at actual human needs. Doesn't your constitution say something along the lines of (1/2)
@hahaitsjoemama @Vodstok that's a HUGE stretch and doesn't make sense as an argument
@Vodstok you fools, when our Parliament fails this hard, we get to have another election
@Vodstok for all it's fault, I know that if I'm sick, I can go to literally any hospital I want and get treatment
@Vodstok BUT I will take that any day over the clusterfuck of US healthcare
@Vodstok the Canadian health care system is far from perfect, and we often do have wait times that are longer than they should be
@hahaitsjoemama @Vodstok Obamacare isn't perfect. Neither is the system we have in Canada. Still beats what you had
@hahaitsjoemama @Vodstok no man is an island and no one should die because they can't afford healthcare

@Vodstok talking to people with kids is great birth control
@Vodstok at least from what I've heard
@Vodstok the issue with calling "parenthood" a job is that it implies you get paid. "Indentured servitude" sounds more realistic
@Vodstok thank you very much. I did have to work a 12 hour day two weeks ago to earn it, but so worth it, now
@Vodstok I forgot it was payday until about 5 minutes ago AND I get to take a half day. This is like Christmas and my Birthday combined.
The more I see Ted Cruz speak, the happier I am that he left Canada
Outlook takes forever to export emails....
@johncusack @BoingBoing and ironically, it'll need Lora of cameras and coverage to succeed
@TheSoundDefense @BarackObama House Republicans haven't been acting rational lately
@TheSoundDefense @BarackObama there's a difference between disagreeing and trying to kill it something like 40 times
.@peta @Vodstok crazy idea, but maybe spend less money on nude rally's and throwing paint at people, and more on, you know, helping animals?
@Vodstok I want to be rich enough that I can say "you know, money really doesn't buy happiness", and actually think it
@Vodstok my boss will, unironically, say "Happy Monday" on Monday mornings, wen I'm still waking up
@Vodstok "oh, we need to bundle the IE7, 8, and 9 rendering engines? Ain't nothing wrong with that"
@Vodstok best part is SharePoint 2010 and older don't work with IE10, unless it's in comparability mode
@Vodstok yeah. The worst is when someone is trying to use SharePoint, because M$ has decided to make it ONLY work with IE
@Vodstok yup. It always kills me when a user is using IE for everything. We install Chrome on every computer for a reason
@Vodstok IE10 is actually a decent browser.... For downloading Chrome
@KimboODell very true
@KimboODell I know... What am I going to watch until Game of Thrones is back?!
@KimboODell well, last nights episode was pretty awesome
@Vodstok then you tell Adobe and Java to suck it
@janejunx @KathyBenjamin if Ozymandeous doesn't win the show all the Emmys, that'll be a tragedy
@KimboODell fair enough, but "Ozymamdaeous" buys the BB writers a lot of faith
@KimboODell the Lost writers aren't Vince motherfucking Gilligan
So apparently Michael doesn't wear seatbelts #gtav
@DWKM yup
@DWKM so far it's fun. But the driving (at least with the first two cars they have you drive) is still sloppy as hell
If you were wondering where they fixed the driving in GTAV, the answer is no. They really did not
Seriously "we'll text you a code" and it never comes
Microsoft: two factor authentication doesn't work when it takes forever for me to get the code
@Vodstok jelly. I'm doing IT at a dental clinic.
@Vodstok eh. Creative storytelling
@Vodstok his text; "this fucker behind me is VINING and driving. Can you believe that shit?"
.@ShaunMunroFilm nah, keep playing GTAV. At least it stops you from stealing work for a while
Apple, I have an idea: put USB ports on the side of iMacs, not the back. It'll make using thumb drives so much easier
Mmmm. Homemade cinnamon bun 
Ummm @EASPORTSNHL @EASPORTS I'm not really thrilled about ads being in a game I paid for
@ThoughtOfTyler out of scope
Why do people like to park in spots that are reserved?
.@ShaunMunroFilm is "GTA V supplies" the street term for ripping off @Cracked?
Train shows up and now it's just stopped on the tracks #yegtraffic
Train arms down at 99 st and 60 ave, but no train... #yegtraffic
@Sidekickcomedy the time between when Breaking Bad airs and when I watch it, I basically have to put my phone in airplane mode
@typoxia I usually say "gesundheit", but occasionally "give your soul to Satan"
.@MensHumor did....did you just have a stroke?
.@Horse_ebooks devastating what, horse ebooks, DEVASTATING WHAT?!
@shwood what's in the box? WHATS IN THE BOX?!?!
