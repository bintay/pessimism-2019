Missing a free throw does not define you as a player. So why judge someone's gender by seeing them do things once only distaffs do?
At the end of the day, the athletes still have the last say about that matter. Pasensyahan na lang kung anong mangyari.
By saying those things you're also (similarly) stating that there won't be better players to come to uplift the sport and the country.
Definitely provoking when there are arguments revolving around self-centered judgments and full hypocrisy.
Are we really talking about Pinoy pride here? Don't you think letting them play in int'l level captures the real image of Pinoy pride?
Want to know how it feels like to be away from home? Ask Coach Tai.
Dragging the name of the country's president IN EVERYTHING is NEVER FUNNY. Have you ever acknowledged all the good things he did for PH?
Your discourse full of bitter condemnation does not help. Neither makes the government pull sponsors for Philippine volleyball.
Let's try to visualize Valdez, Gamova, KYK, Liu making an impact when all of them are on the same side of the court. Deadly.
I don't think there's a libero who's good enough to get KYK's attacks yet.
Seeing KYK's backrow hits will literally drop your jaw. Sobrang kargado. Kahit services niya pwedeng makamatay pag matamaan ka sa mukha.
Yeon-Koung is 27. Alyssa is 21. There's always a possibility that the Phenom can be like KYK in few years time - a goliath inside the court
There are still a lot of rooms for her growth and maturity. She will find her peace of mind and sort things out. Soon. Just wait and see.
I used to be like her. I used to hate my brother. Big time. I thought things will always stay the same. Lucky me, I was wrong.
It's never easy to discipline a wild animal.
I understand you - it's one thing. I value the person you hate, is another. Having the attempt to commit a murder is nonessential.
I really don't have a reliable statement regarding this matter. Let them handle their own misunderstandings. (It's an understatement!)
"Siblings fight." You mean the kind of fight that would last for the rest of their lives? Yeah, that's normal.
You've never seen a prey who was the one that hunted the predator.
Definitely not.  
Happiest birthday to the couple who made a lot of people believe that there is forever <TWO HEARTS> @jumorado10 @_amdeguzman
They're sisters by blood. But everybody can clearly see that their relationship isn't emotionally healthy.  
Let's all take a moment to appraise the current situation.
Is this some kind of a conspiracy joke because hell I don't buy it. To the organizers, we respect your flag. RACISTS 
Enough, guys. Just let it go. We can never fix titanic anymore. #TeamMyla <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> #justkidding
U23 Men's on its way, PH Super Liga Finals, SEA Games, ... Ok I think I need to make more time for these. <WATCH><HAMMER>
Thai coaches are the best!
What's the use of covering every timeout when you can't even understand their huddles <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> GO JAPAN!
These teams are just in a world class kind of level.
It's the game of super humans. Go, Japan! <REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER J + REG><REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER J + REG><REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER J + REG> #KORvsJPN

What a way to end this tournament. Congrats, Team Pilipinas! Thank you for the fight. #PUSO
Magbiro ka na sa lasing wag lang sa Team Pinas na bagong gising <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
One more set for 7th place. #LabanPilipinas
Jiamazing <HEAVY BLACK HEART><BLUE HEART><YELLOW HEART>
Ganda ng reception ng Pilipinas! #LabanPilipinas
This team today is more inspired than ever. #LabanPilipinas
Look at the stat line. Pagod ba talaga kayo? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #LabanPilipinas
Soltones just spent most of her time in the service line during the first set. 1/3. Go, Pilipinas! #LabanPilipinas
Thailand has the heart. China has the ego. #AVCU23
Good luck, Team Pilipinas! Go for 7th. ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ #PUSO
Let's go, Thailand! #AVCU23
CHN is the kind of team who earns respect easily but does not give any. Unless, your team is the weakest and you get to beat them.

Kung kabayo nga napapagod, tayo pa kaya. Yaan na natin, 3 wks pa lang naman tayo mâ€¦

"How can the smaller Filipinos who were assembled only 3 wks ago managed to win a set aâ€¦
Valdez jokingly says: Linesmaâ€¦
He will be back. Head coaches are assigned with contracts. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> but he won't be able to attend trainings if he'd leave 
So even Chinese Taipei wasn't able to win a set from China? This could be a good sign for the PH's upcoming game.
Despite losing to CHN, I know everybody's happy to see the performance of Team PH. I didn't even expect that we'd steal a set from them <THUMBS UP SIGN><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
People should quit this #LabanParaSaSpratlys . The CHN team might take it seriously. Baka mas lalong di maawa sa'tin. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I don't think we're talking about practicality. It's more like your self-centered wills and restraint.
I have nothing against the LS and Wong (she's a great setter <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>). But I think she would fit in DLSU just right because of her mentality.
Hahaha this has to be kidding me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> but wongpong seems to be okay <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> 
Having high expectations would lead us to great disappointments. Just let them play. Winning isn't the goal. Fighting hard is.
Everybody knows what will happen later. It's EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to barge into the Great Wall.
If there are probabilities that she will play for other country, I think that country would be Thailand.
I can't imagine Alyssa playing for Japan with her hair cut short and has full bangs.
They have different fidelities. So let's not push through with our altercations about their tournament in Bora and not joining the AVC U23.
Let's not make our athletes feel like the decisions they made to join the LaBoracay were worthless. It's their decision. Not ours.
I'll be okay if you would say a lot of bad things to me. I don't care. But throwing rants at av will cause you your life. Big time.
People are unbelievably upfront through social networking sites. What if we argue over this in person? Just ugh.
You're ours, Alyssa. Ours alone.
No exaggerations included but EJ Laure might be the next Alyssa Valdez.
No, I'm not unco lovesick nor a hopeless romantic but Jia and Miguel are making me hate being single.
The audience impact won't be enough to turn China down tomorrow. It will be up to the team and their tactics. Let's all hope for the best.
We haven't even secured a spot at U23 yet, tas SEAGames agad? One step at a time tayo mga dre. Unless you guys are just after the players? <SMIRKING FACE>
If KAZ(def. by PH) was able to force a five setter match against IRI(def. PH), I think it's possible to win against Taiwan tomorrow.
The polos aren't the same, guys. Reality check na din. #titanicmode #noimnotprovokingyou
I wonder when will the industry of sports stop producing issues. Oh wait. It wasn't the industry, it was the bashers! Damn right
This is actually way more horrifying and formidable than the kills of Japan earlier at the game. 
To all the bashers of Tin Agno, we would like to see how far you can go. Get in the court and receive the spikes from those Japanese.
Japan has a solid volleyball program. And that's intimidating. Knowing that they're still training is scarier.
Hating Tin Agno is like hating her for her ability to walk on the water. Respeto naman.
Thank you for playing your heart out for the country. You've been fearless out there! I love you, @TinAgno1 <HEAVY BLACK HEART><BLUE HEART><YELLOW HEART>
I think it's time for Coach Gorayeb to get the magic out of his sleeves. Meneses and Laure can give Japan a hard time to read their attacks.
Well at least the rally is good. <THUMBS UP SIGN>
If it's just gonna be offense, Laure can give it to the team. #LabanPilipinas
With Japan's powerful kills, I think it's time to give Ria Meneses the spotlight. Let her play.
We'll be there. If not this day, then soon. Definitely. You don't publish a great book within just three weeks. <THUMBS UP SIGN> #LabanPilipinas
Damn possibilities are I won't be able to watch the game live and go for the livestream if things would continue to go wrong. This sucks.
Please put the electricity back. We're paying our bills without any complains so fck you samelco II if you won't.
Samelco II just cut the electricity without telling people that they would do so. Go to hell. Your services are lame.
I will say ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

If David was able to face Goliath, then we're able to conquer Japan. #LabanPilipinas #ParaSaBayan ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­
Both teams are good. Great job to Thailand and Korea! 
I really don't buy your racism. It's intolerable.
He sure does have issues with liberos.
Playing the video of yesterday's game and listening to every single word that Zarate is saying. This guy is unbelievable.
Nothing deep but I think all liberos are good-looking. Just forgot the name of the KAZ libero
Kazakhstan's libero did nothing but play her heart out for her country. She doesn't deserve a disrespectful treatment.
By saying those things to the libero of KAZ, he's also mortifying the reputation of Philippine volleyball. What an imbecile.
I don't do such things because I'm not a manipulative asshole.
China is one heck of a merciless team. Being the giant in power, height, and speed will bring them to the top in just a snap.
Before earning people's respect, prove them you're worth it. #thiswouldbethelast
We understand how you handle your thoughts. But if you know that people can hear you and you just shrug it off? You're unpredictable, Sir.
Noel Zarate should stop dissing the libero of Team Kazakhstan. He's completely giving the industry a display of humiliation.
Ironic that a Japanese will be playing for the Philippines tomorrow against Japan. I hope Risa Sato will be a part of the starting six. <THUMBS UP SIGN>
Go Western Visayas! <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> #Palaro2015
If beauty would be the main basis, I'd even risk my life as a condition of choosing Kazakhstan. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I hope that Kazakhstan will win today. Facing Japan tomorrow would give our team a hard time to sweep their feet off the ground
@TeamGretchen03 if Iran would win today's game, they'll be facing Japan tomorrow. If Kazakhstan naman, Chinese-Taipei <THUMBS UP SIGN>
I'm okay with Mayweather winning the fight. No bias. You might not see him going with the offense most of the time but the defense was good
I really don't buy calling it the fight of the century. It wasn't really that worth waiting for. Like playing tag inside the ring? Wth
Kazakhstan must be hurt right now with a lot of people misspelling it. What a torture <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #donttakeitseriously
Captain Baldomero will be playing. Yay! #LabanPilipinas
Let's go Team Pilipinas. #PUSO
Laban Team Pilipinas <FISTED HAND SIGN>
Honestly if there's someone to be blamed, it's no one <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> jho, riri, and ej are all playing in different positions. Stop comparing. <THUMBS UP SIGN>
We should really stop the hate. Blaming someone wouldn't help to win today's match. Let's take this fight unitedly. ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ #LabanPilipinas
See what levelheaded people can say?  
Main reason why they don't like Jho. They can't be as good as her. 
If you'd be the one replacing her then why not? Prove yourself that you're better than her in any aspect 
@Alyssa_Valdez2 Sorry i fell asleep <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> what if our players would give each one of them a facial? Like the solid one? I'd like that
@Alyssa_Valdez2 i agree. Not everybody can see it because they're too busy calculating the errors. Konti na lang talaga ang mga matitino
@Alyssa_Valdez2 hahaha <THUMBS UP SIGN><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> i feel sorry for her "wrist injured" statement. Hahaha <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Respecting someone who didn't do anything to harm you isn't hard. In fact respecting someone like you is the hardest
Have you read this? @Alyssa_Valdez2 can't believe people these days 
@Alyssa_Valdez2 yeah. Aren't even they surprised that a first timer can be that good? Excluding the errors, you can see that she's trying.
@Alyssa_Valdez2 continuously picking up the pieces of my broken heart because of the tweets <DISAPPOINTED FACE> jk. Trying to figure out what's with them
Can't you just deal with the fact that it's a team sport? She wasn't the only one who committed mistakes.
I really can't stand people who would keep on saying rude things to someone just to practice "freedom of expression" or "tell the truth"
Don't expect her not to feel anything after reading the tweets. Making her feel small and incapable of doing good things are ruthless.
It's taking Thais to appreciate how good our players are.
@Alyssa_Valdez2 been reading tweets about Jho. Not doing good. What are you doing? <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
People would always understand things with the use of their own point of views.
Don't complicate things that are simple. If you don't like her, fine. Shut up. If you do, then good. You see things clearly
@Alyssa_Valdez2 hiii <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Let. Maraguinot. Go.
Maximize the players for goodness' sake! Meneses and Laure will be a big help to step up to win this set
I don't mean to be rude but if Galang was on the floor and Valdez ain't injured and Manabat is present, Iran's facing a huge powerhouse
PHI
Valdez 24 pts
Santiago 10 pts
Morado 37 excellent sets
IRI
Saberi 13 pts
Kadkhoda 10 pts
Errors: PHI 29, IRâ€¦
I believe all these aces are from our Captain  
Is Alyssa Valdez really injured? If yes, Iran shouldn't wish her to get better by now. What a scoring machine! #LabanPilipinas
The hearts of fighting Filipinos beating louder #LabanPilipinas
Meneses should go inside to increase our net defense and Laure to guide Valdez.
I don't intend to be a racist but Iran's sports attire...
Go for the W. #LabanPilipinas
