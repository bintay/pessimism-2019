@SomethingAbtFtb i dont play idp so its just a guess
@SomethingAbtFtb but thats it
@SomethingAbtFtb i can see it on a bad corner on a bad D who is probably going to making a lot of tackles
@SherwoodStrauss Im pretty sure Atlanta would be down by 16 by this point
@JasonWalkerSBN I know it sucks and all but the Hawks shouldnt have been in that position int he first place vs a walless wizards
@BTRowland No. Buds never increased his minutes when he played well in the regular season, why would he do it now?
@ATLHawks_Reddit ask Bud, whose rotations and lineups have been mostly responsible for the fact the Hawks are playing piss poor ball
@JohnMiddlekauff id prefer this over the garbage subtle "im not really cocky" bullshit he does.
@RealCoachBud what
@peachtreehoops thought he was defending the inbounds
Really dont see a realistic shot in hell that Hawks can win this series
This Hawks team is garbage.
@SomethingAbtFtb I can completely see this
@SomethingAbtFtb Hack? He's a hack. Hes been bad since day one.
@SomethingAbtFtb I think ALL of the projected QBs next year are bad. I mean, Cook for MSU looked just average as hell the last 4-6 games
@SomethingAbtFtb #1 QB in this next class per a lot of really stupid people
@CFBZ Worst team in the playoffs. Including the losers who arent even in the playoffs.
@peachtreehoops @SethPartnow How about defense? Im pretty sure the only team playing worse D than Atlanta is Houston.
@FrontOfficeLos Because im going to
@FrontOfficeLos Can I call in on Monday and fire up chernoff by labeling the Hawks as the worst 60 win, one seed team in NBA history?
@crossoverNBA Hawks/Rockets game might involve 300 total points being scored
@crossoverNBA As a Hawks fan I really have no idea how this team won 60 games, let alone 19 in a row.
@peachtreehoops What is defense? Maybe the Hawks should play a little
What a dumb technical
@crossoverNBA But the Rockets arent fighting for the label of worst one seed, 60 win team in NBA history so.
@crossoverNBA Its not wrong though. Both teams are so bad defensively that its fair to start there
@Kris_Willis The Hawks probably are the worst team offensively in the playoffs
@Kris_Willis @ryan_jones_3 the entire team sucks on defense. The only team in the playoffs playing worse D than Atlanta is Houston
@JerryHinnen as a hawks fan its embarrassing to see your team as arguably the greatest fluke #1 seed in NBA history
@peachtreehoops Has anyone seen Jeff Teague at all in the post season?
@ScottCarasik considering how bad the hawks have been all post season its basically game over
@JerryHinnen Hawks havent played well. I cant recall ever seeing a team who wins 60 games look as bad as ATL has
The Hawks are responsible for arguably the greatest fluke 19 game win streak in NBA history #ATLvsWAS #ATLHawks
This Hawks team is bad. As it stands today I sit and truly wonder how this team won anywhere close to 60 games.
@JerryHinnen Hawks havent been great when the starters are on the floor together, primarily because of how bad Teague has been since game 1
@talkhoops @Ricardo2wo Like delly isos.
@SomethingAbtFtb 45 catches for 15 yards and 6 TDs is pretty unique
@APfeifer24 But man he had like 2 good games vs the bucks
Mayweather vs Rose in a read off would be fun
@HurricaneStiz this. hate that shit bag
I really really hate the Bulls @lateralus2801
@crossoverNBA delly iso, should be a thing really
@lateralus2801 go gator
@TomFornelli scorching takes
@LostLettermen I want to get paid that much to be wrong all the time
Golson vs @_VH3? OK. Golson is the Viper. VH3 is the Mountain in this scenario. Not sure Golson wants to make that mistake
@ThomasGoldkamp people seem to forget how bad he looked last year. I'm more than happy with our secondary vs this kid.
@_dgr81_ I'd pick Dallas over playing for cam too
@ThomasGoldkamp i get it.
@ThomasGoldkamp what are you quoting? that link shows all of nothing. literally could replace it with a blank page
@MarkZinno The Hawks could use the test. They struggled with the Wiz until the 5 min mark Tuesday. Hawks have played @ an 8 seed level
@JarydWilson @ATLHawks_Reddit so ppl will root for a guy like wall to get hurt. which is sad. the hawks need the test. been a bad team
@JarydWilson @ATLHawks_Reddit Because fans are scum. The hawks have played at an 8 seed level the entire playoffs and ppl want help
@Laza1David @JohnKincade @kingcfb so its not a one game sample size. the hawks are playing 8 seed level ball in these playoffs. beatable
@Laza1David @JohnKincade @kingcfb the problem is Atlantas been missing those shots in every game minus game 6 vs Nets
@BTRowland just wait for the hawks to lose, twitter will be fun
@Laza1David @JohnKincade @kingcfb if Wall played the Hawks lose by 15-20 points at home and go into Washington down 2 games
@Laza1David @JohnKincade @kingcfb but ppl ignore how the game was close up until the 3 minute mark on tuesday. thats how avg the hawks are
@Laza1David @JohnKincade @ESPNSteinLine @kingcfb if only the hawks have been impressive enough for this injury to be a big difference maker
@BlatantHomerism as a hawks fan this is accurate
@_Verts @AnaheimAmigos isnt his hand swollen fat now though?
@JohnKincade This feels more like the Wiz just made the series even by losing Wall. With Wall? Wiz win in 6 games. I'd bet on it easy
@JohnKincade Teague and Dennis have been awful. You two should check their advanced #s. They have both been BAD
@crossoverNBA I look at it like this. Wiz just lost their PG? Hawks havent had a PG in this series yet. Wiz just happened to match us
@crossoverNBA I went to the game Sunday and sat their the entire 2nd half just waiting for them to blow the game. Just waiting.....
@crossoverNBA Talking about a team that has blown a 10+ point lead in every single game in a matter of a few minutes. Its just ridiculous
@crossoverNBA I'm a Hawks fan, have not been impressed by this team. I didn't even turn the game on Tuesday until the 4th
@crossoverNBA absolutely this. the hawks have not been good in this playoffs. Played like a 1 seed all of one game
@680_The_Fan Might want to update people, John Wall 5 broken bones in his left wrist per @ESPNSteinLine
@JohnKincade BREAKING NEWS FOR ATLANTA HAWKS: John Wall has 5 broken bones in his left hand per @ESPNSteinLine
@falcfans this team will fall behind 1-2. i wish i had the money to bet against my own team. this hawks team isnt very good
@CFBZ Hes been pretty average since the ASG. his confidence looks to have taken a hit since Dennis got the increase in PT since then
@chrisdimino But thats not likely going to stand. Sadly. You need solid PG play to win and hes been pretty avg since the ASG
@chrisdimino Sometimes I feel like calling in and giving Hawks fans (I am one, we met @ Falcons fantasy draft BTW) a reality check sometimes
@chrisdimino People need to talk more about how bad Jeff Teague is in this series. Really him and Dennis
@CFBZ sadly i dont see atlanta winning but maybe one more game in this series. Dennis and Teague are both playing just awful basketball
@MarkZinno @KenWeinmanSport The hawks blow a lead. We dont build leads with dennis on the floor. Him + Baze? Teams come back.
@MarkZinno @KenWeinmanSport Dennis was worse than -30 in the nets series and look @ 
@MarkZinno @KenWeinmanSport Jeff Teague has been AWFUL. Frankly, both him and Dennis have been bad in the playoffs. No PG. Issue #1
@Teague0 You should use the next 3 days off to find your balls. You're playing garbage. What happened to aggressive teague? Man up dude.
@JasonWalkerSBN They need it. Maybe Jeff Teague can use the rest time to find his balls
Jeff Teague sucks #ATLHawks
@peachtreehoops so how long has our starters played together today? Like 13 minutes again?
#voicesavekimberly
The #ATLHawks will:

-Get a 10+ pt lead and blow it
-Play the starters 8 mins together because that works
-Lose
@peachtreehoops cant wait for them to play 9 minutes together tonight. whoop
@BenVolin why cant goodell be put on it?
@deadmau5 @taylorsmifff seconded on the fuck off
@Carvell_AJC no rain in atlanta? clearly the radar is broke
@AnaheimAmigos do you agree with any of this? my rant on this game/series/team 
@NickdelaTorreGC NO ONE IS SHOCKED AT THIS
@trollvigilante i dont know who you are but you seem intelligent
@ScottCarasik Team has blown a 10 point lead in every single game
@ScottCarasik I predicted wiz in 5. Still like that prediction. This team just can't win vs competent teams in the playoffs
@AnaheimAmigos this game is a lot on teague. The guy was just awful. Conservative and scared the whole game
@peachtreehoops this team, for being so well coached, looks so bad and rushed in close game situations from behind
@lateralus2801 boxing is so terrible
@_dgr81_ gayer than cam newtons awful throwing motion
@_dgr81_ bro boxing is gay
if you combined soccer, basetball and golf its more exciting than boxing
@TDLockett12 best at running around and acting like a lil bitch
@SethDavisHoops how. How. How. How does a guy who does nothing win a round
@SilversteinAdam how does a guy who spends the entire match running and hugging win any rounds?
@CraigSagerJr yup. But can't complain losing like this.
@APfeifer24 100 bro
@_dgr81_ stream deets
@ScottCarasik what's up with this trade rumor with Grady to the seahawks?
@FBALL_Andrea i actually got embarrassed just watching it
@nfldraftscout as a falcons fan I don't know how to handle the emotions I'm feeling about us hitting on every single pick
@RyInCBus but are any of them wrs
@ScottCarasik @MikeClayNFL i still would have preferred maxx in the 2nd. taking a TE now just seems like we are stock piling average TEs
@ScottCarasik even more intelligent they didnt draft coates am i rite
@NickdelaTorreGC im honestly shocked he went this high
@IanKenyonNFL how many WRs do the packers need
@AllbrightNFL QUICK: Opinion on Falcons draft. Grade through 3 rounds?
@BryanDFischer Florida with 4 so far.

Jeff Driskel
@Cianaf bro you spend like 18 hours a day talking about the draft for the past month and you're already worn out? Blake Griffin stamina
@RapSheet @AroundTheNFL I'm a UF fan, I dont understand how Matt Jones went in the first two days.
@SomethingAbtFtb I dont like him. As a Gator, he needs to slim down to be useful in the new NFL
@FBALL_Andrea As a browns fan you have to like the sammie coates pick. i dont get his hype. he wasnt good this year at all
@Cianaf I dont get the sammie love, he dropped a lot of balls this year
@TheBlueFalcon10 To be fair, youre a little jaded because youre a Auburn fan. Ive talked to other scouts, poor mans torrey smith
@TheBlueFalcon10 yes
RIP Duke Johnson.
@WilliamsonNFL I dont get this pick in a way. West and Crowell isnt a bad 1/2 punch. They have bigger needs
@AllbrightNFL Thank you. A falcons blogger wants him @ 4. I say no. He has awful, awful, awful hands
@AllbrightNFL quick, opinion on sammie coates
@TheBlueFalcon10 @ScottCarasik He's fast. Thats it. He dropped everything thrown at him deep this year. His hands are AWFUL
@evansilva Pretty sure conley was a late round guy prior to the combine
@CFBZ Maybe Mike Smith was the problem the whole time? This is a Dan Quinn draft. Not a Mike Smith/TD draft
@ScottCarasik Guy has hands comparable to giving me bricks and asking me to catch a football with them
@ScottCarasik Oh god no
@TheFalcoholic im 2 out of 3 on this draft. i thought we went DE/OL/RB. Didnt see corner being there. So this is weird
@TheFalcoholic Me either im just being rarely optimistic and happy
@TheFalcoholic I think myself and all your followers should write Dimitroff a giant apology letter.
@TheFalcoholic so maybe it wasnt Dimitroff the whole time. Maybe it was mike smith the whole time. This is not a Dimitroff draft
@AllbrightNFL Just found it, thanks. Was hoping to find something other than unreliable pro day but that'll work
@AllbrightNFL You got a single clue as to the 40 of coleman?
@dpbrugler do you have a 40 time for Tevin Coleman by any chance? Anything to work with?
@CFBZ  see 
@CFBZ Dude is frankly beast mode potential
@TheFalcoholic I just orgasmed
@CraigSagerJr @chandlersutt eyesight is over rated.
@bartonsimmons teams are worried about some serious foot issues for Clemmings. thats why
@chandlersutt @CraigSagerJr the size of this image in relation to the tv and the amount of black surrounding it irrationally bothers me
@peachtreehoops We lost
@peachtreehoops He's been indescribably bad this series
@FBALL_Andrea I wanted Maxx in atlanta so badly. i sad
@MyersNFL Has Vick been drafted yet?
@MyersNFL Too short. Probably will be a bust. I'd have waited on manziel personally but what do I know
@MyersNFL they just showed the falcons taking Vic Beasley here so I apologize for my stupidity
Of course the hawks look like world beaters after I spend $40 on two tickets to game 7 earlier today
@talkhoops of course this happens after I spend a whopping $40 on two tickets to game 7 on Sunday
@MyersNFL bro its the second round fyi
@BobRathbunTV @SportSouth rooting for the hawks from my dinner spot of burger king
@ScottCarasik what happened to alford? thought the falcons were big on him
@falcfans Same. I dont know how to feel. I didnt realize another corner was such a need they would spend a 2nd rounder on it
@CFBZ oh god please
@nfl this is ridiculous. Twitter knows the picks 30 minutes before they hit TV
@hami1018a @TheFalcoholic i love him. instant starter here over the garbage we have @ MLB.
@TheFalcoholic FS please. We got like 81 linebackers to choose from
@ScottCarasik Funchess to Carolina
Mariotta to DGB, you like that @AllbrightNFL ;)
@PFF_Steve i like to think he was a kiffined this year. lane had an awful rb rotation and his usage was all over the place this year
@ThomasGower He was kiffined. Kiffin had a awful RB rotation there at bama. He couldnt figure out who to run and when to run them
@Cianaf do you like anyone
@peachtreehoops NFL Draft
@APMarkLong @ESPNdirocco only when jeff driskel is the QB
@AllbrightNFL As a Florida fan I dont know how DJ Humphries gets drafted in the top 3 rounds, his tape is awful. Well? Size. Potential.
@AllbrightNFL size + "potential" is the easiest answer to these kind of things
@ryanlownes Absolutely. I foresee no less than 15 trades today.
@falcfans People will hate it because you dont take a probable guard that high
@MattJ_onNFL @JuMosq I honestly believed it because of the Pats taking a backup QB way early last year
@JuMosq @MattJ_onNFL why would the packers spend a 2nd round pick on a backup QB? They that concerned about ARods recent injury history??
@MockingTheDraft I cant imagine Atlanta trading up for anything but an offensive linemen.
@RossTuckerNFL isn't it always?
@FantasyGopher @TheCFX Maxx to Atlanta would be nice
@TheFalcoholic I actually expect atlanta to pick twice today. I get the sense there is a run on skill players and they trade into late 2nd
@TheFalcoholic yeah but thats not saying much considering levine was the worst TE in football
@TheFalcoholic i still want maxx williams. im embarrassed that our staff thinks the FA TE signings actually improve our TE position
@PFF_Steve as a falcons fan i came into this wanting, in order: beasley, fowler, lw, dupree.
@NEPD_Loyko was it really cheap though? one team traded a 4th and a future 5th to move up all of 2 spots. thats not cheap
@PFF_Steve how do you like beasley to atlanta? im hoping the staff can get him up 10 pounds by preseason
@agentlinton Rams...Gurley
@ShanePHallam @daverichard @allinkid fast, dreds bad hands. Seems pretty simple man
@agentlinton @DougKyedNESN Colts trying to average 53 points a game
@daverichard i would have preferred them taking Dorsett. Faster, better hands.
@agentlinton @DougKyedNESN I dont disagree with Dorsett going in the first, I disagree with the team that took him in the first.
@agentlinton @DougKyedNESN counter argument? plenty of WRs they can get at a better spot. 3rd and 4th. Why spend 1st on 3/4th WR?
@agentlinton @DougKyedNESN i dont think there is much rationalization to the colts not going D. They basically drafted TY Hilton again
@AschoffESPN Im lost on him. He was a mid first rounder a month or two ago. Suddenly got ripped to shreds the last two weeks
Reporters reporting coaches feel good about a player they drafted. In other news reporters showing why coaches think they are a joke
@AllKindsWeather just imagine if we had a real coach we would have run them out of their own building by halftime
@MockingTheDraft Shane Ray dominated him. He needed help vs speed rushers throughout his career. His only plus area is as a run blocker
@MockingTheDraft im surprised at the B for Humps to AZ. Hes never once flashed first round potential playing at Florida (im a UF guy)
@_dgr81_ saints?
@_dgr81_ whats the next two picks i wanna watch nba
@HurricaneStiz Dude is solid, but the Colts defense is garbage. and they already have a bunch of speed WRs. Literally makes no sense
@BartHubbuch @tomecurran nah i think their defense is still that bad
The Colts just drafted TY Hilton again
@fbgwood can you run fast? do you have dreds? do you drop the ball a lot? Ravens will take you
Shane Ray absolutely demolished DJ Humphries this past year.  DJ should have quit playing football the next day. Thats how bad it was
@PFF_Steve better run blocker than pass blocker by a lot. like i told a cardinals fan on reddit:

madden rating
run block: 80, pass block 72
@ABLichtenstein Well considering the fact he was just an insanely average OT for UF.....never came close to his hype @ UF
@PFF_Steve Im a UF fan, he never once lived up to his potential. Not even close. I dont get how he jumped to the 1st
@falcfans im a UF fan,i dont know what people saw in this kid. He never, not once, lived up to his #1 OT 5 star rating. Not once
@MattHarmon_BYB shaq thompson ....soon
@_dgr81_ LOL
@_dgr81_ madden ratings:

run block 83

pass block 75
@_dgr81_ not a bad run blocker because hes so athletic. that might be a reason.
@_dgr81_ basically rose because he has a tyron smith like build to him and people hope he fills that potential
@_dgr81_ and im fine with that. he never lived up to his potential at florida. got pushed around a lot. slow to recover.
@nflnetwork ESPN is just crushing you right now. They have highlight cuts of picks, you have nothing.
@nflnetwork how is it that you are showing NO highlights of any of these players?
@falcfans you like the pick?
@Cianaf whats your quick take on beasley to atlanta? missed it. twitter is buzzing
@FBALL_Andrea bryce petty because screw you browns fans.
im so confused
whaaaat
@TheFalcoholic Thats a fine trade off while we figure out the MLB position. Thats not Beasleys concern, period.
@MyersNFL why? Who the falcons other pass rushe
@TheFalcoholic grab your beer
@FO_ASchatz I really wish the falcons would just take Maxx and get it over with tomorrow
@TheFalcoholic No kidding dude. I havent been this happy since like 2012 for atlanta
@_dgr81_ @lateralus2801 NO SIR
if the falcons dont take beasley im going to rage @TheFalcoholic
@_dgr81_ YES
@_dgr81_ changed my name to this
if the titans really refused to take the philly offer that was reported they truly are the dumbest fucking franchise in existence
@ScottCarasik google falcons head coach in google.
@PFF_Gordon @PFF_Sam thats a shame. this draft is already off to a horrible start
@PFF_Sam what about punters in the third
@NEPD_Loyko so business as usual
@ScottCarasik good luck
@MattSmithCFB I dont know how anyone can do:

- Berman
- McShay
- Kiper

How? Really. Someone tell me how you do this?
@MockingTheDraft if Atlanta takes ray I'm burning my falcons stuff and becoming a saints fan to spite the franchise. Hate ray that much
@TheBlueFalcon10 @falcfans if we draft shane ray i might burn all my falcons shit and become a panthers fan out of anger. I HATE the kid
@TheBlueFalcon10 @falcfans look @ TDs first round "success", its ugly. I expect the worst tonight. Only thing you should w/Dimitroff
@TheBlueFalcon10 @falcfans i consider him desperate because dimitroff is supposed to be this major character guy. That would go against that
@TheBlueFalcon10 @falcfans There are a ton of warning signs around Gregory right now. I dont see this team going that route
@falcfans I want to see what they do if Bud, Beasley, LW and Fowler are all gone. Trade down, go O, or get desperate and take Ray/Gregory
@themantz you sure? i mean we're going to have 19 teams trade up to the titans
@themantz per Twitter every team is taking 40 players in this draft. Should be exciting.
@FrontOfficeLos The issue is i dont see teams willing to trade up to 8 if all of Dante/Bud/LW/Beasley are gone.
@BobRedman_Scout Bring in a coach to instill his own principles and system into a bunch of young kids. Could be worse.
@BobRedman_Scout Also, its probably a good time to hit the reset button. This team is very young and likely only 8-9 seed good at best
@AschoffESPN @DaveJonesSports Love Billy, but I'm fine with a new coach working with a very young and inexperienced team as his own now
@AschoffESPN @DaveJonesSports Im of the opinion this is a good time for UF to hit the reset button. Talent is 9-10 seed good at best
@DK_Thompson just for the love of all things do not hire pelph or grant
@AllbrightNFL why is mariota getting Andrew Luck talent treatment? Its not there. At all
@D_Majors21 @TheFalcoholic He can also shift to DE in passing downs. He's flexible, where the guys we signed prior just really are not
@D_Majors21 @TheFalcoholic OLB. BUCK/LEO to be precise. Something hes better at then either of the LBers we signed
@MikeSGallagher FIRED
I just want the #AtlantaHawks to play like a 1 seed, just once, this series. That would be nice
@CraigSagerJr @TylerKitchens Its pathetic. one of the worst offenses and defenses of the playoffs.
@peachtreehoops if it was 13 id be comfortable
@gatorhoops when you make the money he does, does it matter in the end?
@chadjshanks you didnt do anything wrong though. You just got unlucky working for an overly pc company like @HoustonRockets
@SomethingAbtFtb Driskel has as much a chance to play in the NFL as you do
@SomethingAbtFtb Jeff Driskel
@ThomasGoldkamp Billy/Shula/Bowden/Spurrier ? Billy has a consistent long run. Same national titles as Meyer.
@ThomasGoldkamp But no I'd go shula over urban clearly.
@ThomasGoldkamp I think I read it the wrong way? I thought the list already had billy/spurrier/bowden on it. But yea its tough
@ThomasGoldkamp Absolutely should be. He put basketball on the map for the most part. He gave UF fans something to root for during Zook/WM
@ThomasGoldkamp how can it not be urban. he won 2 national titles here. just because he left the way he did doesnt take that away from him
@CraigSagerJr dennis :(
@ThomasGoldkamp @JesseReSimonton with durant and westbrook arguably not coming back + all the young talent in orlando....
@ThomasGoldkamp @JesseReSimonton I think he would be a better fit in Orlando right now too. Thats the sad part.
@ThomasGoldkamp ....have generally given up a lot of three pointers and not guarded that area very well.
@ThomasGoldkamp oh yeah i agree, his x's and o's will leave a lot to be desired. Hes going to have to do better on D too. His teams...
@RUSSLANDE @TheFalcoholic i will no longer be a falcons fan if they draft this kid
@APfeifer24 i could care less about this post
@ThomasGoldkamp i think the fear is primarily that MOST college coaches fail and fail pretty hard in the NBA.
@ThomasGoldkamp Its interesting to see the amount of OKC fans who are just flat out angry at the idea of Billy being hired
@agentlinton @jcps you should hit up their Facebook. They have a protected account
@AllbrightNFL you mean to tell me fans are fickle idiots? While I never
@AllKindsWeather I'd rather it just happen. The makeup of this this team sucks. Good time to hit the reset button
@Coach_Kennard42 @gatorhoops I'm mostly confused why he would take the job with the odds being in favor of Durant leaving in a yest
@gatorhoops No one should be upset. Its actually good timing for the reset button to be hit considering the build of this team
@ThomasGoldkamp how worried are you about Grant or Pelph being promoted? I dont like either of those two choices to takeover for BD
@ScottCarasik well the answer is yes teddy.maybe for bortles. he hasnt done enough for me to think hes franchise QB good.
@ScottCarasik borltes looks like he might not really get it for another 2 years
@ScottCarasik better team right away or in the long run? right away with bortles? no. teddy? yes.
@APMarkLong You complain a lot
@ChrisTrapasso I think worrying about a 2nd contract for a guy who hasnt been drafted yet is a bit exaggerated thinking
@ThomasGoldkamp Yea. good for him. dont quit this time. Archie Miller time? I'm hoping we just go after him hard
@ThomasGoldkamp considering the makeup of this team is 8 seed good at best, probably best timing for Billy to leave.
@ThomasGoldkamp Yea I wasn't sure how to take it. Frankly im kind of cool with this being the timing of a reset button being pushed for us
@ThomasGoldkamp have you seen this?? 
See ya later Billy
@JohnMiddlekauff are we including the fact that it took 20 minutes for 3 game minutes to go by because of officiating?
@TroyMachir Reggie Miller
At 12:35 this game was at 5:35 left in the 3rd quarter. It is now 12:52 and we have 2 minutes left.
@JohnMiddlekauff But hes not good at basketball and plays like 15 minutes a game so he kind of cheats at it
This is easily the slowest, worst called game of the #NBAPlayoffs
I'm going to be really disappointed if the internet doesnt give me like at least 6 reaction gifs from this Clippers game.
@HurricaneStiz i forgot it was still going. thought it was done like 3 weeks ago. whoops
@BryanDFischer That seems excessive but what do I know
@ZachLowe_NBA This is like if a 1 and 3 seed played in the first round of the NCAA tournament. NBA has to fix this problem.
@TFrei i see no possible way a fight involving mayweather lives up to $99
@FloydMayweather @_VH3 which of your publicist typed this out for you?
@SomethingAbtFtb beat writers are basically better paid bloggers and most bloggers are a joke.
@SomethingAbtFtb because beat writers are mostly a joke
@ATLHawks @BobRathbunTV @DWilkins21 Team has some major rotation problems right now. Tough to watch this team play right now
@ATLHawks @BobRathbunTV @DWilkins21 FYI Bob, Hawks are giving up 19 uncontested 3s a game. 12 of which closest defender is 6ft&gt; away. Ouch
@ATLHawks @BobRathbunTV @DWilkins21 Game 5 adjustment #1: Play defense better.
@AnaheimAmigos @raptureveteran @ATLJD I'd say wasting 30 seconds trying to tie the game instead of going for the quick 2 and playing D&gt;that
@ATLJD @AnaheimAmigos not the reason we lost
@AnaheimAmigos Am I reading this right? 

we give 19 threes a game to the nets where closest defender is 4+ ft away?
@ThomasNassiff Buzzfeed? I just cant even
@SpearsNBAYahoo Thats a lot of overly confident kids who think they are ready for the nba
@davidessexfl @IAKOWNeil we aren't a free country though. So that's a big problem
@JohnRunsFast I dont either. it was silly. I deleted it. Moving on past it and laughing at him for blocking me.
@JohnRunsFast The guy is insanely touchy though. As telling by how often he blocks people on twitter he doesnt like talking to
@JohnRunsFast True. Won't argue that
@JohnRunsFast @HPbasketball He's done that to a lot of people who ask for a real conversation. I could have approached it differently yes
@JohnRunsFast  @HPbasketball I dont care if he agrees with my opinion. I really dont. The short sarcastic response accomplishes nothing
@HPbasketball out of the coverage he keeps calling? Why not change your scheme if ARod is hurting you? Thats this Hawks D vs the Nets
@HPbasketball If a DC in FBall called the same play on D that kept getting torched by ARod, would that DC be getting out coached for not adj
@MattesonTrevor @_nbafan88 I feel like its as simple as Bud telling KK to cheat, dont crash. Play the passing lane. Stop hitting the RA
@MattesonTrevor @_nbafan88 thats what we are doing. Nets see a weakness, they are exploiting it, buds not changing out of it at all
@MattesonTrevor @_nbafan88 it would be like calling zone in football despite manning torching you and you never change your coverage.
@MattesonTrevor @_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos if a team does 1 thing that keeps hurting them and they dont adjust out of that, thats coaching
@MattesonTrevor @_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos well no, they shouldnt. You're right. Not vs a team that was a loss away from a lotto pick
@MattesonTrevor @_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos thats leading to a quick Lopez touch and pass out to one of two wide open guards. No adj to it
@MattesonTrevor @_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos The Nets abuse the PnR because we aren't defending it well. KK crashes too hard
@MattesonTrevor @_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos It's not crazy to state hes getting out coached. Watch the 2nd half and OT
@MattesonTrevor @_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos in the top 25 IIRC, all of them rank higher than the starting 5 lineup. Thabo is huge on D
@MattesonTrevor @_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos if you look at the top lineups in the NBA on 
@MattesonTrevor @_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos Thabo is a huge difference maker. The defensive efficiency jumps 7 points w/him on the floor
@HPbasketball Problem could potentially get solved if Bud stopped gang banging Lopez in the paint when he touches the ball
@HPbasketball Except I just stated how the Nets are attacking what they see as a key weakness. they get the shot they want when they run PnR
@HPbasketball They are abusing it with a pick and roll, Horford goes too high, DC and Korver too aggressive biting into paint, open 3s
@HPbasketball Buds getting out coached right now. No adjustments in 4 games to this problem either.
@MattesonTrevor @_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos team top 10 in efficiency D giving up 40 uncontested FGAs a game is bad. To a 8 seed @ that
@MattesonTrevor @_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos Thabo being out hurts, yes, absolutely. Still no excuse for this low level D. It's really bad
@_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos sarcasm? Hawks wasted 30 seconds trying to tie instead of going for 2 and playing D. ATL can only blame ATL
@MattesonTrevor @_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos The rotating is BAD. Thats my issue. The nets are killing us on corner 3s because of Korver
@ATLHawks So yea, ill see you...sunday? For Game 7? Why waste my money when the Hawks will 100% lose on Friday in BKN
@ATLHawks But why go to the game tomorrow when I can save my money for game 7 which we all know there will be a game 7
@_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos Lopez being doubled is fine. Gang banged by every guy on the floor? Excessive. When it constantly leads to UFGA
@_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos Joe? Guy who is averaging his lowest PPG since 02-03? Lowest ORTG since 03-04? That Joe Johnson needs doubling?
@JoshNorris Seems more like a #KeyAndPeele sketch in the making
@ScottCarasik Watching the Ed Snowden documentary made me mad as fuck. Like went to a 9 out 10 anger scale at the end of that movie
@ScottCarasik Last 4th of July in a bar everyone was chanting USA USA. Me and a friend started a "NSA NSA" chant and killed the vibe. WHOOPS
@ScottCarasik True. It just pisses me off. I get mad when I hear idiots act like this is the best country ever. How out of touch are people?
@ScottCarasik With all this NSA, Facebook, Google, ISP news coming out about how we have no privacy or freedom...4th of July is a joke now
@ScottCarasik Its getting worse in America. People just like to ignore the reality that we aren't this awesome free country anymore.
@ScottCarasik This is america, lets remember this before acting like rational thought wins out
@_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos here is my angry post game rant instead of blowing up twitter 
@_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos based off what i saw yesterday? I feel safe saying Bud is getting out coached right now.
@_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos Lopez doesnt need an entire team gang bang the moment he touches the ball. This is all excessive.
@_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos Sure, missing Thabo hurts, but I also think just playing BKN straight up would help too. Joe doesnt need a double
@_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos there is 0 need for 4-5 Hawks to attack the paint every time the ball enters that area. 40 uncontested FGA for BKN
@_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos Our D has always been gimmicky kind of man instead of a straight man to man. Its being abused this series
@_nbafan88 @AnaheimAmigos Have you seen the rotation problems? The nets are murdering us from the corners on 3 and we have made no adjust.
@RagjUF FB infuriates me, at least in terms of making me realize I am friends with people who don't care about anything but American Idol
@AnaheimAmigos or the defense. Can people stop ignoring how bad the hawks defense is? Because its bad. Really, really, really bad
@RagjUF Posting the Snowden documentary link up asking for feedback from it netted 0 replies. I think I have terrible friends
@RagjUF I'm apparently friends with people who don't care about politics or current events because I see NOTHING on any of this. Nothing.
@RagjUF if you hate facebook so much then a) delete it or b) unfriend the idiots who bother you so easily?
@ScottCarasik @PFF to be like literally every other person on twitter?
@HurricaneStiz you dont really need to live in the city to call this shit how it needs to be called
@HPbasketball For some unexplainable reason Bud has 5 guys hit the paint every time the ball goes low. No clue why.
@HPbasketball Hawks have not defended well all series sir.
@ATLHawks No ill save my money for Game 7 because we all know the Hawks are losing on friday
@francisadujr @HPbasketball I've been called a hater by literally every single fan base of the teams ive grown up watching so
@francisadujr @HPbasketball it could go for me too because i spend a lot of time being negative about all the teams i root for.
@francisadujr @HPbasketball i can only take so much of this garbage the hawks, braves and falcons give ATL fans in the playoffs my friend
@francisadujr @HPbasketball of course, because im passionate and tired of watching the teams i like shit the bed in the playoffs
@Subacart @HPbasketball because clearly those 60 games are coming in handy right now
@LewHenry @HPbasketball and by easy i mean lazy as shit
@LewHenry @HPbasketball but its easier to just point to 60 wins and say "BUT LOOK THEY ARE FINE GUYS I PROMISE SEE THEY WON 60 GAMES"
@LewHenry @HPbasketball and the blatant visual fact that Atlanta is not playing great basketball.
@Subacart @HPbasketball apparently people need a greater sample size than the hawks playing below average basketball for 4 games now
@HPbasketball The hawks are a 1 seed, they shouldnt be getting torched from 3 by this nets team. not with the wiz up next. Maybe
@MarkZinno The first game should have been a wakeup call. The fact they blew a 12 point lead  in about 6 minutes is telling
@HPbasketball Prior to this game we had the lowest FG% of the entire playoffs on top of that. This is going 7 games and im not sure we win
@HPbasketball Its not a good team. No, its not. This D is AWFUL. We must be giving up 15+ uncontested 3s a game.
@HPbasketball I see your sarcasm but i see you think the regular season is relevant to today. Im sorry you think the Hawks are a good team
@HPbasketball Dont be shocked if they win this series
@JarydWilson This Hawks D is trash. IF they win this series, they wont get to 5 games vs the Washington backcourt
Thats the worst call Bud has EVER drawn up
Joe Johnson game winner incoming on the buzzer
@SomethingAbtFtb i dont root for injuries but im glad i no longer have to worry about this kid coming to atlanta.
@ATLHawks_Reddit The hawks not being a good basketball team is what is happening
@peachtreehoops This is not a good atlanta hawks basketball team as of 4/27/2015
Hawks are not a good basketball team
@CraigSagerJr this. So much this. I think bud lost his way after the all star game
@osgators I'm convinced Kasey hill is the worst pg I've ever seen run a Florida basketball team. Jeff Driskel of point guards
@osgators I'm so glad carter and walker are gone. Perfect world, Kasey follows them out
I enjoy seeing how one race does so little to fight the public perception of them. Equally as ignorant as cops in 2015
@ChrisTrapasso Move up to 5 for who? Neither QB will be there
@RyInCBus The idea of a game led by Manziel and Mariota sounds absolutely terrible.
Chris Walker, gone.

Eli Carter, gone.

Now if only we could somehow convince Kasey Hill to gtfo we would better by default next year
@jeffborzello As a Florida fan, thank....god.  If Kasey Hill could follow him and Walker out the door it would be addition by subtraction
@ChrisDobbertean Truth of the matter was Carter was garbage compared to what we expected. Timid and just horrible offensively
@ChrisDobbertean This hurts the team literally not at all. The more guys off last years team that leave, the better
@CollinCowart @ATLHawksPhil @BuddyGrizzard It would be nice if he played right now. Team is lacking so much offense in this series, why not?
@agentlinton You mean to tell me MY expertise was wrong? What the hell do these idiot front office guys know over ME? MrBlogger for SBNation
@BuddyGrizzard i guess when the team is the worst offensive unit of the playoff it would be hard to blame one guy for dragging O down.
@BuddyGrizzard 3-12, 2 assists, 2 turnovers. I guess we can call this "playing like every other hawk not named Carroll"
@becb_sbn @ChrisDobbertean if only this solved the problem of teams passing around the perimeter for 28 seconds only to miss a open jumper
@BuddyGrizzard what. Hes been a disaster on offense
@Cianaf Do people really actually take your tweets about the draft leading up to it as gospel?
@AllbrightNFL im looking more forward to it being over then the actual process of watching it now because everyone is an expert here
@AllbrightNFL no kidding. Twitter has ruined the draft.
Twitter has successfully ruined the NFL draft
@AllbrightNFL i just cant wait for all this to be over with
@agentlinton Facts would be its twitter, twitter is mostly horrible and people are going to blow up over every single pick in the 1st round
@agentlinton LW?
@HPbasketball where does that steam power come from though
I think im at that point now where tweeting about baseball is grounds for an unfollow. Terrible sport. Shockingly worse than college bball
I really get the most random followers who I think obviously dont read any of my sports related tweets. Go away women
@CharlieKel89 Nets completely stopped closing out on our shooters today and just camped out for the rebound and it was smart of them
@CharlieKel89 Baze is a disaster. Scott bricks everything. Horfords mid range shot is gone cuz of his finger. Teague has been below avg
@CharlieKel89 There is a statistically proven downward trend across the board for Atlanta from Game 1 to Game 3. Thats a trend.
@CharlieKel89 And its not an opinion. Its a fact. Look at the advanced metrics off basketball-reference for each of the 3 playoff games
@CharlieKel89 Way too many problems with this Hawks team. A lot of ISO ball, bad movement, bad spacing, inconsistent pace of play
@CharlieKel89 My prediction? Beat Nets in 6, possibly 7. Playing that badly. Lose to Wiz in 6. Cavs beat Bulls 4-2 and beat Wiz 4-1 probably
@CharlieKel89 so you're only a real fan if you're a delusional idiot who thinks the hawks are the best ever?
@CharlieKel89 ignorance here is astounding. Tell me more moron
@ATLHawks can we get a discount because of terrible offensive product for three games
@CharlieKel89 and no I absolutely don't believe in this team. I'd bet on the wiz with ease next series. Easy money
@CharlieKel89 my problem is the hawks have played not well for 3 games. Its not just this game alone
@CharlieKel89 Yes, im allowed to be unbiased and rational. Being a delusionally optimistic idiot isnt a requirement to be a fan
@CharlieKel89 @peachtreehoops how about just calling this a bad series? Hawks havent look remotely close to 1 seed good at a single point
@CharlieKel89 @peachtreehoops if the hawks struggle this much w/a bad 8 seed team how do we figure they match up against the wiz exactly?
@exhoopsPRguy @CVivlamoreAJC or korver or dennis or teague or antic or scott or baze
@AlexSontyHoops @peachtreehoops The Hawks wont beat the Nets by 10+ in a single game.
Jeff Teague is not a good basketball player
@peachtreehoops But the Hawks have played far below average for 3 games now so whats the excuse when the sample size is 3 games
@BuddyGrizzard Korver Korver gives us a legit scoring option even on an off night. Baze offers.....just nothing on offense on most nights
@BuddyGrizzard Why is bazemore playing 49 minutes in this game? This is an inexcusably bad decision by Bud
@peachtreehoops WHY IS BAZEMORE PLAYING 50 MINUTES IN THIS GAME
@HPbasketball The more i watch this series the more im convinced its going 7 games. Hawks are that bad
@ScottCarasik the hawks have played pretty much straight garbage the entire series
thats basically game over at this pace
Can we not play Bazemore anymore? He's really awful, this whole series
@HPbasketball Baze is so bad
@peachtreehoops really shocked that the hawks went on this run in front of 817 Nets fans. Really impressive
@BuddyGrizzard either way, just dont pay him top 10 PG $ when you have a guy with a higher ceiling in Dennis who is currently playing better
@BuddyGrizzard My ideal situation would be to trade him after next year. UFA in 2017, Dennis RFA in 2017. Or sign and trade in 2017 offssn
@GibbyRob @HPbasketball true, the problem is they should probably show some signs of it now vs a bad team and not wait for washington
@BuddyGrizzard i might be the only hawks fan in existence who does not like teauge and really wants him traded and this be dennis' team
@BuddyGrizzard that would be a first
@GibbyRob @HPbasketball im sorry, even though i know im exaggerating, this hawks team is playing like garbage for 3 games now. vs a bad team
@peachtreehoops this team looks so lazy and uninterested they need this halftime speech 
@GibbyRob @HPbasketball its the east. the hawks arent getting to the ECF
@StarvingScout I imagine the Myles Jack hype is going to be through the roof in the offseason
@JarydWilson i dont imagine for a moment that the hawks are out shooting the nets from deep. hawks missing damn near everything from 3
@HPbasketball id place the hawks chances of getting to the ECF at a solid 20% right now
@HPbasketball that basically everyone bases their entire opinion around. im a pessimistic hawks fan but really not impressed by last 3 games
@HPbasketball The first month they played at a 8 seed level. the last 2 months they played at a 6 seed level. then the random pretty streak
@HPbasketball I think this is really just the real Hawks.
I can fully understand why Dennis is getting increased PT, Teagues play is just really insanely average
The idea that the #Hawks could beat the Wizards right now is utterly hilarious. This team has about a 10% chance of getting to ECF
I'm curious if the coach of the year wants to like, actually coach sometime today
Hawks look rather awful
Nothing worse than going to a job interview where they say they will get back to you on the job. Pessimist in me is not pleased
The teams are not drafting who you put 9 hours into thinking they will draft. Your scouting reports are wrong. Go away
I've come to the realization that twitter really makes me want the NFL draft to be over. This is an insufferable time of the offseason
@TomFornelli yea but look who is on the floor. its either him or middleton
@SAF4SAFF talk dirty to me
@BruceWizayne this bucks game tho
The pace of this game reminds me that college basketball only fans are just really dumb people
@AverageGatorGuy kind of sad really. He doesn't have a NBA future and the articles state he might not enter draft
@AverageGatorGuy walker is gone. Yes yes yes. Best Florida news since national signing day
@WhyLee23 walker gone finally. Thank god
Chris Walker not back to Florida is awesome news. You at a bad basketball player sir. You're going to need a lot of luck in the NBA hunt
@DanielGillman Please dont tell me youre one of the guys who finds this boring but thinks college basketball is fun...
@ScottCarasik Better reply would be....if a guy already reached his full potential in college I dont want him in the NFL
@talkhoops you'll get the hawks and wizards and you will like it
@SAF4SAFF its a phone interview. probably a good thing.
@SAF4SAFF but ive had such bad luck job interviewing im not expecting anything from it so
@SAF4SAFF Lol. Ill accept officially tomorrow depending on this job interview i have for this network engineer apprentinceship.
@DanWolken Well does it?
@SAF4SAFF got ya back
@SAF4SAFF Random: Do you run a dynasty? Have room? Ive been looking to join one forever but i dont want to join a random of reddits one
@Brooklynnets85 @HPbasketball How you didnt mention Lillards play is beyond me
@Brooklynnets85 @HPbasketball Wade wasnt exactly very good last year though so lets keep his name out of it in regards to playoffs.
@HPbasketball See I can agree with this. I'm ok with this first round being this bad if the rest of it makes up for it
@HPbasketball @Brooklynnets85 ive watched every single game too.
@Brooklynnets85 @HPbasketball Exactly. Im not sure what cocaine HP is on because this is insanely boring 1st vs last year
@BuddyGrizzard we are thankful Nets had DWill shoot that and not Jack. Doubling joe would have led to a tie game if a good shooter took it
@BuddyGrizzard Mostly just hate the doubling of Joe. He doesnt deserve that much respect anymore. We are handing BKN a ton of open 3s
@HPbasketball Well yea. But im comparing this year to last year and last year was....very fun
@HPbasketball compared to last year this is like....D level first round
@HPbasketball ummm, most of these games havent been very competitive though
@SAF4SAFF Good. get this shit over with. twitter is the fucking worse during this time of the year
@BuddyGrizzard im so torn on our D. The Rotating still bothers me but they still fill lanes and forced a lot of turnovers on steals.
@BuddyGrizzard So where are we leaning? Hawks playing this average or just playing at the nets level? playing down has been a problem
@AndyGlockner Then they turn around and put up 100+ on the Cavs in a mostly dominating win. Just the way these guys have been all year
@AndyGlockner To be fair, ATL has played at their opponents level all season. Knicks, Sixers, Magic come to mind right now.
@talkhoops Im really interested to see what ATL does in 2 years with those two contract
@Kris_Willis @ATLHawks to be honest it literally took this crowd 4 quarters to get there. They were GARBAGE in the first half
@Kris_Willis Thank god. Him and Horford didnt look good sunday. i think they both need 12-15+ a game for us to be 1 seed good. good sign
Horford is playing out of his mind right now. Love watching this
@Kris_Willis he seems to be struggling a lot lately. wonder if that injury is still in his mind
Hey @ATLHawks maybe you should try and get the crowd hype? Our crowd is boring. Worst crowd in all of the playoffs so far.
Teague crosses someone into another dimension but completely kills the highlight tape by doing what every hawk has done today. missed layup
@BuddyGrizzard or maybe tweetdeck is slow but i literally just got that tweet like 45 seconds ago
@BuddyGrizzard I wrote this like 10 minutes ago. Times change. You tend to reply slower than dirk nowitzkis feet move now. hes fine now
@peachtreehoops Yo, we might have the worst crowd in the entire playoffs. This place is silent compared to, well, any other teams crowd
@BuddyGrizzard so who gets Millsaps minutes because hes been garbage
Hawks losing to the Nets. This is embarrassing
@peachtreehoops as we force a turnover
@peachtreehoops well....regardless of that number, our d is playing like shit right now.
@peachtreehoops our D is pissing me off. Shooting lights out but bad rotating again keeping nets in it
@AverageGatorGuy neither walker or hill will do shit.  you cant save hills shot. its like tebow as a passer in the nfl. there is no hope
@AverageGatorGuy And recruiting classes are a wash. we all thought kasey hill and chris walker would elevate us. They are garbage
@AverageGatorGuy the KD thing is probably going to be a bigger say than anything.
@talkhoops I approve of said open 3 pointers /hawks fan
@AverageGatorGuy Rather than him wait 3 years when the team will actually likely be good again and then we scramble
@AverageGatorGuy Id rather him go now then wait. Lets hit the reset button while the team isnt talented
@peachtreehoops They are so bad at this. Equally ridiculous for Falcons games. Takes 45 minutes to get into a game.
@WhyLee23 I wish Walker and Hill would get the fuck out. they are both garbage liabilities. Hopefully neither starts next year. Or both tran
@WhyLee23 @ZachAbolverdi PG spot it still being run by a scrub in Hill. Walker is still going to be a soft awful option @ the 4/5
@WhyLee23 @ZachAbolverdi egbunu is raw offensively. devon walker was about as inconsistent as it got 2 years ago. DR might blow up. thats it
@HPbasketball Sounds perfect for the Lakers job next year am i right
@ZachAbolverdi It has to be depressing to look at your roster and see 0 offense at the 4/5 spot unless DFS is playing the 4.
@ZachAbolverdi Nor should he, frankly. Lets see: Ibaka, Westbrook and Durant or the utter garbage that composes the UF roster right now?
@ScottCarasik Or you know just read twitter
@DanWolken @BlatantHomerism with the "talent" on the team I dont think it really matters who they pick to coach it
@AllKindsWeather It wouldnt shock me if he goes because this team he runs right now is SO GOD DAMN BAD
@Rand_Getlin @TomahawkNation And the world fully believes this
@falcfans RW= old and regressing, no go to RB, no TE, no reliable slot WR. I wouldnt be mad if we spent all but 1 pick on offense
@falcfans to play devils advocate to a degree, this team really does lack talent on O. People seem to ignore this constantly
@falcfans sounds like a job for thomas dimitroff
@TheFalcoholic id rather go amari cooper or kevin white over a recovering gurley if we are talking  about stupid decisions
@TheFalcoholic Falcons taking Shane Ray is the quickest way to me boycotting the Falcons for an entire season though so there is that
@TheFalcoholic Which honestly I would prefer over Shane Ray if it came down to those two
@SAF4SAFF Goodell a man of the people, thinking about fantasy owners world wide
@SigmundBloom @CharlesRobinson drafting shane ray would be the quickest way for many falcons fans to boycott this season
@SigmundBloom @CharlesRobinson I just dont see Atlanta taking Gurley. Though, as a ATL fan, I would take him over Shane Ray in an instant
@SEC_Chuck Would you refer a friend to go to Afghanistan? Thats how I feel about the state of Alabama.
@SEC_Chuck Thats probably a good thing for everyone who hasnt visited alabama before
@AllKindsWeather thats ugly as hell. lets be honest. how can you look at that all the time
@MikeBgsw @HPbasketball its not an exaggeration to state NO had 5-6 poss. in a row where some1 drove into lane, threw it up looking for foul
@MoveTheSticks Truthfully I wonder why wider splits like this aren't more common. Meyers wide splits have always had success vs SEC for ex
@MikeBgsw @HPbasketball On the flip side if NO spent more time running an organized offense instead of one arming it up...they probably win
@HPbasketball They spent damn near entire 4th hoping for bail out whistles on every shot. Sub that in w/running an actual offense? GS loses
@HPbasketball Physical Memphis should worry them or most of all cleanly run offenses in SA or LAC. Warriors dont look strong to me
@HPbasketball I feel like this game mostly just showed that GS is really beatable. NO played pickup ball on O tonight @ took GS to final min
@talkhoops This is a highly unmotivating win as a Hawks fan
@CraigSagerJr Would be nice for Millsap to not play like hot garbage on wednesday.
@talkhoops If you were to grade the Horford/Millsap combo today, it cant be higher than a C- on offense...right?
@peachtreehoops So what would you grade Millsap at today? Like a C- at best?
@Kris_Willis With how bad Millsap is playing? Make it a series. Him and Horford both really really poor offensively today. Gotta play better
Paul Millsap has played indescribably bad on offense this game.
@AndyGlockner Instant upgrade over Teague since the ASG too
Can Dennis play for Teague now? Teague has been just....just awful on offense in this game
@peachtreehoops That looked easy imo
@Kris_Willis millsap playing terrible
@Cianaf what if some of us dont care because people who mock drafts arent even remotely close to being right. Like ever? Worthless
@peachtreehoops Mike Scott healthy?
@_dgr81_ he was hacked
@ScottCarasik Hands of stone
@RagjUF this is the weirdest crime ever. He sets it up then turns himself in. Meyer probably gives him a gold star
@ThomasGoldkamp this feels normal actually. Seems like every new HC has to deal with a guy commuting a big crime of some sort
@ScottCarasik Just the other day I wanted to follow someone for cutting me off but i had to remember the wife and kid were in the car
@ScottCarasik Not worse than me
@BrittMcHenry Also this is a solid job the ESPN PR team did because you clearly aren't intelligent enough to write this
@BrittMcHenry Now take off all the makeup and gain 40 pounds and see if you still have a job in the future sweetheart
@SAF4SAFF Madden has been shit for a long time. You spend $60 on a roster and uniform update
@ScottCarasik rather him than ray. anytime i see a ray to atlanta mock my blood pressure jumps by 400 percent
@HPbasketball Offensive and Defensive Ratings are still solid. DRTG&gt;Clev, Highest ORTG in April of the top 4 seeds FWIW
@HPbasketball Because 3 losses in a row and not really looking 1 seed like since the ASG. People forget Bud has benched starters A LOT
@justinlyntz @HurricaneStiz its us same like 6 elitist dirtbags posting the same shit over and over and very very very rarely talking CFB
@justinlyntz @HurricaneStiz i wish i had the self control to stop posting in that thread honestly. reddit /cfb is better at this point
@justinlyntz @HurricaneStiz missing nothing. thread is bad. no football talk. delta being delta. yellow vs shayner. its a shit thread
@JasonWalkerSBN oh you were being sarcastic. yay
@JasonWalkerSBN eww
@HurricaneStiz @justinlyntz CFB crew makes fun of you bro for not posting anymore. You should fight for your honor
@ScottCarasik Yea.....which would work too. I like him a lot. But I think Frank fits better as a potential Millsap replacement
@peachtreehoops Exactly. Though I will say I really REALLY wanted Kaminsky @ the 10 spot. Not sure hes there now at 15
@ScottCarasik Frank Kaminsky, a well coached Wisconsin product under Bud? Yea. Fail Proof. Not sure hes there at 15 now
@ScottCarasik Its realistically a drop of 5 picks. Which likely costs atlanta someone like Frank Kaminsky who is arguably fail proof
@nfldraftscout we are making a bold enough statement that he actually starts
@BuddyGrizzard Yea I absolutely do not want to play the raptors. at all.
@gatorhoops no please keep shooting the pacers back into this game
@AllKindsWeather #sour
@AllKindsWeather He posted so much dumb shit, like Will Hill level dumb I unfollowed him. I can only take so much
@HurricaneStiz ibyouscreenshotthattweet
@AllKindsWeather Ahmad might be one of the dumbest people in the state of Florida.
@HurricaneStiz I should make a comment that you screen shot for delta because he will believe anything
@saintwarrick @justinlyntz Hutchins&gt;
@justinlyntz Probably doesnt like my mean language
@justinlyntz @saintwarrick Andy Hutchins banned me from AlligatorAlley comments section cause im too pessimistic for his liking
@HurricaneStiz lol. im still so confused.
@justinlyntz @saintwarrick he's an obnoxious homer who rarely looks at anything objectively
@saintwarrick @justinlyntz as a gator I can get down with shitting on Andy Hutvhins
@justinlyntz wanna go when they kickoff
@BlatantHomerism yessir
@justinlyntz what was the game? like why was it important? qualifier for anything?
@justinlyntz im just kind of getting into soccer and i really dont know whats going on here :o
@justinlyntz what is this shit
@BlatantHomerism I dont think Frank would ever make it past Atlantas pick
@BuddyGrizzard So we need the Pacers to win now for the Nets lotto pick?
@peachtreehoops People seem to forget that the 2s/3s have basically put up 95+ points multiple times the last month in games starters sat
@NBATV So with all these important games on why am I watching a bunch of men talk about the games instead of SHOWING the games?
@CraigSagerJr While there are also a lot of growing fans on reddit saying "Man, DB, just retire for your own good. WWE isnt that important"
@CraigSagerJr for instance, WWE, Daniel Bryan is hurt AGAIN and there are a lot of people who want him to just deal with it.
@CraigSagerJr Everyone wants you to risk your life for a mostly meaningless sport. because really, sports are that.
@DaTrillStak5 thanks
@DaTrillStak5 I'm actually in the ER with you too. Saw you walk in. Hope all is good. Our baby was having seizures
@IanKenyonNFL kid probably played each game with a tiny bible in his back pocket
@IanKenyonNFL it explains why he became more religious. spending time around harvin, pouncey twins, cooper and hernandez....
@IanKenyonNFL @BrandonSpikes51 Unless you're a cop, you get away with murder if you're a cop
@IanKenyonNFL The conviction is actually fast. i feel like if this was joe smith your next door neighbor he waits 5 more years for this day
@FO_ScottKacsmar primarily ava
@FO_ScottKacsmar Solid, thought it was a little too neat though. With the way those 3 ran their lives i was expecting a death
@BuddyGrizzard Hibbert*
@BuddyGrizzard @AnaheimAmigos This and im pretty sure Hibbery, West and Hill were limping towards the end of this game
@AnaheimAmigos @BuddyGrizzard I dont like the odds. Id say odds are greater for Nets beating Orlando. Memphis still fighting for seeding
@BuddyGrizzard you shouldnt
@BruceWizayne Just started it
@HPbasketball So are the Pacers officially in? Nets out? Anything im missing with this ridiculous 8 seed race?
@BryanDFischer Duffys character is so great to me I think you could throw him in Better Call Saul and he would fit in perfectly
@BryanDFischer Wynn Duffy please
@JasonKirkSBN booooon
@HPbasketball I imagine they get it when Bud sits every starter tomorrow in the Hawks game
@BuddyGrizzard Also im sure the Hawks arent afraid of the 8 seed, or the Cavs for the fact. I am, because fuck atlanta postseason history.
@BuddyGrizzard Yea that actually is a pretty big drop. Bigger than I thought. So yeah, get your crap together Pacers.
@BuddyGrizzard Whats the projected drop in picks between BKNs lotto pick and them making the playoffs and losing in the 1st round?
@BuddyGrizzard 5 wins in a row with him back. Not the toughest schedule but still. Its a coin flip I guess. Lotto pick isnt that important
@BuddyGrizzard a part of me worries about them with Paul back. Probably silly.
@BuddyGrizzard I might be the only hawks fan rooting for the wizards. Am I drug?
@DeAnnaJohnson23 will you stop being so boring on stage. Your performances have the personality of an IRS agent
@TeamRankings I am really confident that a year ago I used your site to find snap count for college players. I cant find anything now
@BuddyGrizzard Whats funny is the 4 or 5 different franchises I started in NBA2K15, Milly ALWAYS ends up in NY next year.
@BuddyGrizzard Atlanta sports management is like my dad, they have plenty of money to spend on nice things but constantly refuse to do so
@BuddyGrizzard I don't know what they want, but based off the history of all things Atlanta sports? No, it won't shock me if he walks
@BuddyGrizzard That just seems very un-atlanta hawk owner like.
@BuddyGrizzard Kaminsky is about as perfect of a replacement for Millsap in the draft as you will find
@BuddyGrizzard I really want Kaminsky more than anyone in that spot. By a lot. I really have this feeling we dont pay for Millsap
@HPbasketball Who should Atlanta want to play in the 1st round? I'd rather play BKN than IND. The lotto pick isnt that important to me
@HPbasketball ATLANTA. SPORTS. FAN. Chilling is not part of our deal. People forget about us when they mention the pain of Cleveland fans
@HPbasketball Well its not just this loss. Defensive Rating is the worst its been since Nov. Guess thats attributable to all the rest time
@HPbasketball Because right now I see a 2nd round exit. The defense looks 8 seed bad right now and it cant all be blamed on no Millsap
@HPbasketball So tell me, a Hawks fan, how much I should be worrying about us having zero momentum going into the playoffs
@MrBrandonStroud Just go to a bar man
You just dont lose to the Knicks. Thats awful. This #Hawks team has no momentum going into the playoffs right now. Zero.
@JPSTATS Thanks. I looked back but I was looking for current college players. @TeamRankings used to have them, cant find them anymore
@peachtreehoops so for someone who missed the first half, how in the hell are we getting worked by the Knicks?
@kfc the lovely individuals at the drive thru completely forget to give us napkins and a fork. How does KFC have no tenders though? Terrible
@kfc so this store: 
2663 W. MAIN STREET
SNELLVILLE, GA

No chicken tenders all day. So when my wife had to settle on something else...
@Rowe247 Prison Break was the last show that got so bad i didnt bother finishing the series. PB was super bad season 6. Not sure ill finish
@dpbrugler Do you by any chance know a site to find snap/play count for college football players?
@NDTScouting Do you by any chance know a site to find snap/play count for college football players?
@nfldraftscout Completely random question, do you by any chance have a clue where to find snap/play count for college football?
@Rowe247 I havent even bothered to watch the last season since I thought season 6 was so so bad. Friends have told me last season was awful
@mavs2011champs0 @tomhaberstroh the best part about stupid people like this is that they always claim you dont need grammar for twitter
@DiddyVegas hero mode engaged
@geoffschwartz guys*
@HPbasketball i really thought he would be awful. playing a few minutes off the bench a game @ UCLA to declaring, i laughed.
@AllKindsWeather Depth is an issue @ LB but I really think our DL is insanely underrated. Starting LBers should be solid. Secondary +++++++
@NickdelaTorreGC this is kind of like the equivalent of a WR who exceeds 600 yards being the first WR since 2009 to break that number
@AllKindsWeather A part of me is leaning to 9 wins simply on the back of our defense. We only face 2 experienced QBs all year (UK/Mizzu)
@AllKindsWeather Ive faced this reality already. Looking forward to 2016. Return both QBs, return 12 or so OL, potentially only lose 2 skill
@AllKindsWeather Offense only loses 2 seniors after this yr, potentially Taylor + DRob. But still return a ton going into next year
@AllKindsWeather I just wish UF fans would come to the reality that this is a 7 win team, 8 at best. Its a throw away year
@AschoffESPN @DaveJonesSports Next year UF returns every OL but Thurman. Only lose McGee as a given. Could return all WRs + RBs.
@AschoffESPN @DaveJonesSports It would be easier if UF fans realized this is kind of a throw away develop the talent year. 8 wins= miracle
@ssallen1s @AschoffESPN @DaveJonesSports Probably because thats irrelevant to the point of his article smart guy
@_dgr81_ Depends on the quality. Are they even DVD quality? If so, then i may end up watching them tomorrow lol
@_dgr81_ MUST RESIST THE URGE TO WATCH
@SAF4SAFF My biggest issue with Gurley is his patience. I actually think Chubb shows better vision and patience than Gurley
@JerryHinnen im wrong. you were right. i thought i deleted my tweet in time. apologize. it was halftime
@SAF4SAFF lol thats funny
@TomFornelli We should probably remember that Spieth is what, 21 years old? Not experienced being in this spot
@RagjUF Today feels like a day where he either shoots 4 under or 3 over. He either ends it today or gives everyone life tomorros
@agentlinton severely need to add talent though. Need a RB, TE is still a weakness, bad slot WR play + Roddy in decline
@P_Woo how was mcallister?
@ZachAbolverdi that looked like an offense that has about 30% of the offense confidently installed
@CineFunk first team
 Really all that matters right now
@NickdelaTorreGC I figured that out after I sent that
@NickdelaTorreGC @TheSolidVerbal you didn't hurt mine. I enjoy pessimistic bloggers. Better than Andy Hutchins unlimited homerism
@Morgan_Moriarty of course he eagles twice and then follows it with a double bogey
@NickdelaTorreGC I'm OK with this.
@TheSolidVerbal @NickdelaTorreGC I find the pessimistic reporting funny since I've been banned 100 times from GC for the same thing
@NickdelaTorreGC he still hurt? What's his timetable?
@NickdelaTorreGC To keep yourself from the ledge, remind yourself that our secondary plays against a ton of brand new QBs this year.
@NickdelaTorreGC Yea its scary bad right now. But I keep reminding myself they have 5 more months to fix things and figure it out
@RagjUF "when the field shrunk you gotta play with that much more urgency and i thought will did a good job with that." Rewinded it to watch
@RagjUF He was not happy with Harris' play in the RZ, mentioned in short that on the flip side Grier on the other hand played well
@RagjUF The last sentence kind of hinted at that
@AverageGatorGuy im tempted to say 8-4 is a miracle but our D is good, secondary is silly good and we play against basically no exp QBs
@SAF4SAFF And luckily we play against really no experienced QBs. Like zero off the top of my head. Might be a lot of 17-14 final scores
@SAF4SAFF i actually think our entire D will be top 3 in the SEC. The problem is LB depth sucks but everything else is fine
@SAF4SAFF The only reason Florida wins 7-8 games will be because of our secondary
@SAF4SAFF Yea its sad. Thanks Muschamp for piss poor recruiting on the OL every single year he was here
@RagjUF I feel like its going to take some kind of coaching miracle for this team to win 8 games with this OL
I dont really see what can be accomplished by having the first teams playing against walkons and not against each other.
@JesseReSimonton Exactly. Dont get this at all.
@AlligatorArmy yea im a little confused why the first teams arent going against each other and why its like 1s vs walkons
@ScottCarasik I like to think i stay on top of all football things but ive never bothered with sparq. where can i learn sparq
@ScottCarasik Like, I dislike him so badly that I might boycott the Falcons all year if they draft the guy. I think he will fail badly
@ScottCarasik Shane Ray is the guy I hate more than any other player in this draft of potential guys that could end up here
@nfldraftscout No 2018 no care tho
@ScottCarasik maybe. How bad can I laugh @ TD if he passes over maxx IF he drops to us in the 2nd?
@ScottCarasik in a pretty solid TE draft compared to the past few years But instead he racks up on washed up vet TEs. Its amazing
@ScottCarasik Im going to shit on the guy for how hes handled this TE situation this offseason since its looking like hes not taking one
@ScottCarasik I dont expect a hit every pick, but it would be nice to not look through his drafts and laugh at how bad all but 1 or 2 are
@ScottCarasik you are literally the only person i have ever in my life seen praise Dimitroff. Literally the only person
@ScottCarasik Its not just the drafts though, his FA hit rate might be lower than his draft hit rate and he over pays for those mistakes
@ScottCarasik The decision to keep him around was as confusing to me as it was when the Braves kept Gonzo around for another year
@ScottCarasik its a really truly cringeworthy experience looking back at TD drafts though.
@ScottCarasik its a shame dimitroff throws darts at a board from 2 and on
@peachtreehoops so what punishment you imagine we looking at here?
@AllbrightNFL I know. Still ranting. Ita just something a dumb person would say.
@AllbrightNFL describing a guy as having unlimited upside is a pet peeve. Everyone has an upside limited to a certain point. So dumb
@onlygators what's the opening timeline for ipf?
Remember when @SethDavisHoops complained about duke getting the anti ref treatment? 
@CharlesRobinson: Presented to #Badgers and #BlueDevils fans without comment. 
@SethDavisHoops can we mention this some more please? 
@ncaa someone should lose their job over this #FinalFour 
@GaryParrishCBS @CBSSports can we not ignore this quickly 
The officials in tonights game deserve to lose their job.
Duke fans don't deserve this
@AdamHBeasley this is what we call a knee jerk reaction
@AdamHBeasley yes because suddenly a few good final four and elite 8 games has saved the sport
@AllKindsWeather @ClutchLikeMJ he also runs from any kind of intellectual conversation. Probably because he lacks intellect. Room temp iq
That was an insanely fast half of college basketball
@VZWSupport no shit for brains its your tower placement and strength. I live in downtown Atlanta where I get full LTE.
@billsburydohboy @MatthewFairburn do you think ej manuel is a good qb?
@VZWSupport so me problem? I work in networking. I know how this works. 
@VZWSupport you see this image? That's the download speed for Verizon over here. You problem. Not a we problem 
@VZWSupport every single person in this condo (8) has verizon. All experience slow speeds
@VZWSupport since we got to Orlando. Again. For the 100th time. Its not a me problem. Its a Verizon problem
@billsburydohboy @MatthewFairburn what
@MatthewFairburn no coaching change will save ej manuel
@VZWSupport again. Its not an outage issue. Do your job. Open signal android app shows this is a consistent issue among all users
@DavidLeoni just go ahead and sit him for the rest of the regular season. Don't care if he can lift a building in 4 days. SIT EM
@DavidLeoni praise Tim Tebow
@ScottCarasik eww
@ThingsBBNLikes have you seen a video of this?Or we just basing an entire argument off one image ESPN posted like an ignorant idiot would do
@g8rphan19 @ThingsBBNLikes UK ranks near the bottom in 3 pt % and he asks Harrison twins to go ISO 3 point mode. No sets run. None. Ever.
@g8rphan19 @ThingsBBNLikes cals end of game situational game planning is why I don't see him ever making it in the NBA if he tries. He's bad
@ThingsBBNLikes remember when you were such a blubbering Homer you forgot you posted this? Times are funny eh
@ThingsBBNLikes @AllKindsWeather salty, thin skinned Kentucky fans who have a short memory. Half of the reason you're worse than #FSUTwitter
@VZWSupport 32830 Samsung note 4. Opensignal app agrees that your service here is crap. 4th place on their rankings
@DavidLeoni that GT game was rich. That garbage 99 yard "fumble" return for UGA I thought did you guys in
@DavidLeoni you lost to one of the most inefficiently awful offendes under a terrible coach who got fired two weeks later.
@DavidLeoni don't think I've ever enjoyed a Florida win over uga like this last year. Unlimited shit talking rights to uga fans.
@_dgr81_ @lateralus2801 @rich_roberts @ryan_balke @Shockticus hope they use that #2 pick to take mariotta. Massive downgrade
@DavidLeoni thankfully I grew up a UF fan so I've seen 5 major sport national titles in my lifetime
@DavidLeoni like....really? Perfect fucking timing with just a handful of useless games left before the playoffs. Scott back early too
@DavidLeoni yea me too obviously. I just get fired up/salty/pissy/pms like when it comes to Atlanta teams and the playoffs.
@FantasyQsLive harsh bro
@DavidLeoni I'm not worried about losing games where 5 starters sit.
@DavidLeoni realize that. Healthy hawks I'm nor worried about right now outside of teague who has been pedestrian since asg (minus last ngt)
@warluminous fans in general are just stupid. FSU in CFB and UK in cbb lead the way in their respective sports by a considerable margin
@DavidLeoni but many metrics have shown the hawks decline in play since the asg. Killed what optimism I had. So my bad on the assumptions
@DavidLeoni for me? Yes. I don't if its a issue of half assing it because of locking up a 1 seed early...
@DavidLeoni so if a team not playing well loses a key member its a safe assumption that you're going to see a drop in production/effiency
@DavidLeoni also the fact we haven't exactly played well since the ASG. Signs here and there like last night. But mostly playing above avg
@DavidLeoni its a really simple assumption considering that I live in Atlanta and most atl fans are borderline mentally retarded
@DavidLeoni yes that was simply magnificent ESPN quality like argument from you. Truly solidm write a blog
@RobDauster @kylemallen well since he said this dumbass comment he clearly doesn't know how dumb this makes him sound
@APfeifer24 @FantasyQsLive I'm not a warriors fan and this is arguably the dumbest thing I've seen on the internet all week
@DavidLeoni poor life of an optimistic delusional homer
@DavidLeoni something tells me you're one of those delusional dipshits who think Matt Ryan is elite, falcons are great, hawks best in nba
@DavidLeoni @HPbasketball yes because losing a valuable big who stretches the d is easily replaced by the combo of Scott/Antic
@HPbasketball @sn_nba RIP hawks chances at an ECF appearance if he's out
@PFF_Steve it seems rare to find someone who has this opinion of him. Glad to see this
@DrewRoc5 I think its nice of you to give your PR person access to twitter so they can apologize for you
@warluminous pretty sure Kentucky fans lead the way for most early tattoos done by dumbasses
@warluminous I'm a uf fan, never seen fires in Gainesville or turned over vehicles after any ships the team won
@warluminous most fan based don't burn their city down after a loss.
@warluminous because of the obnoxious cult level following. It's hard to precisely explain on Twitter without going 17 tweets long
@WillBrinson also not to forget how comically bad Kentucky's offense is as a whole. Horrid 3pt%. Bad mid range game.
@WillBrinson 06-07 Florida team is better. Just the facts
@WillBrinson much better offense involved in this game
@LostLettermen @kshields8426 bingo.
@LostLettermen its their fans. Really. It is. Scum level #FSUTwitter bad
@agentlinton still convinced that 06-07 Florida curb stomps Kentucky. Random thoughts
@FootballExpert things we hear every year for $200 alex
Kentucky has how many McDonalds AAs? 8? And you lost
@lateralus2801 good point
@YahooNoise I'm pretty sure there was an article about a UK fan getting a 40-0 tattoo a week ago
@lateralus2801 yes
 Exact same basically minus the defending of accused rapists
#bbn #bbnation you're a terrible fan base and you deserve this heart break. Enjoy the pain
Eat a fucking dick #bbnation #kentucky
Could the NCAA make it any more obvious they want duke and kentucky?
This game is just as fixed as any wwe match
@GatorZoneChris which is funny since they are one of the worst three point shooting teams in basketball
@WillBrinson the best part is while this game is great there are many articles showing how bad this season was. Really...bad
@WillBrinson oh here's the "look at this one great game out of 500 to prove my point" angle writers love
@JasonKirkSBN wait
@CraigSagerJr did the injury look bad? Missed the game
@VZWSupport @carly_sagan this really is proof of how bad the customer service is. It takes you four hours to reply to this guy?
@VZWSupport I would love to know why my service in Orlando by Disney is piss poor. Speedtest nets you at 0.16 mpbs. That's awful
@VeteranScout @ScottCarasik but what if someone is insanely shy and just not a people person? It can take awhile to crack me for this reason
@wotzka @chazmania37 @ScottCarasik @Cianaf TB has arguably the most talent on their d in the division.
@chazmania37 @ScottCarasik @Cianaf something tells me the talent, stats and his results don't mesh well for a "good" label
@chazmania37 @ScottCarasik @Cianaf so he's wasted how many years with a top defense getting eliminated early or missing playoffs?
@chazmania37 @ScottCarasik @Cianaf not to forget he has had an above average offense and an elite d for more than half his career
@chazmania37 @ScottCarasik @Cianaf while that's a valid point. He has three division  titles to his name in 10 years.
@ScottCarasik @Cianaf @chazmania37 Agree with Scott. Don't think a Lovie coached team has a lot of potential to go above .500
@Ashutt92 ostrich sized. congratulations on this new level of stupidity sir.
@BDalms @pdcsdaddy Does your mother know you use this kind of language on the laptop she bought you young man?
@pdcsdaddy @BDalms Why are we still arguing with a kid who doesnt look like hes hit puberty yet
@AllbrightNFL i mostly listen to only the best produced house music and from time to time ill jump into some Group Love
@pdcsdaddy @BDalms Every single one of them are talking about why college ball is in trouble and what needs to be changed. Zero promoting
@pdcsdaddy @BDalms And also, this is proof he didnt read the articles because the writers arent promoting their sport they are concerned
@pdcsdaddy @BDalms IE, Frazier (UF) is a great 3 pt shooter, but he doesnt shoot contested 3s like an NBA player does. He needs to be open
@pdcsdaddy @BDalms in college a guy comes off a screen completely unguarded and either misses the shot or passes because hes not a shooter
@pdcsdaddy @BDalms bingo. As i told someone else, NBA players constantly hit shots w/a hand in their face, but thats bad defense
@RagjUF I'm of the opinion that McCalister is going to have a pretty damn good year this year. I dont foresee us really missing Fowler
@Basedrum777 But I dont see how ppl think there is no D in NBA. Guys consistently drain shots with a hand in face vs college who miss
@Basedrum777 Youre right there, the officiating has gotten worse, its a softer sport than it was in the 90s, but its still better than cball
@pdcsdaddy @BDalms I had to block him, I just couldnt take the stupidity anymore.
@Basedrum777 In college a guy comes off a screen and is timid to shoot with a guy 3 feet from him. Funny how that works
@Basedrum777 In the NBA a guy comes off a screen and drains a 3 with a hand IN HIS FACE. But thats bad defense right?
@Basedrum777 I laugh at this idea that its all defense. No. its coaching. Its bad offensive sets, its players lacking skill
@Basedrum777 In 8 more minutes of play NBA scores damn anywhere from 70 to 100 more points total than college basketball.
@Basedrum777 I enjoy soccer. Pace is fine. I expect low to no scoring. Its designed that well, but the pace is fine
@ScottCarasik Ewww marietta is worse than this area by a lot.
@ScottCarasik Also for future reference stay away from Jimmy Carter. Their attempt at fixing it up like Ashford-Dunwoody? FAIL.Made it worse
@ScottCarasik 330-7 really is when the evening traffic starts here. I live in Lilburn, which sucks, because im 15 minutes from every highway
@ScottCarasik or any hour between 8am-8pm. its atlanta. there is no safe time to drive anywhere during normal business hours
@BDalms @Basedrum777 christ i feel bad for that poor women in your avatar that has to put up with your mind numblingly low intelligence.
@BDalms @Basedrum777 "shit" because they dont agree with your opinion.
@BDalms @Basedrum777 Tightening the calls in the lane. Bad offensive sets on the high pick and roll lead to a ton of passing
@BDalms @Basedrum777 Solid logic. Superb. It has nothing to do with teams eating up clock, it has to do with rule structure.
@BDalms @Basedrum777 Again, read the fucking article you legitimate retard
@BDalms @Basedrum777 But clearly these things called facts, stats, they lie, right? Because it doesnt match with your opinion?
@BDalms @Basedrum777 Why does it not shock me you have ignored the 6 articles Ive posted that bring up every issue I have.
@BDalms @Basedrum777 Surely im making it all up:






@BDalms @Basedrum777 Lowest PPG since 1952. Biggest single drop off in efficiency in college basketball history. Keep up kid
@BDalms @Basedrum777 You wont bet on it because your IQ is less than room temperature son
@BDalms @Basedrum777 making up issues? 






@BDalms @Basedrum777 @LostLettermen Oh wow man your sample size is the final four teams? Really solid. You should be a writer
@BDalms @Basedrum777 @LostLettermen I'm talking real time. 4 minutes to 0 on the clock takes well over 10 minutes on average to finish
@BDalms @Basedrum777 @LostLettermen We can bet cash on this. I can absolutely promise you that it takes over 10, close to 15 minutes
@BDalms @Basedrum777 @LostLettermen Seeing guys constantly pass out of open looks to kill 20 seconds is mind numbingly painful to watch
@BDalms @Basedrum777 @LostLettermen CBall has no pace. Efficiency is awful. Talent is shit
@RegionRat14 @Basedrum777 @LostLettermen I watch my team play, and the tourny, thats it. Still tough to watch my team play when theyre good
@BDalms @Basedrum777 @LostLettermen a game taking 30 minutes to go through the last 4 minutes? Solid. Super fun.
@BDalms @Basedrum777 @LostLettermen 52-48 scores are a fucking blast
@Basedrum777 @LostLettermen I agree with the guy. College Basketball is nearly unwatchable
@IanKenyonNFL What about NOS?
@MicrowavedRamen So its time to find the nicest picture possible of him to sell the public that he wasn't in fact a piece of human scum
@MicrowavedRamen This is like the standard "hes a good boy" routine everyone pulls. Someone who was a piece of shit dies....
@LostLettermen @PeardsHere actually i lied #BBNTwitter is pretty damn close to the cringe worthy awfulness that is #FSUTwitter
@realshaunking I remember when people talked badly about Teddy Bridgewater after his pro day. Pro Days are dumb, mean nothing in long run
@LostLettermen @PeardsHere Nothing is worse than #FSUTwitter. Really, nothing.
Well this Raw went from great for 2 hours to shit in a hurry
Just now starting to watch Raw. Guess I have to turn twitter off.
@AschoffESPN Curious about Fulwood. He showed some hidden speed in the bowl game when he was finally used
@CraigSagerJr everyone makes a mistake. this time a group of voters did it at once ;)
@CraigSagerJr has UGA ever been #1 under Richt? Like at any point? That seems like fun research
@RagjUF kobe will return to his insanely inefficient selfish form next year my friend no worrie
@AschoffESPN Luckily for UF the East isnt particularly experienced outside of Tennessee. They arent exactly behind a division curve
@MikeSilver im often called a hater by fans of the team i root for because im not optimistic enough.
@MikeSilver you really think sports fans are capable of rational, outside the box thinking?
@ChrisTrapasso @gart9426 depth issue is also an issue because dimitroff is just not good at his job
@AllKindsWeather @FSUWill FSU has never ever ranked ahead of UF in the Directors Cup Standings. "Everything School" though
@MikeSilver NFL might want to bring down a heavier fine than a 5th round pick to disparage something i would assume other teams do
@JoshNorris not so harsh
@RapSheet Wouldn't it be amazing if you cost your employer $350,000 and you kept your job?
@ScottCarasik "harsh" they said
@IanKenyonNFL plus $10 for a pizza and $15 for drinks im sure. 

yea ill stay at home
@TheFalcoholic yup. No running game. Decline of Roddy. OK OL, front 7 wont make the necessary jump. safety play. cliffs on problem areas
@Rowe247 @TroyandRoy21 Whats worse than backing into parking spots? Watching people back out of parking spots
@Rowe247 @TroyandRoy21 there is so much truth to this. Especially when you worked in valet for years, it really sticks out to you
@ProFootballTalk What's the square root of pie
@ScottCarasik @McShay13 Agree, Shane makes zero sense for Atlanta with what else would be on the board. I'd prefer Dupree over Ray
@Nissi_Icasiano 
@TheFalcoholic This piping thing really answers my confusion. it was basically because we were piping in noise because us fans didnt show up
@TheFalcoholic I was confused when the Dome sounded loud during Browns possessions when nearly 50% of the dome was browns fans.
@TheFalcoholic Well my point was is that our fan base isnt very loud. Show up late, leave early, get out done by more prestige fans
@TheFalcoholic And this is coming from a Falcons fan who thought something was fishy during the Cle game when half the stadium was Cle fans
@TheFalcoholic Crazy idea: If Falcons fans weren't so piss poor, showed up and actually got loud, maybe they dont feel obligated to cheat?
@ScottCarasik I'm rather fine with them suspending McKay, this doesnt bother me, just dont take anything in the 1-3 range please
@Cianaf But we still have no idea what size hammer. No falcons fan cares about Rich McKay getting suspended. We want draft pick news
@AdamSchefter And this still gives us zero information on the actual draft picks we will lose
@RobertKlemko you cant ruin this wrestlemania high
@deadmau5 I'm honestly proud of @ericprydz for not putting out a sell out trance set in that ASOT stage today. kept it real as fuck.
@deadmau5 @theEDMcritic wait so idiots are actually mad at you for complaining about how bad trash like @Krewella  is?
@FO_VVerhei its on right now
@lateralus2801 @xmasape @djstarion i thought vince was too stupid to do a cash in period tonight, took me by surprise they did it MID CARD
@lateralus2801 @xmasape @djstarion when did he call it. how u call dat
@lateralus2801 @djstarion ROMAN DID NOT WIN
@lateralus2801 @djstarion SO FUCKING AWESOME
YES YES YES
@ScottCarasik this is going to result in a lolcenawins ending
The only way this WM can be considered higher than a C grade show is if Brock wins or Rollins cashes in on Reigns
.@WWE you guys going to mute Brocks entrance?
@lateralus2801 bleh. that match was boring as shit until the stare down moment
@ATTCares Your god damn internet keeps going out on me and im a network specialist. this is on your end. morons
Ronda better on the mic than Roman Reigns already
RONDA
@lateralus2801 I remember when i thought steph was attractive
@wwe yo, your network needs to hold up i didnt pay $10 for this choppy shit
@ATTCares Hey fuck sticks it would be nice if my god damn internet would not drop during Wrestlemania. Or refund me the PPV amount u dicks
The little kid in me is marking out hard
Terminator HHH ok
@Bill_Riccette the list of rule changes to improve college ball is 5 tweets long
@Bill_Riccette The pace of college ball is painfully slow and it shouldnt take 20 minutes for the last 4 minutes to finish. Ever.
@arminvanbuuren yo shut the fuck up and let us enjoy Prydz set
@Bill_Riccette i like how this reasoning apparently outweighs slow pace and 54-50 final scores
@lateralus2801 while watching doe
@lateralus2801 listening to Ultra Music Festival over listening to these shit heads ruin the experience :o
@lateralus2801 I dont even watch wrestling anymore because vince has lost his mind but whatever
What the hell is this opening though, LL Cool J, really? Plz go
Wrestlemania though
@lateralus2801 fuck the big show god damn
@lateralus2801 GOT THE NETWORK
@lateralus2801 @djstarion @AIR305 Probably gonna sub to @WWE for the night here soon and then cancel right after Reigns wins
College Basketball is SOOO much better than the NBA that scoring is seen as this rare in college basketball
You would think that college basketball and soccer score at the same pace with how insane crowds go off ONE made bucket
@IanKenyonNFL I think Wisconsin/Kentucky is going to be really boring. Just a feeling because I think WCS locks down Frank all game
.@justinlyntz or the idiots who say NBA doesnt play defense because they score 200 total a game. My mind cant handle that much stupidity
.@justinlyntz nothing better than all the idiots i follow who say this is better than the NBA
College Ball needs SO many rule changes.

-Less TV TOs
-Less Team TOs
-Shorter shot clock
-No more back to back timeouts
@YahooNoise outside of day 1 this tournament has been insanely boring prior to these last 2 elite 8 games
really glad that kid didnt miss both
@RotoPat I am 100% sure he is the reason ND lost. Probably passed the ball 2 times total in those 2 possessions prior to the last sec. shot
@RotoPat pretty sure Grants iso ball 2 possessions in a row for ND last night was worse
@BigEventsTV whats with the 10pm start time labeled there? It starts at 7. I want to do this but.....7...not 10
@edsbs Stephen A Smith. Skip Bayless. Both at the same time?
@VZWSupport Use this link to file a FCC complaint against Verizon for not following the law for activating phones 
@VerizonWireless To file a complaint against Verizon for violating the law and not activating phones: 
@AverageGatorGuy College kids need 3-4 feet of room to drain 35-40% of their shots. NBA players consistently hit shots w/hand in face.No d?
@AverageGatorGuy Synergy Sports has done research on this my friend. Showing that NBA players hit more shots closely guarded than college do
@AverageGatorGuy 38-0 Kentucky rank 118th in the country in 3 point shooting. All that NBA talent, no actual consistent threat outside
@AverageGatorGuy And by that I mean a high majority of college kids lack a true offensive game.
@AverageGatorGuy This is funny. It only looks like everyone in college plays elite D because 98% of the kids never make an NBA roster
@AverageGatorGuy You must not watch NBA. Hawks, Warriors. Cavs average damn near 30 assists a game lately. Spurs. Keep up friend
@AverageGatorGuy This has been one of the worst tournaments ive ever watched outside of day 1 and this game.
@AverageGatorGuy Ive seen this like 100 times already on twitter and its old. People using this one game to suddenly show why nba sucks
@AverageGatorGuy these games happen rarely. NBA is still largely more entertaining than college basketball
@AverageGatorGuy @GatorZoneScott Richards...thats who I meant. Not sure where I got walker from
@IanKenyonNFL Dekker going to need a BIG game. I foresee WCS on Frank 90% of this game.
@GatorZoneScott I think the 06 UF team has an argument. Noah/Horford/Walker/Brewer can match that front court length/size/strength wise
@GenoEspn Grant really needs to get a lot of blame here for going pure NBA Star ISO mode the last 3 possessions prior to last second shot
#KentuckyNation still has the worst group of legitimate retard fans on the face of the planet closely followed by #FSUTwitter
Grant is costing ND this game. He's gone Harden iso mode without having Hardens ability to actually take over this game
@TroyMachir Writer picks one fantastic game of the bunch to prove his point
@MichaelDavSmith I know them mostly as the team that chokes early in the tournament and not as the team that ever makes it this far
This has been really really boring tournament overall
. @SportsNation Worst tweet of all time
@AllKindsWeather he wasnt getting drafted last yr. ppl forget there are A LOT of players like Frazier in college. 90% of them dont get draft
@AllKindsWeather He's insanely easy to defend. Thats problem #1. He cant get his own shot off. He's korver without the balls and accuracy
@AllKindsWeather also, he brings NO upside. Sorry. He doesnt. Hes a below average defender who cant get his own shot off
@AllKindsWeather There are 100 one dimensional spot up shooters and most of them arent nearly as gun shy as timid. and they dont make NBA
@AllKindsWeather He has no future in the NBA. I really cant figure out what made him make this decision.
Wait, does Michael Frazier really think he's getting drafted?
@KySportsRadio @johnP_hayes I'm assuming this is ridiculous because it's not true because it's coming from Stephen A Smith, correct?
@IAKOWNeil BUT ONE DIRECTION PLZ
I wonder how much longer the #Hawks have to play at this 8 seed level before fans have a right to worry. #hawksvsmagic
@peachtreehoops at some point you cant just keep excusing this level of play on rest or having a 1 seed locked up my friend.
@peachtreehoops So how many more games of playing at this low level before its ok for us lowly fans to actually worry?
@peachtreehoops so are fans allowed to be upset even a little yet or is losing badly 2 gms in a row cool since we have a one seed locked up?
@peachtreehoops on behalf of sports fans with expectations we apologize for not liking to lose
Optimism and delusion is a hell of a drug. I actually feel badly for people who lack the ability to think critically w/sports
@peachtreehoops is healthy and playing together in the first round. But people are spoiled and pissed off.
@peachtreehoops has looked the past month either. Which metrics would kind of show if im not mistaken. People will forget it when the team
@peachtreehoops I like Buds approach about the bench usage right now. Rest is important. But it also doesnt excuse the way this team...
@peachtreehoops But what did you expect? People are going to be upset when you look awful vs GS and then play awful D leading to this result
@peachtreehoops but im not saying the world is ending. Korver, Thabo and Scott should all be back together by April, be fine then
@peachtreehoops you seem more flustered than the people tweeting you my friend
@peachtreehoops nah....primarily my frustration with how badly the defense has been without korver. it shouldnt be this bad
@peachtreehoops if it makes you feel better im not sitting here thinking "oh we lose first round". but i can be concerned a TINY bit
@peachtreehoops @BTRowland i hate how people think that because the team has a 1 seed locked up its excusable to not play good basketball
@peachtreehoops @BTRowland and piss piss piss piss poor defense in the 4th tonight leading to a loss. its SLIGHTLY worrisome
@peachtreehoops @BTRowland The record isnt my concern, its how they looked overall. Blown out by Denver. Looked disinterested vs GS
@peachtreehoops My intention was worrying about how bad our defense has looked without Korver and how I want the Hawks D back
@BTRowland @peachtreehoops Yes, thats what I figured. But people worry when the Hawks have looked like straight ass for the road trip
@peachtreehoops True, but people can worry when the Hawks have looked insanely average during the entire road trip
@peachtreehoops 48 hours later, Korver has a broken nose and hes out for nearly a week. Overly cautious? Honest question
@peachtreehoops Its an honest question. Whats the deal with Korver? How long is he out? Westbrook had a fractured cheekbone and played
@peachtreehoops Whats the deal with Korver? How long is he going to be out? He has a mask, if Westbrook can play, why cant Korver?
@peachtreehoops I dont think people grasp how badly this team misses Kyle Korver ON DEFENSE
@SherwoodStrauss Morrow doesnt exist in this game at this rate if Korver is healthy
@SherwoodStrauss Its not just that, hes more intelligent than anyone else on our team outside of sef as a defender
@SherwoodStrauss Its amazing that he is the defensive piece we are missing. Its a major drop down without him on that end of the floor
Hawks fixing to lose 3 in a row after tonight and the upcoming loss to the Spurs
@AllbrightNFL by rule, good call. but good god that ball never had a chance in hell of going in
@AverageGatorGuy Florida would have gotten run out of an nit game by now. I'm glad I don't have to stress about these scrubs anymore
@AverageGatorGuy you need help man, I care I'm just trying to give you a shoulder to lean on
@AverageGatorGuy why do you have to mention Florida every hour
@AverageGatorGuy dude. You and Florida. Get over it and enjoy the tournament for what it is. You're like an abused house wife
@SIPeteThamel samesies
@Morgan_Moriarty sup
@AverageGatorGuy stop
@SethDavisHoops thinks ND improved on defense


@SethDavisHoops no no no no no. Northeasterns offense was so bad they made ND look good. Come on man
Horford and Millsap are both trash tonight.
@peachtreehoops Maybe someone on the team should like, guard Steph Curry. Like just once.
@peachtreehoops its amazing to me how often we lose curry on defense.
@peachtreehoops Its almost as if both coaches agreed prior to the game to run a heavy bench. This is like a preseason rotation from both tms
@ScottCarasik projected Magic starting 5: Dennis/Mack/Baze/Milly or Horford/Pero

that is all
@ScottCarasik Actually the magic number is 3 now to clinch the 1 seed. So likely in a week and some change you will see a lot of resting
@ScottCarasik They absolutely will, Bud has already shown that Pop style of management, which is solid. Magic number is 4 now IIRC
@SethDavisHoops maybe i didnt watch because i dont enjoy watching games where the total barely breaks 120 and i prefer  something like nba
@ChrisDobbertean they probably made the proper assumption that Miami has a bad fan base who wouldnt show up if it was a 8pm tip time
@falcfans @AtlfalCANchick We normally are the opposite. Awful drafts, over pay multiple guys in FA. This is a strangely quiet offseason
@falcfans @AtlfalCANchick perfect dream would clearly be having a GM who knows how to draft and keeps it quiet in the offseason
@falcfans are you defending TD? I cant figure out your angle here or if its just generally educating falcons fans
@falcfans look at all the guys who lost their year to a torl ACL because going high = flag. So...gotta go low now
@falcfans knee injuries need to be higher on this list. With new rules in NFL/NCAA guys are forced to go lower
@MarkZinno @TheFalcoholic until you realize that if the rumor started on twitter its more like a spark ignited by throwing a rock @ ground
@SteveInBrooklyn @falcfans Well, maybe 90 in "overpaying FAs"
@SteveInBrooklyn @falcfans If Dimitroff was given a rating like in Madden im not sure he would be given higher than a 75 in anything
@SherwoodStrauss @tomhaberstroh thats kind of big with the hawks around the corner
@Schottey @agentlinton i still cant figure out what leads people to think one guy retiring at 24 is going to end the sport now. 0 logic here
@lateralus2801 @AdamSchefter HOW COULD A 24 YEAR OLD LOOK OUT FOR HIS LONG TERM HEALTH OVER TAKING 550K A YEAR WHAT A SCUMBAG /dirtbag
@lateralus2801 @AdamSchefter the shit bag is basically thorwing borland under the bus for retiring for health concerns instead of taking $$$
@brianhartline @AdamSchefter @xmasape schefter tweets 12 months of the year, hard life getting texted what to tweet year round
@ProFootballTalk and @AdamSchefter are two solid shit bags today. Heel tag team duo at its best
@AdamSchefter keep running from your scumbag tweet about Borland. Can i get paid to tweet 25/8?
@AdamSchefter would prefer that you take the money over actually thinking about your long term health.
@peachtreehoops I guess silver lining is more Shelvin and Jenkins development on the road. Fans wanted a deeper bench for the playoffs......
@peachtreehoops Ouch. did the hawks release a full prognosis? Just the road trip or more?
@peachtreehoops I missed any news on Korver, im assuming hes good to go for Golden State but he will be wearing a mask?
@AverageGatorGuy If this team won like 7-3 the last 10 games? I would agree. But they were just as bad the last month as they were the first
@AverageGatorGuy I like you dude but i dont see how you think 1-4 more games would help when 33 didnt
@RagjUF the real question is, would florida beat any of them?
@MushchampsMob @AllKindsWeather english
@FlaHSFootball @RagjUF CBI is basically like giving a trophy to the last place team "because they showed up and tried hard"
@RagjUF Not accepting the CBI? Like that move. Billy not rewarded bad play with a post season tournament bid
@AverageGatorGuy Actually, UF wont accept a CBI bid. Good job Billy. Like that hes not rewarding them
@MushchampsMob @AllKindsWeather am i not homer enough for you boo boo?
@MushchampsMob @AllKindsWeather "listen you guys tried REALLY HARD and we would feel bad not rewarding you with something. So heres the CBI"
@MushchampsMob @AllKindsWeather Thats essentially what rewarding this trash ball team a post season bid to anything is doing.
@MushchampsMob @AllKindsWeather I bet youre going to be one of the parents who wants to give their kids a trophy when they finish in last
@AllKindsWeather I for one do not want to watch UF lose in the first round of losers tournament
@AllKindsWeather They need the offseason and for the incoming class to push them for PT so they step their game up. NIT aint helping a thing
@AllKindsWeather NIT isnt going to make Walker less shitty, Frazier less timid, give Hill a jump shot, Carter an efficient jumper. ETC ETC
@AllKindsWeather They had 33 games to show improvement. They never did. How will 1-4 more games help suddenly?
@AllKindsWeather WHY DO PEOPLE WANT FLORIDA IN? WHY? This is like wishing we got 3 more Muschamp coached football games
@AverageGatorGuy Its like....would you have wanted to see a Will Muschamp led football team play 2-3 games "cause it could help"? Ewww
@AverageGatorGuy its hard to see a lot of potential with this current makeup. so i hope im wrong but this team is puke inducing to watch
@AverageGatorGuy they also need this incoming freshman class to walk in and push them for PT
@AverageGatorGuy 8 extra games wont suddenly make everyone less awful. they need the offseason. thats all they need.
@AverageGatorGuy id prefer to not see them lose in the first round frankly. this is a world class bad florida team.
@AverageGatorGuy of have to actually improve in life if they want to get rewarded with the finer things.
@AverageGatorGuy Instead of realizing they can make a postseason tournament by being terrible basketball players, they now realize they kind
@AverageGatorGuy I'd prefer they get left out of every tournament possible. Maybe then they'll be hungry and angry next year
@AverageGatorGuy Thanks Kentucky
@AverageGatorGuy They had 33 games to show improvement, they failed. How is 34...35 or 36 suddenly going to make them get it? It wont.
@AverageGatorGuy Because Im of the opinion that you dont get rewarded for being bad at something
@AverageGatorGuy You go 9-11 in a bad conference AND have 0 impressive OOC wins, and you're trying to argue UF into a post season shit tourn
@AverageGatorGuy more wins means nothing if its against a bunch of garbage. Billy schedules OOC this way because the SEC is trash
@EdJQuigley @gatorhoops @GatorZoneChris Lol yeah I would say thats more accurate. I forgot the CBI existed until you reminded me
@AverageGatorGuy UF fans wanting us in the NIT is like a parent wanting their last place kid being given a trophy for "trying"
@gatorhoops @EdJQuigley @GatorZoneChris UF fans wanting UF in the NIT are like parents who want their last place kid being given a trophy
@gatorhoops @EdJQuigley @GatorZoneChris I can agree with that. UF shouldnt be rewarded for their play though. At all
@EdJQuigley @GatorZoneChris @gatorhoops Gators win 16 games, 9-11 in a bad conference. Luck or not, thats awful.
@AverageGatorGuy I firmly believe SOS is one of the dumbest forms of metrics ever. What does SOS mean when you promptly win 16 games vs it?
@AverageGatorGuy Who did Florida beat this year that was worth anything? TAMU and Arkansas? Alabama? Are those what we deem impressive wins?
@peachtreehoops Was i right or was i right. I said 3 starters a week ago lol
@AverageGatorGuy @gatorhoops also, lets not even take into consideration how awful UF would do in any sort of eye test. Puke
@AverageGatorGuy @gatorhoops Florida isnt NIT material either. If they get in, its based off namesake. Losing record, bad conf record.
Do people think Florida should have made the tournament? If they exist, they should stop watching sports for the rest of their lives
@gatorhoops @AverageGatorGuy So out of curiosity, are there people actually trying to rationalize why UF should have made it?
@peachtreehoops YAY FOR KNEE JERK REACTIONS
@BobRathbunTV relax man you sound like you're running a marathon out there
@peachtreehoops did the hawks hear me
@peachtreehoops We look embarrassingly bad  two games in a row. I thought 2 losses on this road trip was realistic. Now im not sure we win 2
@VZWSupport Do I choose Verizon, who is slow, or @TMobile or @ATTCares who is, like, actually fast and on the ball @ their job
@VZWSupport so every other carrier has a quality update but Verizon. thats telling. Also something to keep in mind when contract is up
@VerizonWireless is there a reason that Verizon is lagging behind everyone else on 5.0+ update for the Note 4? How do you let Sprint win?
@drseandaner we were lopsing this with fair officiating. we are one of the worst teams in basketball
@drseandaner they should stop insulting our intelligence and throw Kentucky jerseys on
@AllKindsWeather see
@AllKindsWeather I ser
@AllKindsWeather he is awful. Just an awful basketball player man. One good play a month don't make him a man beast
@pat_dooley so being florid
@nfldraftscout @saintsfan34 you dont KNOW the draft is average.You think its average based on tape. There is no certainty one way or another
@BlatantHomerism IIRC, he's owed nearly $20M a year the next two years. How many teams will take on that contract + trade picks to get him?
@SeniorBowlPhil You dont like Mike Davis? has solid vision, not super athletic but should be successful behind that OL
@AdamSchefter Crowded? Sir, I believe that is how the Saints RB situation has always looked.
@Akshay_NFL hitting the reset button because they were stuck in cap hell with a ton of bad contracts
@Jordan_Bryant13 @BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy you have to forgive me for the temper. i get riled up talking sports.
@SAF4SAFF as a hawks fan im more concerned about pacers and the raptors. Cavs? Right now? Lol, we got em
@Jordan_Bryant13 @BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy It bothers me too much man. Im sorry. He looks bored, disinterested and ready to leave. SO? GO
@SAF4SAFF theres a reason they are 1-3 vs Atlanta.
@SAF4SAFF Their offensive movement is a joke though. Easy to scheme against. Insanely easy. They beat you with talent, not team play
@Jordan_Bryant13 @BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy Last post: I wouldnt dislike this kid so much if he looked like he wanted to play for UF
@Jordan_Bryant13 @BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy His best bet is overseas for 2-3 years then NBADL then NBA if all goes right
@Jordan_Bryant13 @BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy Again, there is no basis for the "get better". He hasnt gotten better in 2 years here
@Jordan_Bryant13 @BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy I'll change my name to @Ilovealligatoralley for a full fball season if he ever starts in NBA
@Jordan_Bryant13 @BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy I've seen this dude turn from 5-6 feet out and look like he wants to throw it down. WHAT
@Jordan_Bryant13 @BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy This is a guy that went from lotto pick in mocks a year ago to not being considered top 50
@Jordan_Bryant13 @BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy Impatient. Weak. No touch. Can be bullied on defense. Average rebounder for his size
@Jordan_Bryant13 @BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy Do you even watch bball? Serious question. Because Walker isnt on a single Mock Draft
@nfldraftscout @geoffreygrimezz bad hands is being kind
@Jordan_Bryant13 @BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy That 2008 team was bad, NIT squad. Walker cant beat out a fucking walkon for PT in close games
@Jordan_Bryant13 @BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy He averaged 14 and 9 in 2008. But yea, him and Chris Walker are perfectly comparable. christ
How can people watch college basketball when real basketball is on TNT?
@Jordan_Bryant13 @BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy He found one example to prove his point. Walker has zero post game. zilch, none, nada
@Jordan_Bryant13 @BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy Speights averaged nearly a board less a game when he played 5mpg. Walker is @ 3 @ 15mpg
@Jordan_Bryant13 @BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy On top of that, Speights averaged 14.5 as a starter, nearly 9 boards on top. lastly...
@Jordan_Bryant13 @BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy except its not. Speights averaged 4.5 in 5mpg, Walker is at 4.9 in 15 a game.
@sup3rkal0n716 @falcfans @morelandmd  Levine was the worst TE in the NFL per any advanced metric in existence. Lewis = Upgrade
@falcfans @morelandmd I would be ok with both of those if it came down to it. Just a good TE class I think. Walford/Maxx/James. Hell Oleary
@falcfans @morelandmd you just absolutely can't go into next year with Levine as the TE1. Absolutely not.
@falcfans @morelandmd OL/TE/RB in some order 2nd to 4th round, just a feeling I am getting with them not going after a TE right now
@falcfans @Gamez_VN no he was moved from LG to LT prior to starting, Never started at LG
@IanKenyonNFL I really dislike marcus but it has zero to do with today
@BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy you must not grasp how tape works,. How fundamentals work. Try and come back when you catch up to reality
@BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy count all the bigs in college who have both of those attributes who dont make an NBA roster
@VinnyDeuce funchess, maxx, walford, james all start over him from day they are drafted
@BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy and why do you keep repeating yourself? Me and Justin understand english. No one is arguing with you
@BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy @AlligatorArmy Mo Speights had a post game, to a degree. He was lazy as shit under Billy. Walker has nothing
@AverageGatorGuy @BillWiles1 You can look @ NBADL rosters and 90% of the bigs will BULLY him around with complete and utter ease
@AverageGatorGuy @BillWiles1 He has the worst post game I have ever seen a player have under Billy D. His D is just ok
@AverageGatorGuy @BillWiles1 This is a major reach. Hes awful in every respect of the game. He wins battles by being tall, thats it
@BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy @AlligatorArmy And im saying he probably thinks he has an NBA future. Which he doesnt. Not even a little bit.
@ScottCarasik Hes not even worthy of a TE2 spot, hes the worst starting TE in the league and every advanced metric shows this to be fact
@BillWiles1 @AverageGatorGuy @AlligatorArmy Walker will never start a game in the NBA. He wont get drafted. NBADL is a miracle for him
@AverageGatorGuy Frazier bothers me. He's insanely timid without the seniors and the bad PG play won't help
@AverageGatorGuy last one. Regarding dfs, I don't know I'd he'll improve much. I think hes hit his ceiling in his career barring weight gain
@AverageGatorGuy Frazier has regressed at a scary rate and carter is average when he's on his a+ game. Also love dfs if he's back
@AverageGatorGuy the only guys I see really making strides are drob and chioza (so, not at home lol). Maybe Murphy. That's it
@AverageGatorGuy @AlligatorArmy seems relatively confident walker is leaving. Which I would be fine with. He's complete garbage
@AverageGatorGuy has nothing to do with billy and everything to do with how bad the talent is right now on this team
@AverageGatorGuy we will improve yes. But not a lot. 8-10 seed worthy
@AverageGatorGuy I hate being right sometimes
@ESPNStatsInfo oh get fucked
@icyskyatnight @TheFalcoholic @ScottCarasik The hope would be that Beasleys really solid Combine #s push him over Fowler to someone
@icyskyatnight @TheFalcoholic @ScottCarasik 2 QBs, OT,Williams all go before ATL.Hopefully Cooper/White + surprise LB/OL too.Not a done deal
@icyskyatnight @TheFalcoholic @ScottCarasik Thats the issue. If not Fowler I think its Beasley.
@TheFalcoholic @ScottCarasik @icyskyatnight There is a 0% chance Quinn passes on Fowler. I feel safe saying this. He coached him 1 year @ UF
@MattHarmon_BYB @HankJoness I like him in the 2nd round frankly. Though if hes there in the 3rd I would like him in Atlanta A LOT
@MattHarmon_BYB Wasnt Harvin connected to NE? Harvin isnt exactly much more intelligent than Patterson. I know, I'm a UF fan.
@IanKenyonNFL Manziel is also pretty bad at reading defenses post snap. He got spoiled @ TAMU throwing jump balls to Mike Davis by default
@VZWSupport Thats no different than buying a $500 XBox One from Gamestop and then they offer you $100 while its still in the box
@VZWSupport So a Note 4 retail is over $600 but youre trade in value is $200? What is this thievery?
@MattHarmon_BYB screens, rub, drag, slant, quick hitch routes. All simple routes for even Patterson in that offense. I like a lot
@MattHarmon_BYB Somehow I think he would fit in NE pretty well. Hes a below avg route runner but with the NE dink and dunk O, should work
@VZWSupport Trade the Retail Note 4 for the Dev Note 4
@VZWSupport Im trying to figure out details of tradeins since you guys + Samsung wont allow Root. I want to get rid of the Note 4
@VerizonWireless So is there a reason i cant actually chat with anyone online? 2 Days I get the same "too busy" garbage
@ScottCarasik high reward seems to be a stretch, hes barely played enough to give anyone reason he will be anything but a career backup
@FBALL_Andrea Im glad hes off the market, as a ATL fan I was waiting on the Dimitroff 3 for 25 he would have offered
@ScottCarasik I dont understand you giving Person a B. Really dont
@ScottCarasik @bleacherreport required attachment for bleacherreport articles


@ScottCarasik @FalconsJAdams true
@ScottCarasik @FalconsJAdams no, you cant, but he has a clear history with it, which is worrisome. i wouldnt be concerned for a 1 time thing
@FalconsJAdams @ScottCarasik my primary issue is the whole only playing 2 of 4 seasons
@BourbonGhost @Adam_Klug @WillBrinson Why take the high road against @ESPNStatsInfo when that entire business has a history of robbery
@WillBrinson they accidentally stole something?
@Jason_OTC your site is getting hammered. none of the team pages are opening for me
@ScottCarasik because headlines and the media made it out like morgan left without anything
@ScottCarasik @vxmcclure23 i see
@APfeifer24 I thought he was a really good fit for the Colts, his running style fit that system I thought. But no point in that now
@ScottCarasik @vxmcclure23 why did he leave Atlanta without a contract offer in the first place?
@AllbrightNFL WHY
@peachtreehoops feels like a good time to go ahead and just rest the starters lol
@peachtreehoops the b2b is lakers/kings, but i figured sitting 3 vs LA and 2 vs Sac since we play GS/OKC on Wed/Fri. Long road trip
@peachtreehoops since this game sucks, you think we sit starters in that Lakers and/or Kings game to rest up for that Warriors/Thunder b2b
@peachtreehoops @ATLHawks_Reddit apparently not
@peachtreehoops @ATLHawks_Reddit today seems like a good day to give the 15th guy playing time
@ATLHawks_Reddit @peachtreehoops sounds like the best life. get paid to show up in a suit and tie and just sit on the bench for 10 days
@peachtreehoops @ATLHawks_Reddit so we signed him to a 10 day contract to not even dress him to play?
@ScottCarasik neither do I, but dimittoff
@ScottCarasik you just know dimitroff will throw a assload of money at Cameron out of fear of going rookie TE thanks to toilolol
@ScottCarasik I feel as if I'm the only falcons fan who really wants this team to take maxx williams in the 2nd
@ScottCarasik i just started following you yesterday
@ScottCarasik clearly i didnt know that because i wouldnt have tweeted that to you
@ScottCarasik cool man want a cookie
@ScottCarasik 
@ScottCarasik Dante Fowler please and thanks
@TheFalcoholic @falcfans Can either of you post the link for the updated Falcons moves?
@Cianaf hes going the seth rollins route 


@AllbrightNFL should we actually believe anything chip says? Are NFL GMs really THIS stupid to offer anyone a 1st for Bradford?
@YahooSchwab @JayArr_FF .....when youre rotated in and out of the lineup for a raw rookie kind of kills the vibe there
@YahooSchwab @JayArr_FF To a point, yes, on the flip side I would argue that QB play was so atrocious last year in the NFL that...
@YahooSchwab @JayArr_FF Did Jake Locker ever have a prime?
@adbrandt @phillygm711 trade 8 picks for mariota and cut Bradford obviously
@ShanePHallam it was pretty boring you didnt miss anything
@ScottCarasik would like to see some action on offense soon. Plenty of holes there
@evansilva phi trade up for mariota &amp; cut bradford?
@Jason_OTC is this updated by the signing? 
@FBALL_Andrea Thats terrible insurance coverage
@NEPD_Loyko Funny part is, if he buys into BB and acts right he would put up monster numbers in that screen/drag heavy system Pats run
@SmorgasBorgnine @falcfans GOT HIM
@FBALL_Andrea to be fair the only people who will miss him are the defenses playing against him
@CDCarter13 tormentor of WR streamers everywhere more like it
@jimrome Life Pro Hack: If you use chrome, download the TweetDeck app: No refresh, just live scrolls for you
@Cianaf it also makes no sense for the eagles to throw a 2nd rounder away on a below average qb
@falcfans He's an instant upgrade over any LB on our roster
@_dgr81_ thank god for that tweetdeck chrome app. except it NEVER STOPS SCROLLING.
@_dgr81_ thank god for that tweetdeck chrome app. except it NEVER STOPS SCROLLING
Is this the nba?
@DanielGillman as is the tweetdeck app for chrome. except it never stops scrolling
@SigmundBloom I think Jimmy Seam Routes will be enough to open up things vertically outside for whoever is WR for seattle
@SAF4SAFF I still want to draft Maxx or Walford.
@JohnMiddlekauff Lets see how they do march 18th
@domonics @mwnfootball even with in garbage quality i can still see the bottom feeding portion of humanity at work here
@_dgr81_ $1800 facebook machine fuck yea
@CDCarter13 plz reply
@ShanePHallam I took him in the 2nd round for Atlanta in a mock draft before that combine too.
@TheFalcoholic *looks at defense*

burn it all to the ground
@MikeClayNFL surprised at his decision not to enter FA. Teams like Atlanta would have paid higher than his market price for him
@AtlantaFalcons How about an internship in the area of computer networking? That would be excellent
@Cianaf Has he given anyone reason to like him outside of an outlier game once or twice a season?
@utorrent if we are lucky you get a class action lawsuit placed against you, no different than what @lenovo just got caught for. Scumbags
@utorrent Youre software is garbage. I think everyone should know its malware and built in with bitcoin miners.
@ChrisLaw @FBALL_Andrea yea harvin isnt going to be on that roster in a week
@DougKyedNESN You think its amazing that stupid people exist on Twitter?
BUCKETS
@jroccdaspot @peachtreehoops Bazemore, Jenkins and Mack will all get playing time at the 2/3 spot over him. So this confuses me greatly
@jroccdaspot @peachtreehoops Honestly I dont get the signing at all unless they feel like Thabo wont be back as soon as they though
@phr34k growing. figuring stuff out. not sleeping for shit at night
@L_Bell26 @EricOreoJohnson @RyFo18 mike mayocks accuracy is comparable to andy daltons in prime time games
@chrisdimino There really shouldnt be any pain for UGA fans, kind of silly to build yourself up to thinking you were going to beat this team
@GaSportsCraze Why yes I was thank you very much
@phr34k Its really easy with georgia fans though. Really takes no effort. I can do it while holding a baby in one arm
@arthur_ON_FLeeK @AllbrightNFL ya u r gay?
@MattNorlander where the games take 5 hours to finish
@phr34k why do i rile people up so easily tim, just why
@arthur_ON_FLeeK @AllbrightNFL your*
@GaSportsCraze Im sure you write spectacular articles with well backed logical thinking backing them with hot takes like this
@GaSportsCraze wow. This is amazing. Apparently you forgot how well Kentucky fans travel. didnt hear the "Go Big Blue" did you
@GaSportsCraze @phr34k So you're fall back plan is pointing out a stupidity in grammar but failing to show why UGA has a solid bball backing
@GaSportsCraze @phr34k WHOOPS
@AverageGatorGuy but i wasnt wrong on their season long record which UF did nothing but make me regret being right about
@AverageGatorGuy I said they lose between 12-15, I wasnt wrong. The only thing I was wrong about was them losing out.
@GaSportsCraze @phr34k also helps form my opinion when i try having a BBall convo w/UGA fans and nearly all of them say "I only watch fball"
@GaSportsCraze @phr34k and ive been to a few UGA games where i was free to roam around and sit wherever i wanted to
@GaSportsCraze @phr34k Because certaintaly someone who covers the school wont be completely delusionally biased towards defending it
@GaSportsCraze @phr34k 84/89/74 the last three years.
@GaSportsCraze @phr34k The attendance numbers kind of do a good job backing up my claims of the laughable backing UGA has for BBall
Florida/TAMU game is evidence #1 why College Ball needs rule changes across the board. This is miserable to watch. 20 minutes to play 3
@GaSportsCraze @phr34k Ive held this convo with a lot of UGA fans, a lot, and the general consensus is "i only root for football"
@GaSportsCraze @phr34k 80%, 70%, either way a majority of UGA fans have no clue basketball even exists until games like this arrive
@phr34k @GaSportsCraze be willing to bet you that well over 90% of the georgia fan base didnt know they had a game vs Kentucky at all
@phr34k @GaSportsCraze so many georgia fans realizing they had an above average basketball team for the first time tonight
@onlygators tonight? been a year long problem good sir
I love you billy but how do you have two PGs who are 50% at the line? Thats inexcusable
@peachtreehoops Its nice that Teague can sit for 8 game minutes in the third and rest for a 4th quarter run because of how good Dennis is
@peachtreehoops great situation. its fun that im not going "oh damn here comes dennis", its more of a "oh hell yes here comes dennis"
@peachtreehoops Thats where im going with it. I love teague, love him. But for the future? Right now? 3 years down the line? Give me DS
@peachtreehoops thats true. But you see where im going with my thought process in the least? Compare the two 2 years in
@peachtreehoops plus Dennis has shown more potential at this point in his career than Teague did at the same point. interesting to see
@peachtreehoops This is where my mind wanders to mostly. A trade of Teague, keep Dennis because he is younger
@peachtreehoops There is essentially no drop off when Teague sits, hes insanely talented so part of me worries he wont be in ATL in 3 yrs
@peachtreehoops On another note, I am legit curious over your opinion on what you believe ATL does with Dennis when his contract ends
@peachtreehoops "so bad" is harsh. ill end it there. hes an offensive liability and average as a post rebounder/defender.
@peachtreehoops I guess in summary, im irrationally taking my frustrations out on the rest of this team because of how bad pero is
@peachtreehoops arguing/debating/conversing, whatever term you agree to
@peachtreehoops because youre a hawks blogger and i thought we were having a civil argument
@peachtreehoops when he plays. moose doesnt show the ability to shoot brick after brick.
@peachtreehoops And yes, I trust Bud, but I cant wrap my little mind around Antic getting playing time when Moose is more selective
@peachtreehoops For every long three he miraculously drains he bricks 5 more and kills the Hawks momentum. What is to like?Serious question
@peachtreehoops Shooting confidence? I have no idea. Im thinking off the top of my head. Anything that gets him off the court
@peachtreehoops If Bud is so comfy with the east lead, why not develop Moose and aim for confidence booster for Antic instead of...this?
@peachtreehoops I mostly dont get why Antic doesnt see DLeague time for a week or two and Moose takes his minutes for experience right now
@peachtreehoops @jroccdaspot @jake_miller44 @LewHenry with what? Playoffs? Not likely. If we lose it wont be just because of our bigs
@peachtreehoops @jroccdaspot @jake_miller44 @LewHenry Which obviously doesnt matter. Bud knows more than me. But im not optimistic
@peachtreehoops @jroccdaspot @jake_miller44 @LewHenry Antic is next door neighbor with Josh Smith bad on offense lately
@peachtreehoops @jroccdaspot @jake_miller44 @LewHenry I dont necessarily disagree with this but I seriously cant stand Antic on the court
@peachtreehoops @jroccdaspot @jake_miller44 @LewHenry Toronto absolutely man handled us with a healthy lineup. Not sure i like that in 7
@peachtreehoops @jroccdaspot @jake_miller44 @LewHenry Yes, in the regular season. Are you confident in our big rotation in a 7 gm series?
@peachtreehoops @jroccdaspot @jake_miller44 @LewHenry Antic isnt exactly the smartest guy in the world. He isnt bad, but hes not great
@peachtreehoops @jroccdaspot @jake_miller44 @LewHenry Find me a big available right now who ATL could find since they neglected to trade
Sad to see it took this long into the season for Florida to play with any energy or fire
@peachtreehoops @jroccdaspot @jake_miller44 @LewHenry Team severely needs some better big man depth. Antic/Scott is it, thats worrisome
@peachtreehoops @jroccdaspot @jake_miller44 @LewHenry Who else is available? Moose keeps getting sent down, sign someone like McGee
Im shocked Alex Murphy is not being completely useless
@jroccdaspot @jake_miller44 @peachtreehoops @LewHenry nope. Delusional to think otherwise
@DrewHellriegel1 when you have guys like maxx, walford and funchess you dont settle for volger
@DrewHellriegel1 His tape is average, he isnt used but in mostly run blocking situations at alabama, no thanks
@jroccdaspot @jake_miller44 @peachtreehoops @LewHenry This team vs Memphis if by some MIRACLE we get to the finals? Lol RIP Hawks
@jroccdaspot @jake_miller44 @peachtreehoops @LewHenry exactly. its easy to win one game. try lasting 6 or 7 vs Toronto
@jake_miller44 @jroccdaspot @peachtreehoops @LewHenry We have our solid games, yes. But the issues are showing more recently
@jroccdaspot @peachtreehoops @jake_miller44 @LewHenry I was hoping to turn the Minny 1st into a true low post big of some kind
@jroccdaspot @peachtreehoops @jake_miller44 @LewHenry And the issue at the deadline wasnt prideful, Bud didnt want to mess w/team chemistry
@jroccdaspot @peachtreehoops @jake_miller44 @LewHenry Millsap is more my concern in the playoffs vs a powerful 4, say, in toronto
@jroccdaspot @peachtreehoops @jake_miller44 @LewHenry position standards are gone now. Horford is fine as a 5.
@peachtreehoops @jake_miller44 @LewHenry Memphis, Houston right now, Detroit are a few examples of bigs who bully Horford and Millsap
@jroccdaspot @peachtreehoops @jake_miller44 @LewHenry its sad. really. Horford and Millsap are soft as tissue vs true bigs. Fact
@DrewHellriegel1 a highlight video doesnt tell the whole story. its easier to ask when was the last time a relevant TE left alabama
@TomasKesete @SpencerThoreau why am i going to rehash everything ive already stated and you  ignored?
@peachtreehoops @jroccdaspot @jake_miller44 @LewHenry antic and scott as the big rotation wont really take you very far in the playoffs
@peachtreehoops @jroccdaspot @jake_miller44 @LewHenry to be fair, the team needed to add a big man at the trade deadline and didnt
@SpencerThoreau @TomasKesete yes
@SpencerThoreau @TomasKesete is being a completely ridiculous moron a full-time job for you? I know the answer to this
@TomasKesete @SpencerThoreau you said he wasnt athletic, i pointed out he was. 1+1=2 dipshit?
@peachtreehoops team playing with embarrassing energy after 3 days of rest
@SpencerThoreau @TomasKesete reading comprehension = d-
@SpencerThoreau @TomasKesete solid job following the conversation
@DrewHellriegel1 @TheFalcoholic yes atlanta should sign an UDFA TE who isnt even used at alabama
@DrewHellriegel1 @TheFalcoholic plz go
@SIPeteThamel 30 seconds of watching college kids with a quarter the talent NBA players have is miserable
@SIPeteThamel nba shot clock. 4 timeouts total. Both would improve the game
@falcfans is this a good thing
@TomasKesete having a poor blocking TE who doesn't help the run game would further prove my point btw
@TomasKesete what happened to mack is completely pointless to how Cameron is as an individual blocker
@TheFalcoholic last ranked per FO for all TEs that have 25 targets
@TheFalcoholic I dont want Toilolol playing at all. At one point in October Levine was the worst ranked TE in football per PFF
@TomasKesete Written April 2014 

not for this past season. try again
@TomasKesete that was for 2013 by the way, i wanted a full year sample size
@TheFalcoholic #1 reason I dont want Cameron? 2013 when he was healthy: JC ( was PFF’s 56th graded run blocking TE out of 64 who qualified
@TomasKesete Cameron (-11.4) was PFF’s 56th graded run blocking tight end out of 64 who qualified
@TomasKesete I would be ok with this is Jordan was a respectable enough blocker, which Maxx thrives at because Minnesota was a run heavy tm
@TomasKesete no one on the internet has all -22 tape for college. ive watched all his available tape through draftexpress
@TomasKesete reading comprehension is hard. Ive stated he has gronk like abilities. i never stated he will equal or surpass gronk
@TomasKesete Tons of solid hand usage, foot placement on the sideline, your fancy one handed catches, dragging def 
@TomasKesete Its like comparing a sophomore QB to Peyton Manning right now. Full blown retard mode
@TomasKesete youre currently comparing a RS Sophomore to a 25 year old multi year pro. Comeback when you can rationally argue
@TomasKesete seems pretty athletic 
@TomasKesete Maxx has jumped over guys in college. Im not saying he will be gronk, but the potential for a Gronk Lite is absolutely there
@TomasKesete biggest difference is Maxx only did 17  reps, Gronk did 32. So hes a lot stronger. But quickness wise, not far off. Similar
@TomasKesete people have a really exaggerated idea of gronks atheticism. Maxx has same hands, ran barely slower. inch and change sloer
@TomasKesete 
@TomasKesete he ran a 4.68, not a 4.5
@TheFalcoholic i still want us to take a TE in this class`
@TomasKesete maxx flashes the athleticism and blocking. hes easily the best TE in the class. falcons have no TEs
@TheFalcoholic i actually like him more than cameron
@TomasKesete have you watched his tape? No, i can safely assume you havent. Maxx is tier 1 blocker for a TE
@agentlinton the compare game always makes me laugh. why cant a guy just be himself?
@TomasKesete @option_perfect @TheFalcoholic go away
@option_perfect Only way im happy with Cameron is if he agrees to take a cheap deal because hes not worth a good sized contract
@option_perfect Cameron fought injuries for over a year, no thanks
@AlligatorArmy I'm probably high on us because of our secondary. I also think ppl will sell our front 7 really short.
@AlligatorArmy UGA only worries me because of Chubb but otherwise their QB situation doesnt bother me, neither does their D
@AlligatorArmy They return so much and have made small progressions. They really only lose between 2-4 in their entire 2 deep on both sides
@MockingTheDraft Better tip: Be wary of anything ever posted on twitter in regards to sports news.
@AlligatorArmy But im also probably too optimistic about Mac. I've sold him hard to my UGA friends in Atlanta
@AlligatorArmy last one since we are having a civil discussion for one. I like UF 2nd behind UT in football this year. UGA 3rd.
@option_perfect @TheFalcoholic Any of the top 15 WRs could start over Harry. This team has 10 holes to fill to make the playoffs. we are bad
@option_perfect @TheFalcoholic Just like any of the top 10 RBs would start over Freeman as a primary back.
@option_perfect @TheFalcoholic Clive is a great potential 3rd round option. There are 4-5 TEs in this draft who would start over Toilolol
@AlligatorArmy Yes, agree to a degree. Play better offense, turn it over less, dont be so timid on O and dont put yourself in those spots
@option_perfect @TheFalcoholic Really? Are you on drugs? This team has 0 TEs on the roster who can play. Maxx has Gronk potential
@Rideeout_ @TheFalcoholic I mean look @ the LBers people praise on this team. Bartu and Worrilow? Both rank outside the top 40 for PFF/FO
@AlligatorArmy I picked us to be 2nd in the east this year. SECOND. THIS TEAM. Way off. Changed it really quickly in when I saw the issues
@AlligatorArmy I have my moments. I was optimistic about the last 2 teams. I was insanely optimistic about this yrs team until 2 weeks in
@AlligatorArmy So:
Chiozza/Hill
Frazier/Carter/Francis
Robinson/Murphy/Walker
DFS/?????
Egbunu/?????

Too many options @ PF/C to say next yr
@Rideeout_ @TheFalcoholic Dimitroff cant be trusted to do anything right defensively through the draft.
@AlligatorArmy I see what youre saying. He's a UDFA in my eyes and is it pessimism if reliable sites like DraftExpress agree? ;)
@TheFalcoholic DE then the next 3 rounds in some order: TE/RB/WR. Prefer Maxx/Clive @ TE. I like Mike Davis @ RB a lot also.
@TheFalcoholic I also feel like im the only Falcons fan who wants a really heavy offensive draft after the 1st round.
@TheFalcoholic Frankly i'd prefer him trying to find 2-3 veteran linebackers. Kind of tired of playing the LB roulette through the draft
@GatorZoneChris Ok, no more me being a pessimistic ass. Serious question. Do you see Walker leaving? Does he think hes NBA ready?
@TheFalcoholic Thats the worry. I like Forsett and all but not at the "coming off random big year" contract dimitroff will offer him
@AlligatorArmy Truthfully the biggest reason I thought he MIGHT leave for is he looks completely uninterested in playing for Florida.
@AlligatorArmy I kind of assumed so, but I've seen him on 1 mock draft of the 5 I just looked at. Does he really think he's NBA worthy?
@TheFalcoholic I just want for Dimitroff to go one year without signing someone we all know isnt going to be good
@AlligatorArmy Oh, and I cant be eternally pessimistic when I thought the Atlanta Hawks would finish 2nd in the east. That takes optimism
@AlligatorArmy My starting 5 next year would be Chiozza/Frazier/Robinson/DFS/Ebugnu. Only hill if he truly develops jump shot + FT shooting
@AlligatorArmy Unless Walker plays the Dion Jordan "easy layups off assists" role I dont see where he gets his points in the post. Impatient
@AlligatorArmy I just think Hill and Walker are helpless. Im being harsh primarily because of how bad I think those 2 are
@AlligatorArmy Not every player. I like Chiozza, I expect monster development by DRob. DFS is solid. Frazier needs more confidence
@AlligatorArmy I guess a team that returns as much as they will next year + adding the depth they do, I find anything more than 8 losses=bad
@GatorZoneChris Now it let me follow you. Not operator error, maybe Tweetdeck error.
@AlligatorArmy Lastly, I am FAR less pessimistic towards Billy than I am w/football. I trust Billy. I dont trust these kids right now
@GatorZoneChris Its a simple assumption w/ "Bye" and the fact tweetdeck wasnt letting me follow you. thats generally a sign of being block
@AlligatorArmy The early Parsons/Boytin teams for instance I thought highly of going into future seasons. This team? Not even a little bit
@AlligatorArmy I know Billys plan seems to be a 3 year plan. This isnt shocking, but i dont see the progression that ive seen w/prior teams
@GatorZoneChris We wont though, because you've blocked me and if you block someone you'll likely run from any wager
@GatorZoneChris I mostly find the level of salty by you is through the roof simply because of an opinion you dont agree with. We can bet
@AlligatorArmy I feel its not harsh seeing this team loses 7-10 games next year. Deeper? Yes. Less unfortunate? Yes. More exp? Yes
@AlligatorArmy Egbunu is raw. Walker has no post game.  Hill has no jump shot. Frazier was timid. Horford was lost. I'm wrong where....?
@AlligatorArmy My pessimism seems rather well grounded this time. Where am I wrong with a team that hasnt shown any signs of progression?
Oh...I dont agree with your opinion? Time to block you @GatoroneChris

Solid coward move. Sadly you wont see this lol
Its always fun when someone blocks you because they are too optimistic and delusional to accept your opinion on a subject
@GatorZoneChris im assuming you blocked me, the cowards way out. But we can bet. This team loses 8 next year. Minimum.
@GatorZoneChris you mean bad players thrive against bad players in practice? In shocked
@GatorZoneChris you and @AlligatorArmy  would get along great with your never ending optimism backed by coach speak
@GatorZoneChris How did that optimism work out this year when the team promptly missed every tournament known to man?
@GatorZoneChris Walker only starts if DFS goes to the NBA (doubtful). Walker/Egbunu is a good D 4/5 combo but thats it as it stands now
@GatorZoneChris He will be an upgrade over Horford on D &amp; rebounding and giving us the missed Young muscle. But he is raw offensively
@GatorZoneChris also, egbunu averaged 4.7 FGA/game for USF, so lets no act like hes trotting in bringing us an aggressive approach on O
@GatorZoneChris USF transfer? Yes I know, hes raw offensively. Miles ahead of Walker but thats not really saying much. Walker is awful
@GatorZoneChris the entire team is timid. even frazier was incredibly timid this year
@GatorZoneChris my final point? i trust my opinions over the highly optimistic UF fan I tend to get into this argument with
@GatorZoneChris Again, i called 12-15 losses, hell, even picked my ATL Hawks before the season to finish 2nd in the east.
@GatorZoneChris Ive never seen someone pass up open shots like Murphy. Its incredible in the worst of ways to watch him "play basketball"
@GatorZoneChris But more than anything, this team needs to grow balls on O. Coming off screens wide open and passing. Always passing
@GatorZoneChris Still will have a team that likely severely lacks a post game offensively barring a miracle happening with Walker
@GatorZoneChris Drob should improve the most, I assume. Depth improves a lot but the O ball movement is atrocious on this team
@GatorZoneChris Maybe. Hill likely wont suddenly develop a jump shot. Walker likely wont develop patience and a post game
@GatorZoneChris And the sad part is, im still pissed off despite calling a 15 loss season a week into the season
@GatorZoneChris its essentially a moral victory for a team that doesnt show much promise going into next year.
@GatorZoneChris Playing their best game this late in the season means nothing when they will follow it up by losing out &amp; missing all tourns
@GatorZoneChris fortunately for them Tennessee is one of a handful of teams these guys are capable of beating and did
@GatorZoneChris This team is embarrassing to watch play basketball. They need to be locked out of the gym until they play D1 level ball
@TheFalcoholic I hope. I dont want a guy made successful by Manning
@GatorZoneChris am i the only one upset he got his 500th win with this team? He deserves better
@TheFalcoholic give it time
@BenVolin only 4.3B?
@TheFalcoholic Overpaying for Thomas sounds the opposite of smart.

So it sounds like the perfect Dimtroff free agency signing
@APfeifer24 DraftDay lets you pick like 4 or 5 C/PF total
dear @comcastcares 
Fuck You

America
Dear @Comcast,
Fuck you.

America.
apparently @AdamSchefter is going to continue to fan the flames and not provide any kind of actual evidence to back up his click bait
@tclessard dimitroff. that is all
@AverageGatorGuy i have them losing out. easily.
@AverageGatorGuy Handing these guys a post season tourny bid of any kind is like giving kids a last place trophy for trying hard
@AverageGatorGuy the pessimist, the asshole that is, in me is glad. these guys dont deserve it nor will the extra PT benefit them at all
@Frank_Frangie so basically your average night of shooting at the line under Billy D
@AverageGatorGuy I didnt realize there was a thing
@DerekTysonESPN Honey Badger 2.0? Might as well get it out of the way.

@justinlyntz so i said ill sue them in small claims court over that. then i said "if you return my laptop i will sue you because you..."

hey #FSUTwitter 

Try not being full blown idiots for once in your pathetic lives
@IanKenyonNFL @NFLosophy FSU twitter hates everyone. The life of having a low IQ
@LostLettermen Really though Winston is a perfect Comp to Big Ben and I dont see why any FSU fan would be mad over this
@LostLettermen Im actually surprised by how slow he ran, he looks faster in games.
@IanKenyonNFL @NFLosophy Cam is far too inconsistent to be considered "way more talented". Better runner? Sure.
@IanKenyonNFL I dont like Winston, but I think he is miles ahead of Mariota as a QB
@CraigSagerJr Hawks better stop playing full blown 8 seed ball if they plan on winning
@MockingTheDraft holy hell thats slow. committed to UF as an undersized "athletic" DE with a quick burst. Whelp
@FootballSavages @MockingTheDraft accurate
@AllbrightNFL you cant log off twitter and write log off twitter unless youre a bot bro
@DK_Thompson good luck on visiting mexico may you please keep your head
@AllKindsWeather That team likely didnt have a bunch of over hyped 4 and 5 star primadonnas on the team who were scared to shoot
@AllKindsWeather there is no possibly about it my friend, this is far and away the worst team he has ever had the misfortune of coaching
@SAF4SAFF I use FSGO to watch Hawks games at night when im rocking the baby to sleep lol
@SAF4SAFF STREAM. If you have cable you should have access to watchespn and the FSGO app. Both ways give you more games
@SAF4SAFF B12 was more exciting than the SEC
@SAF4SAFF i bet if you really looked him and leach have similar passing concepts. 4 verts + backyard ball
@AllKindsWeather make suggesstions? 5 new starters next year or hope they all randomly wake up with talent
@SAF4SAFF Well duh, Baylors offense was basically 4 Verts heaven
@nfldraftscout Winston&gt;Petty&gt;everyone else as a passer right now? would you agree?
@AllKindsWeather Yea you're better than me. Watching a team that makes me WANT to turn into an alcoholic? Thats when I stop watching
@AllKindsWeather its so slow, so boring compared to the NBA. NFL and CFB is so close in excitement and pace its fine. NBA&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;CBB
@AllKindsWeather bad temper i have, i cant force myself to watch it. but ive also quit watching college ball as a whole until march
@McShay13 would you say from a passing pov its Winston&gt;Petter&gt;everyone else right now?
@AllKindsWeather It gets to a point where they dont deserve to have viewers. I wont force myself to get angry at 5 bad bball players
@SAF4SAFF DIS FRANCHIZE SCRONG
@AllKindsWeather why do you still watch this garbage. its like being a walking dead fan
@SAF4SAFF Also he's literally the last QB of anyone at the combine I want speaking for my franchise.
@SAF4SAFF he is so far away the best QB in this class it isnt even fair. But holy shit that brain of his off the field.

@NFLosophy @datboywolf i dont like hundley either but its weird how you dont notice how bad UCLAs OL is when you watch his tape. its bad
@NFLosophy thats one of those david carr situations potentially. even matt ryan the last two years. hard to stay calm when you expect a hit
@NFLosophy to be fair, UCLAs OL was horrid. 113th in pass pro. 40 sacks allowed all year
@lenovo Im curious if I could file a civil suit against you for installing malware preconfigured as certificates on your hardware
@JaredCounterman in college*. And I could probably name 20 teams that he would be an upgrade over their current TE right now
@JaredCounterman I just worry about him dropping to the Falcons early in the 2nd. Really good TEs are hard to find in the NFL
@NFLosophy  i never for once thought mariotta could succeed in any offense over seen by Lovie.
@JaredCounterman do want in atlanta

very badly
@SBN_Ricky @ChrisDobbertean when an NBA game finishes with 60-100 total more points with 8 more minutes to play....yea...cbb ! = exciting

@agentlinton you have done a poor job casting when i sit there and say "OH YES FINALLY THIS ANNOYING CHARACTER IS DONE"
@agentlinton im done with it after this season. going to finish it out and then stop. i literally am happy over every characters death
@agentlinton in 5 1/2 seasons they travel all of 5-10 miles from Downtown Atlanta, in 5 minutes they end up in Richmond, VA. lol ok
@agentlinton one of the worst written shows on TV. Terrible logic and rational to anything they do
@peachtreehoops thank baby jesus
@peachtreehoops but only 4.
im not sure the nba knows what their target audience is
@NEPD_Loyko so what does reggie do
@AverageGatorGuy @CKurtzman only reason he hasnt passed him is because Billy doesnt start freshman unless he HAS to
@CKurtzman @AverageGatorGuy Him with a consistent shot and confidence and hes basically a more athletic Chandler Parsons
@CKurtzman @AverageGatorGuy I think the younger Robinson really blows up next year. His shot is really nice, just needs consistency
@CKurtzman @AverageGatorGuy on the boards that is. Ebugnu? He needs to by a 8 RPG guy and close to 2 blocks a game. Pure center
@CKurtzman @AverageGatorGuy next years team needs Francis to be legit and 2 freshman to be good and be good fast. And USF kid to be beast
@AverageGatorGuy @CKurtzman but your questions, his D is fantastic. His shot is not. Bench player. But a reliable one because of his D
@AverageGatorGuy @CKurtzman I forgot about him. We will be ridiculously deep. Billy can run 8 different lineups.
@AverageGatorGuy @CKurtzman i have no idea. im dumb. chiozza. i knew i was misspelling it and im too lazy to google
@AverageGatorGuy @CKurtzman I'm 6'5" and i'd bet that I could lock Walker down on D because it would be so easy. He has no moves. None.
@AverageGatorGuy @CKurtzman walker cant be saved. Thats reality. Skinny is the least of his worries. His post game is shit
@AverageGatorGuy @CKurtzman Hill is the only PG ive seen who teams wont ever close out on when he shoots past 15 feet
@AverageGatorGuy @CKurtzman a PG whose only plus is passing is not a PG I want on my team. You need the opposing team to respect you
@AverageGatorGuy @CKurtzman Schiozza has shown the same passing ability, but hes a more reliable shooter.
@ugadean @jppalmCBS might be an off two years for us. Not sure this talent can succeed right now.
@AverageGatorGuy @CKurtzman The less Hill and Walker play the more optimistic i would be. Because both are "i dont want you in pickup" bad
@AverageGatorGuy @CKurtzman Schiozza/Frazier/Robinson/DFS/Ebugnu. Dream starting 5. Dickerson main big off the bench. Francis guard off benc
@AverageGatorGuy @CKurtzman these guys clearly needed a new approach. ill be optimistic about next year if Hill and Walker dont start
@jppalmCBS @ugadean you could be florida

*runs away to cry*
@peachtreehoops dennis running at yao ming speed didnt help
@AllKindsWeather and the constant approach of "they need to work it out and figure it out" for 4 new starters? Thats a shit job of motivatin
@AllKindsWeather he did recruit this garbage and accept transfers from garbage like murphy and carter.
@AllKindsWeather some day writers like you will admit billy has done a piss poor job and stop blaming the players completely
@AverageGatorGuy @CKurtzman so basically. He needs to stop crying and fucking play ball and stop missing everything
@AverageGatorGuy @CKurtzman and a doctor will tell you that a sprained ankle is worse than a broken bone. Bones heal. Carter is lucky
@AverageGatorGuy @CKurtzman im not a good o player when i play, im great on D. I severely sprained my left, strong, foot. Never changed me
@AverageGatorGuy @CKurtzman like, BD, 4 new starters, maybe you should fucking coach them
@AverageGatorGuy @CKurtzman has. Keyword. I was worried about this year when 2 months ago he was talking about "they need to figure it out"
@theebigbossSS Billy also has done a truly awful job of coaching this year. He looks like he quit
@AverageGatorGuy @CKurtzman broken leg has nothing to do with having an awful jump shot
@AverageGatorGuy @CKurtzman Bad combo when he brings in bad players and does a really terrible job of coaching
Billy has officially done the worst coaching job of his life. I think he quit on these guys
@AllKindsWeather i quit on them 2 weeks ago. Awful. Billy also seemingly has quit on them
@AverageGatorGuy @CKurtzman Billy missed on 4 guys actually. Murphy, Carter, Hill, Walker. None of them will pan out.
@deets imagine that, weather changes. who would have thought
.@justinlyntz Deservingly so, he is a truly awful basketball players and just like the idiots who thought driskel would get it, walker wont
@APfeifer24 Yeldons running style fits the colts kind of to perfectly.
@ThomasGoldkamp You might not remember us exchanging tweets on UFs team, but I wrote my feelings to someone about it


@justinlyntz i ranted on chris walker in this allthatshit post about our team lol


@AverageGatorGuy I finally got sucked into writing out my feelings on this + next years team. Have at it


@SAF4SAFF yea but one can hope. alabama is like me in ncaa 14. WHY WILL I NEVER LOSE
@SAF4SAFF like to see how they do. new QB. two new WRs. No cooper obviously
@CraigSagerJr burr
@WaltelWhite @NDTScouting hes solid. Under utilized @ bama for sure this season.
@SAF4SAFF realistically i see 9 games tops for us. 8 is more likely. I like Tennessee winning the east overall.
@SAF4SAFF yeah dee hart put up big numbers under him. i like his potential. and the MSU DC we stole is very aggressive. Fits our personnel
@SAF4SAFF i loved duke so much. so fun to watch. i want perryman on atlanta badly too. instant upgrade over both our MLBs
@SAF4SAFF your man


@SAF4SAFF running game tape if you want that too


@WaltelWhite @NDTScouting Their running styles arent remotely close. Yeldon is fluid and can cut and bounce well. Trent? Lol never that
@SAF4SAFF thats why Jake McGee getting granted a 6th year is mega huge for this offense. Gives us 3 legit targets to throw to
@SAF4SAFF he runs a lot of stuff. Plenty of 2 TE/Ace formation @ CSU too. 
@NDTScouting When I watch Yeldon run, he seems like a perfect fit for the Colts offense
@SAF4SAFF Grier falls into that "ROCKET ARM" description which in other words to me means hes not really a good QB
@SAF4SAFF it is, for now. but i think grier fits his system better. Harris really regressed the last 4-5 games. So we'll see.
@SAF4SAFF i like our RBs this year. Taylor, Lane and Scarlett. Solid 3some. Funny how Will leaves, Lane gets start in bowl game. 100+ yards
@SAF4SAFF im just concerned about will grier possibly starting. not really a fan of him. hope im wrong. played against garbage in HS
@SAF4SAFF plus he turned Ingram into a heisman winner and won two championships with 2 LOL QBs @ bama. im ok w/it. happier than wills hiring
@SAF4SAFF Prior to the SECCG Higgins had more yards and catches and TDs than Cooper IIRC.
@SAF4SAFF Well, in short, he turned a bunch of 2 star OL into all mwc guys. No one heard of Higgins before this year either
@SAF4SAFF Also his vertical is insane. just google imaging gifs of hargreaves vertical is ridiculous. be shocked if its not easily over 40
@SAF4SAFF also, our slot guys are fantastic. return 4 corners + 3 safeties. stacked in the secondary. Should keep us in every game.
@SAF4SAFF i think hes more physical than hargreaves. hargreaves is better through the route but tabor bumps guys off their route better
@SAF4SAFF I actually think Tabor outplayed Hargreaves for the last month
@SAF4SAFF I could talk all day about our secondary going into this coming season. Tabor/Hargreaves outside my god. Not fair.
@SAF4SAFF That game still makes me salty. Real coaching staff we run FSU off their own field by 3 TDs
@SAF4SAFF He was good vs us last year IIRC. Or maybe that was just because he threw jump balls to Benjamin that he won all day
@SAF4SAFF I actually like Winston but I dont trust him off the field. The game against UF kind of worries me but...best sec he played
@SAF4SAFF into very favorable circumstances. Just not big on shotgun guys until the NFL catches up
@SAF4SAFF Also, the spread shotgun reason is why i wont buy into the NFL hype on any QB in Meyers system. His play calling puts his QBs
@SAF4SAFF Oregon didnt play Bama. Im talking heads up. And Im not big on Cardale right now but he out played and made more throws in that gm
@SAF4SAFF Until the NFL truly catches up with the 21st century I dont have much faith in guys who take 98% of their snaps in the shotgun
@SAF4SAFF I dont think its a "never ever" issue. In the NFL is out dated garbage. Behind even High School football you could argue
@SAF4SAFF In the CFB playoffs? Both OSU and FSU QBS murked this man heads up
@SAF4SAFF I counted 7 NFL throws for Winston vs 2 for Mariota in the first half before I stopped counting because it wasnt fair to MM
@SAF4SAFF He was out played by every QB he went against in the CFB Playoffs too. By a significant margin
@SAF4SAFF His NFL throws were because of how Oregon gets their WRs open. I really think hes going to bust and bust hard
@SAF4SAFF I talked to two scouts who agreed with me. Both basically agreed with me too on "the only true plus is his escapability"
@SAF4SAFF Look @ what TB runs, or any team in the top 5. Guys only snaps under center would be the victory formation
@SAF4SAFF Oregon made life insanely easy for him. PA pass at a nearly 60% clip, double the NFL. Not a lot of NFL throws on his tape
@SAF4SAFF Play a quick game. Name all the strictly shotgun spread only college QBs who have thrived in the NFL. Go. Hint, its a short list
@SAF4SAFF I dont like Mariota at all
@trollvigilante yes i will argue with you mouth breather
@NEPD_Loyko I really thought staying under a great OL developer in Jim Mac made sense. Apparently I was wrong
@NEPD_Loyko in all seriousness as a UF fan I cant even scout my own guys. Our team was so so so so so bad it makes it hard
@NEPD_Loyko you must be watching a tape of him playing vanderbilt or something
.@ESPNCBB @ESPNLunardi @BTNTomDienhart wheres florida
@AverageGatorGuy @SectionMZ So that leaves us with a starting 5 who lost 18-20 games and a bunch of timid true freshman. That helps?
@AverageGatorGuy @SectionMZ But freshman are normally timid shooters unless you find a truly elite one. We dont have a truly elite incoming
@AverageGatorGuy @SectionMZ The starting lineup likely is Chiozza/Frazier/Robinson/DFS/Egbunu or Walker. Thats my guess. Bench depth is +++
@RagjUF @gatorhoops accurate
@AverageGatorGuy @SectionMZ to be fair...considering Billys success with these guys im not sure im confident in 6 new bodies helping overall
@AverageGatorGuy @SectionMZ we will have more reliable depth next year. 4 freshman + transfer + francis but......
@ThomasGoldkamp also you may not reply out of believing im a on the ledge Gator, these are facts. we only lose the seniors
@ThomasGoldkamp But you think Billy decides to start a bunch of freshman + transfer over all the guys with experience?
@ThomasGoldkamp There isnt a single draftable player on this team outside of MAYBE DFS. Adding 4 recruits + transfer + Francis gives depth
@ThomasGoldkamp Totally new? Hill/Chiozza/Frazier/Walker/Smith/Robinson/Carter return. Unless you think even a NBADL team wants Hill/CW
@AverageGatorGuy @SectionMZ I thought he committed? And yeah I told you he was better than Hill lol
@NEPD_Loyko He was rather poor at Florida overall for his hype coming out. This is a UF fan by the way. He just underwhelmed
@ThomasGoldkamp im not sure when he will have the parts. This same team + 3 new guys next year is what....5 less losses? Tops?
@SectionMZ @AverageGatorGuy Tebow got worse. As did Driskel. List goes on. You either have the release/mechanics or you dont
@SectionMZ @AverageGatorGuy the problem is, you dont really develop a jump shot this late. its like a QB never really fixes his mechanics
@ThomasGoldkamp sad part is, i predicted a 15 loss season this year and im still pissed off despite me seeing this coming
@ThomasGoldkamp The billy d part is dumb, but this is a awful awful basketball team that does nothing right.
@SectionMZ @AverageGatorGuy dont even get me started on how bad Chris Walker is at basketball things. I could write 18 tweets
@SectionMZ @AverageGatorGuy Robinson and Smith are the ONLY two guys who will let it rip when guarded. Thats it. Only two guys
@SectionMZ @AverageGatorGuy Carter isnt remotely as efficient as we thought he would be. Frazier is very timid this year.
@AverageGatorGuy @ChrisDobbertean good thing you deleted @AlligatorArmy from the convo, dude hates me with a fury of a thousand suns
@AverageGatorGuy @ChrisDobbertean @AlligatorArmy this garbage is comparable to what our O in fball looked like under Driskel
@AverageGatorGuy @ChrisDobbertean @AlligatorArmy Maybe I have unrealistic expectations as a Hawks fan on what an actual offense is
@AverageGatorGuy @ChrisDobbertean @AlligatorArmy I really hate that I was right when I told you Justin that we would lose 15+ games this yr
@AverageGatorGuy @ChrisDobbertean @AlligatorArmy Well thank fuck there.
@AverageGatorGuy @ChrisDobbertean @AlligatorArmy These guys come off screens WIDE OPEN and PASS. Yea, that wont change in a year
@AverageGatorGuy @ChrisDobbertean @AlligatorArmy Do we realistically expect suddenly a year from now guys shoot the ball when they should?
@AverageGatorGuy @ChrisDobbertean @AlligatorArmy Secondly, these same timid kids will all be back outside of Horford. So.....?
@AverageGatorGuy @ChrisDobbertean @AlligatorArmy Size doesnt matter if they play as timid as these guys do.
@MattSmithCFB @rsl52 They have like 4 post season tournaments. Not sure any will accept a 20 loss team
@ChrisDobbertean @AlligatorArmy Sometimes a coach just doesnt put together the right mix of guys. Billy missed all around on these guys.
@ChrisDobbertean @AlligatorArmy The worst part to me is that people think a team that will lose 20+ games is going to turn it around next yr
@LostLettermen But then again I predicted on reddit a 15+ loss season so im not shocked by any of this
@LostLettermen Imploded is a stretch when you dont have talent on the team in the first place.
Some people actually think a team that is going to lose 20 games will turn it around next year.

That is what we call stupidity.
@AverageGatorGuy You mean the possession that ended how nearly every possession does
I remember when various followers of mine said I was too pessimistic and/or dumb for predicting a 15+ loss season for Florida. Come again
Worst. Team. Ever. Holy shit #UF is bad
@RagjUF @DanielM_ITG really? This is the worst Florida team I have ever seen. Its incredible how bad everyone on this team is
@SectionMZ probably bad basketball since that is all this team knows
.@gatorhoops 90% of Floridas possessions are awful man.
@lateralus2801 nba players would still put up 160+ total a game with college rules. Easy. College ball scores 70-90 less a game than NBA.
@lateralus2801 Maybe its just a coincidence i hate college ball more than ever and nba my fav ever. but college ball is bad
Billy taking a bad timeout? well i never
I have never in my life seen a group of college players be so god damn scared of shooting a basketball. Awful
Billy D should implement a new strategy when recruiting. "Are you afraid of shooting? Yes? Fuck off"
@gatorhoops Florida is afraid to shoot on every possession.
@AverageGatorGuy Other teams should just implement a "hack all of florida" and watch us implode the lead at the line
It should be required to watch Florida play basketball 5 beers deep. Even then I am not convinced this garbage is watchable
@7pd14ih33gb86 @SaveLindsey_Now maybe you can eat a dick
@Isiah_Ryan @falcfans Him too. I prefer Maxx out of everyone, Gronk like run blocker
@Frank_Frangie I think Zuniga has a better future if he starts off playing OLB this year. He already has the measurables for it, Not DE
@Frank_Frangie Zuniga is a RS imo. He is 225-230? Way too small to properly replace any of the departing DEs
@falcfans Please add Warford or Maxx Williams to this list of must needs for the Falcons. Toilolol should not be a top 2 TE on any team
@falcfans CJ Anderson was on fire the last 6 weeks of the season, Moreno was solid all year prior to that. Didnt help Pey in the playoffs
@falcfans especially since his play is clearly declining. When scouts say "i could see ATL drafting Amari", I think it proves this fact
@falcfans If the contract makes him easily cuttable,fine.But there is no excuse for giving him a contract that brings him into his late 30s
@falcfans 2018*
@falcfans whats the excuse for the roddy deal? he should have been given a 2 year deal. He enter FA in 2017. He turns 34 in November
@falcfans oh you mean like wasting money on steven jackson
@DK_Thompson Took us until Feb to hire a WR coach, after NSD, no wonder all those WRs spurned us a week ago
@GatorZoneFB @CoachMcElwain @NickdelaTorreGC good god no wonder we had problems getting WRs to commit, we just NOW foumd a WR coach? eww
@JohnMiddlekauff Kentucky could barely beat a AWFUL florida team. Step back from that hype train
@Eli_Marger So cliffs: Walker will never ever live up to his hype and I would bet any amount of money on this.
@Eli_Marger My point: there are some things you just do not develop. Look in the NBA. Neither Blake/Howard still have reliable post games
@Eli_Marger And lastly, you dont develop a jump shot. Prather never had one. Hill doesnt nor will he ever have one.
@Eli_Marger Walker is not patient. He has no post moves. He tried dunking on dudes from 6 yards out. He has no touch. No rebounding.
@Eli_Marger Walker is purely hopeless. I believe this. He played in a bad HS league and his coaches didnt develop him. Ask @justinlyntz
@Eli_Marger Young had a respectable enough post game. He was at least patient and didnt force it. His touch was just BAD as a youngster
@Eli_Marger The only guys I see truly getting better next year is Robinson and Chiozza.
@Eli_Marger @ABLichtenstein You dont get to take credit for a win but place 100% of blame on the team YOU RECRUITED AND BUILT.
@Eli_Marger @ABLichtenstein and as @rushthecourt stated, at some point Billy needs to take some blame for this team. Hes done none of that
@ABLichtenstein @Eli_Marger If Chris Walker wasnt completely useless his mins wouldnt be tripled by a undersized walkon
@ABLichtenstein @Eli_Marger so this is not new. Talented teams dont get dominated on the boards and shoot 50% from FT line ALL THE TIME
@ABLichtenstein @Eli_Marger Kentucky has been underwhelming all year struggling to get by teams they are far more talented than.
@Eli_Marger @ABLichtenstein how is this group more talented? Because they were ranked in the preseason top 10? A meaningless award?
@CDCarter13 ITS W E E Z Y B A B I EHH HAAA
@CDCarter13 so you listen to lil wayne
@rushthecourt none. Which he should take a lot of blame. No movement on offense, a lot of iso. Bad makeup all around and he just blames them
@ABLichtenstein Ill end it here. next year the best i see us doing is +3 to 4 wins. Thats about it. This team isnt truly talented
@ABLichtenstein The only players I see improving next year is Chiozza and Robinson. DFS too if he returns. That is it.
@ABLichtenstein For Walker to play 0 minutes the last 10 minutes vs a team his height is needed is example 1 for how bad he is
@ABLichtenstein there are NBA PF/Cs who still dont have a dependable post game (Blake/Howard). You just dont suddenly get it there.
@ABLichtenstein You dont develop jump shots this late in your career. Its hard to develop a post game this deep in too.
@ABLichtenstein 2 years, Hill still cant shoot. Murphy and Carter are the most timid shooters on the planet. Walker has 0 post game
@ABLichtenstein Love billy but he just flat out missed with this team. Hill, Walker, Murphy, Carter. 4 truly bad basketball players
@ABLichtenstein If everyone returns (outside of Hor) i dont think we improve much next year. Really dont. We are that bad.
@ABLichtenstein This team would get blown out by both the NIT teams. THose teams at least had a pulse on O. This team? Ummm
@ABLichtenstein they are 100% done. This is a really awful basketball team. I predicted a 12-15 loss season, looking like im going to be $$
@justinlyntz We are so bad that returning all but Horford equates to like 2 less losses next year
@justinlyntz i dont know how any of them start outside of DFS. This is a terrible fucking team. Walker is the worst 5 star ever
@ABLichtenstein They were done when they lost to Vanderbilt. You dont lose to a team w/conf record of 1-9 and deserve to get in
This #UF Gators team is so bad if this was the NBA I would be asking about trading everyone so we can start w/5 new guys next year
This team doesnt deserve to win.

Missed FTs

constantly giving UK 2nd chances on offense

dont deserve to win. bad bad bad tesam
@ABLichtenstein or am i being too harsh on a kid who was supposed to be a savior transfer and does nothing
@ABLichtenstein most effort hes ever put into a play before
@MattNorlander Florida will lose.  I assure you we dont win these games with this talentless squad this year
@NickdelaTorreGC play 8 less minutes than NBA teams and score nearly 70-80 points less total a game
@NickdelaTorreGC I dont think going to a NBA shot clock helps either. The college game is just tough to watch.
@NickdelaTorreGC Yea. But its infuriating seeing people say college kids play better D. They dont. College ball is really really bad
Chris Walker is the most wasted scholly in the history of this program. Playing vs a TALL team and he cant earn minutes
@AverageGatorGuy @NickdelaTorreGC College ball is iso + pick here and there.

how is that hard to defend?
@AverageGatorGuy @NickdelaTorreGC its inexcusable for Billy not to run Frazier through 2-3 backdoor cuts a possession. He never does. Ever
@AverageGatorGuy @NickdelaTorreGC Again, they dont. It seems this way again because college doesnt run systems or have talented shooters
@AverageGatorGuy @NickdelaTorreGC thus...idiots think college players play better defense vs inept offensive systems and bad players
@AverageGatorGuy @NickdelaTorreGC its hard to defend that much action. College? Easy to defend 2-3 picks a possession
@AverageGatorGuy @NickdelaTorreGC did you watch hawks game last night? Warriors ran 3 screens a possession for klay and curry
@AverageGatorGuy @NickdelaTorreGC College teams also dont run complicated offenses. We run essentially no screen action for Frazier.
Kasey Hill is this teams version of Jeff Driskel. More he plays the angrier I get. Kid is utter garbage
@AverageGatorGuy @NickdelaTorreGC and the defender? you shoot. PGs in the NBA dont shoot 63% from the FT line.
@AverageGatorGuy @NickdelaTorreGC kids are talentless as shit offensively. When you come around a screen and you have 3-4 yards between you
@AverageGatorGuy @NickdelaTorreGC NBA plays far better D than college. Want to know why people have this terrible view? Because college
@AverageGatorGuy @NickdelaTorreGC passes coming around screens even the worst shooters in the nba pull up and drain? UF? PASS PASS PASS
@AverageGatorGuy @NickdelaTorreGC I watch too much NBA. College kids cant play. Pass up way too many open shots. I see these kids catch
@NickdelaTorreGC @AverageGatorGuy Chiozza constantly has so much separation there is no excuse for him not shooting, he passes a lot
@NickdelaTorreGC @AverageGatorGuy Chiozza is already better than Hill. Right now. The only thing he needs is a killer instinct
@AverageGatorGuy @NickdelaTorreGC and like nick said he just isnt a good PG. He doesnt have control of the offense, even a little bit
@onlygators thats the gators i know
@AllKindsWeather The dude hates me but id be willing to bet anything that if you tracked me and his accuracy rate one season id blow him out
@AllKindsWeather im sure i would love him if he ever showed a hint of pessimism or ability to step outside of being a UF fan. he doesnt
@AllKindsWeather Going through his recruiting projections where 90% of his guesses were UF. Dude probably thought we had top 5 potential
@AllKindsWeather its hard when he gets to a point he is basically a parody account. UF BBall has a shot at the tourny. Muschamp.
@AllKindsWeather i dont even try to follow his rational any longer. i just read to laugh
@AllKindsWeather And he still writes bball reviews like we have a shot to make the tournament. How does he have a following? Delusional
@AllKindsWeather The fact he still found reasons to take WMs side just because we beat UGA really hurts his credibility as a writer for me
@AllKindsWeather Oh yeah i didnt say anything about his writing style. But he still defends Muschamp. He is a special human being
@AllKindsWeather Ball movement and made shots to no ball movement and a team full of guys who might not out shoot me in a contest
@AllKindsWeather Its really infuriating going from watching Hawks (lifelong fan not a bandwagon one) to watching this abortion of a team
@AllKindsWeather I skim read his stuff mostly because I like to see how delusionally homer he is
@CecilHurt AKA: Every SEC games total points combined for at halftime this year
@AllKindsWeather In which case I was both laughing at and not being surprised because Hutchins is fucking delusional as shit
@AllKindsWeather Im lost. i was being sarcastic by basically saying he is constantly wrong. I thought you said he picked UF to win
@AllKindsWeather There is no way anyone who is a logical human being that understands sports thinks Florida wins this game tonight. No one
@AllKindsWeather Of course he would, the guy is a delusional derp. He might pick Florida to beat the 76ers
@AllKindsWeather For like a week or two. But I wont have to worry about that. Probably have this turned off by halftime when we down 18
@AllKindsWeather id change my twitter name to something awful like "andyhitchensisalwaysright if we win this game.
@PrizeNow76750 hey suck my fucking dick
@AllKindsWeather not enough characters in the world to properly express how useless everyone not named DFS on this team is
@AllKindsWeather 0% is the only logical answer. This is the worst team since the 80s? Kentucky can play bored and smash us
@AllKindsWeather lol
@heathradio I live in Atlanta and I'm skeptical of most hawks fans right now lol
@heathradio "big" means fan  as of 2 weeks ago
@edsbs wouldnt anyone
@RagjUF poor espn for thinking this will be competitive.
@RagjUF poor fans
@DK_Thompson ole miss upped the price
@AllKindsWeather but daddy getting that ole miss money
@AlligatorArmy hard to ignore your 2nd biggest recruit not coming to UF because his dad is getting paid by ole miss
@lateralus2801 @ThomasGoldkamp whats funny is someone posted on a forum his dad is a huge UF fan. tag, tattoo and all.

yup, no money here
@MattWaldman My #1 issue with Gurley is im not sure how his patience translates. Think he depends too much on his strength. NC is patient
@MattWaldman I actually like Chubb more than Gurley. Not comparing freshman to freshman. I mean, I like Chubb more now vs healthy Gurley
@lateralus2801 @ThomasGoldkamp i thought something was up when ESPN asked him "you sending the LOI in now?" and he hesitated to say yes
@lateralus2801 @ThomasGoldkamp sounds like the dad already getting that ole miss money because they couldnt get the mom to jump on it
@ThomasGoldkamp that was fast
@lateralus2801 @ThomasGoldkamp Yea parents are fucking stupid.
@ATLHawks 
@CraigSagerJr this is better


@DK_Thompson @samerwin1717 UGA fans make jorts joke its easy to reply with a multitude of red neck comebacks
@DK_Thompson @samerwin1717 offend me? no. it just makes me cringe.
@DK_Thompson @samerwin1717 ROOF ROOF ROOF DAWWWWGS ROOF

FUCK OFF
@DK_Thompson @samerwin1717 hes not wrong though my friend. i always give UGA fans shit for how uneducated barking and spelling Dogs is
oh my god mike scott dont hurt em
@KennytheGator @AllKindsWeather that is not easy on the eyes
@jamiedukes context for Florida's recruiting class 

Ranked 105th a week ago
@JFowlerESPN if youre on windows they have a snipping tool. its literally called that. its a screen shot app
@RosterWatch both hopefully
@NickdelaTorreGC Win recruiter of the year just for what he did with saving Muschamps abortion of a job on the OL
@AschoffESPN thats because UGA and their fan base are perfectly happy winning 9 games a year
@Matt_HayesSN not far fetched considering how weak the east is and muschamp takes auburn to a new level
@BobRedman_Scout looks like Mac will be going after 2-3 QBs next class
@DanWolken 2 weeks ago this was a class that ranked just slightly worse than 100th
Florida looks like it will need 2-3 QBs next year
@theebigbossSS @onlygators also the whole winning national titles with 2 QBs @ bama who had zero nfl future
@TomLuginbill But smith has gotten up to 320. So i admit to ignorance here.
@TomLuginbill yea i realized this after i looked @ Tyrone Smiths #s, which is who he reminded me of when Smith was in HS
@theebigbossSS @onlygators i tend to agree based off Macs history @ CSU. Turning a group of 2/3 stars into all MWC kids
@TomLuginbill Maybe im wrong. I thought Tyron Smith played sub 300 but ESPN has him @ 320. Skinniest 320 ive ever seen. So i defer to you
@TomLuginbill Obsession was a bit much, yes. But still confused by the need to gain weight. He can thrive at 290 with that build
@DK_Thompson yup. more of a miracle when you think that they had to fight probably being the most negatively recruited against team in SEC
@TomLuginbill you realize the best OTs in all levels of football dont exceed 300? Why the obsession with Ivey needing to get to 320?
@IanKenyonNFL 
@RadiNabulsi no
@JortsTorture and finding a way to lose to 4 teams we have more talent then
@chrisdimino As a UF fan I would say if AU had Muschamp running their D last year they likely win the west running away.
@chrisdimino Auburn is better off with Muschamp there, yes. Primarily because Muschamp is a solid assistant. He is not HC material in SEC
@TomFornelli my couch
@chrisdimino and any rational florida fan would be happy for the tradeoff of no longer having muschamp run the program into the ground
@TheDanteFowler6 Also this will go unnoticed and isnt related but as a Falcons fan I truly hope to see you in Atlanta come September
@TheDanteFowler6 people seem to really forget the relationship aspect of this. He knew TRob/Muschamp for 2 years? Mac for one month
@YRN70 @falcfans falcons fans play up our entire front 7 too much. have you seen the average fans opinion of worrilow and bartu?
Hey #UF #Florida #Gators fans, when you want to get upset about this recruiting class. Reminder


@JortsTorture Yup. But the current staff has done great. Only 1 month to pull this off. This class was ranked worse than 100th 2 weeks ago
@bmanning96 @AverageGatorGuy arguably the best transitional job any coach has done @ UF. No one else walked in with only 7 kids committed
@ThomasGoldkamp @Bryan_Holt how about al bundying it?
@bamainatl1992 @FrontOfficeLos When the NFL goes to hand down their punishment to ATL they will just look at their record. "youre good"
@ABLichtenstein @AlligatorArmy pretty motivating to see what this staff could do with an entire year
@ABLichtenstein @AlligatorArmy YUP. Bingo. Keeping Muschamp for a #1 class is not worth it. Not even a little bit
@JortsTorture in all seriousness we needed him like, badly. Florida essentially has 2 QBs to use in 2015
@TV4JB @AlligatorArmy im talking about players UF has a realistic shot at actually getting. Not kids trolling Florida
@ABLichtenstein @AlligatorArmy obviously. we were at 6 or 7 commits at one point after he was hired? Im happy for this class.
@AlligatorArmy who else is left that is a "big get" outside of him?
@JeffBarlis Yea we should be happy muschamp is gone
@ABLichtenstein @AlligatorArmy at the pace today is going id be willing to bet CeCe ends up not at florida
@JFowlerESPN yo did you take a picture of your laptop
@FrontOfficeLos sit down and shut up, a football game is no place to stand and get loud. im trying to watch the game
@AllKindsWeather i thought auburn was getting commitments from 45 more kids today
YOU MEAN SOMEONE DIDNT PICK AUBURN
@SAF4SAFF Kelvin Taylor still here.
@SAF4SAFF Im a UF fan. Its a fine tradeoff they are winning all these battles for the fact we no longer have muschamp
@SAF4SAFF no shit.
How is Auburn only 9th in recruiting
@Morgan_Moriarty @BradenGall Ron Zook wishes Florida did
@ThomasGoldkamp lol yea. so much for florida making national headlines as @jeremycrabtree said. Making them for the wrong reasons
@slmandel losing recruits is a good tradeoff for not having muschamp here anymore
@Matt_HayesSN every single recruit UF loses I remind myself "this is a solid payoff for no longer having Muschamp run program into ground"
@JeffBarlis and it shouldnt be surprising at all. we should be happy we dont have muschamp in the first place. that alone is  &gt;top 10 class
@ZachAbolverdi its safe to say Mac is going to want 2 QBs next year. Minimum
@ZachAbolverdi which they really really needed. really only have 2 reliable QBs on the roster
@ABLichtenstein god i hope not. id take the 50th ranked class every year and a coach who knows what he is doing than top 5 and muschamp
@justinlyntz see: ron zook top 3 class every year
@justinlyntz Ill take the 50th ranked class with all 3 stars over Muschamp and what would have been a top 5 class
@RagjUF @joshnewberg247 so florida misses on a QB this class, which they really, 100% absolutely needed
@justinlyntz im just motivated to see what this staff does with a full year. 6 commits when they got here. now verge of top 25 class
@ThomasGoldkamp everytime we miss out on a big time recruit i remind myself "we no longer have muschamp, we no longer have muschamp."
@NFLFilmStudy I do not blame NFL coaches who stay as far away from college football for this very day for a reason
@NFLFilmStudy flying 17 year old kids out on private planes. Creating video packages and custom jerseys. WTF
@NFLFilmStudy my only issue is the attention whoring aspect. but i guess if i was a 17/18 yr old kid i would abuse being loved by everyone
if you tweet at high school kids over recruiting you could consider killing yourself. #recruiting
@CraigSagerJr who that is again? im a florida fan
@AlbertBreer @RapSheet except its not a day of players getting drafted by teams whose systems they dont belong in
@justinlyntz auburn has a ridiculous class
@CraigSagerJr not a shocker though, UGA hasnt had a relevant WR since AJ
@justinlyntz fuck if i know i dont see him on the schedule
@AlligatorArmy i pretty much figured we were done with him the moment muschamp was fired
@justinlyntz i knew it. he had a massive hardon for muschamp
@justinlyntz now cow art
@GatorCountry @NickdelaTorreGC oh hes one of those
I don't get it #worldstarhiphop 

If you can hold your gun sideways, why can't you hold your phone that way?


@UFWesTodd @AlligatorArmy Badly built team. What are you going to do.
@AlligatorArmy The sad part is he hasnt made a single progression. Not one, in a single facet of the game
@lateralus2801 @_dgr81_ gordon suspended a whole season. Can we revisit the Marshall to Cleveland thing now
Could someone direct me to a player Donovan missed more on than both Walker and Hill? Im not sure its humanly possible to be worse
#Vanderbilt has a truly awful place to play at when its not full. Sounds like im watching a high school game
it really wouldnt shock me if Florida lost to Kentucky by 30
I would like to apologize to @espn for wasting their time bringing GameDay to Gainesville for the UK smashing this weekend
@ThomasGoldkamp 243.83 for my optimistic outlook
@DK_Thompson thought it was 2017
@AlligatorArmy @BrandonCorder Alex Murphy was recruited to pass the ball
its pretty entertaining following twitter and seeing people shocked by how bad florida is at basketball this year. Are you new at this?
@AllKindsWeather teams been bad all year. im shocked when we win a game
@justinlyntz jk im not skinny im just a bot created by fazle
@lateralus2801 @_dgr81_ if you said roddy id say lets go
@_dgr81_ @lateralus2801 we'll trade you matt ryan for your defensive line
@_dgr81_ @lateralus2801 shouldnt carolina focus their efforts on filling their QB position
@lateralus2801 @_dgr81_ I wish jangles had twitter so i could forever troll him about his epic defense of JFF being the greatness
@_dgr81_ @lateralus2801 When Miles Austin is getting #2 snaps you're WR situation is a disgrace
@_dgr81_ @lateralus2801 Whether they keep him or not, they need a 2nd WR and its been reported today they are going hard after a solid WR
If you say "im speechless" youre not really speechless.
@_dgr81_ @lateralus2801 He sounds like a future Brown. Especailly since they probably will cut Gordon
@RyInCBus @CharlesRobinson can you take roddy white off our hands
@justinlyntz hacked again right
@justinlyntz dont know who beckner is :o
@justinlyntz 
@AllKindsWeather nevermind i see him. IGNORE ME
@AllKindsWeather You need to add Nick Buchanan to the list
@justinlyntz I only expect Ivey and McGriff. Hoping for Francois. Buchanan another OL on top i imagine. Anyone else ill be shocked
@justinlyntz Cowart has a hardon for Muschamp. I highly doubt he comes here. Will be shocked.
@justinlyntz This is all the guys apparently we are in the running for


@AllKindsWeather so we get like 2 of these dudes tops i imagine
@justinlyntz top 25*
@justinlyntz truthfully im shocked that we are in a spot to realistically finish in the top. We were ranked 100th or so a week ago
@justinlyntz now OL? Yea, we are taking anyone we can get. Thats because we have to. We literally needed 7-8 OL to fill the hole on OL
@justinlyntz and we dont have another DE outside of him. If Cowart is concerned about losing PT to a 2 star 220 pound DE I dont want him
@justinlyntz I imagine the no name no ranked DE we take is going to be a LB honestly. Dude is like 220. HE aint playing DE here
@justinlyntz Scarlett not yours lol fag
@SBNRecruiting links not working for me
@TheBullGator especially transitional classes which are mostly useless
@TheBullGator I've never tweeted at a recruit. But I have also given less fucks than years prior
I know the odds of this at 10:30 are slim but is anyone good with resumes? Because I need mine reviewed with the quickness
@ThomasGoldkamp @GatorBait247 ok. I see the team @ 63 on Rivals but i kept searching up and down 247 and saw nothing
@GatorBait247 @ThomasGoldkamp i must be blind. i dont see Florida on 247 Team rankings anywhere 
@JazzyJeff03 @DamoJarrett @IanKenyonNFL @DJMC25 I haven't seen a single patriots fan say "good job OL"

Not one. Its Brady or nothing.
@JazzyJeff03 @DamoJarrett @IanKenyonNFL @DJMC25 when you show me where  qb is only responsible for winning than show it to me
@JazzyJeff03 @DamoJarrett @IanKenyonNFL @DJMC25 which bb and new England is really good at.
@DamoJarrett @IanKenyonNFL @JazzyJeff03 @DJMC25 also I'm a lowly falcons fan I really have no dog in this fight I just strive for unbiased
@DamoJarrett @IanKenyonNFL @JazzyJeff03 @DJMC25 but its jot manninga fault his OL was wet paper. Not his fault harvin had a KO TD
@DamoJarrett @IanKenyonNFL @JazzyJeff03 @DJMC25 I'd take Brady over manning because I trust his mentality more. Honestly.
@DamoJarrett @IanKenyonNFL @JazzyJeff03 @DJMC25 if a qb puts up 400 yards at 6 ypa, that's not impressive
@DJMC25 @DamoJarrett @IanKenyonNFL @JazzyJeff03  context is hard. I know. It really is.
@DJMC25 @DamoJarrett @IanKenyonNFL @JazzyJeff03 Brady went 14-16 while averaging 3-4 air yards per pass. 

Keep up
@JazzyJeff03 @IanKenyonNFL @DamoJarrett @DJMC25 game plan has helped a ton but Christ Brady ran a 1 read system vs sea. Rookies run that
@JazzyJeff03 @IanKenyonNFL @DamoJarrett @DJMC25 statistically speaking its not a crazy idea. His advanced numbers are low comp to other hof
@DamoJarrett @IanKenyonNFL @JazzyJeff03 @DJMC25 you'll pass because it doesn't match with your opinion. 

Evidence 1 in ignorance
@DamoJarrett @JazzyJeff03 @IanKenyonNFL @DJMC25 why I would never
@DamoJarrett @JazzyJeff03 @IanKenyonNFL @DJMC25 I agree with this. Great game plan. So we should stop pinning all of this on brady
@JazzyJeff03 @DamoJarrett @IanKenyonNFL @DJMC25 no. New England won and Denver lost. I know this concept of team sports is new to you
@JazzyJeff03 @IanKenyonNFL @DamoJarrett @DJMC25 the highest ypa in sb history is 14.71.

Brady was at 6.6

Solid
@JazzyJeff03 @IanKenyonNFL @DamoJarrett @DJMC25 it must have been hard for Brady to complete 4 yard passes all game
@DamoJarrett @JazzyJeff03 @IanKenyonNFL @DJMC25 manning and Brady posted similar numbers vs Seattle in the sb
@erick_smith best selling Halloween costume of 2015
@JazzyJeff03 @IanKenyonNFL @DamoJarrett @DJMC25 do any of you pats fans know what 4+2 is? Just asking for a friend
@JazzyJeff03 @IanKenyonNFL @DamoJarrett @DJMC25 their team won a SB and they are still angry at someone's opinion. Truly a low IQ fanbase
@JazzyJeff03 @IanKenyonNFL @DamoJarrett @DJMC25 I'd say I'm shocked two patriots fans are angry over someone's opinion of Brady but I'm not
@AllKindsWeather @joosyjoost @IAKOWRylan @nwblackmon please tell me they are better writers than brody, that dude was Grade A++++++ terrible
@BeenHadRACKS Also the Dolphins played in Super Bowls VI, VII, VIII, XVII, XIX
@BeenHadRACKS You realize those are sharks, not dolphins? Right? No clearly you dont
@falcfans Denzel Perryman would be an instant upgrade over Worrilow. Fact of life Falcons fans cant seem to grasp
@falcfans People overrate our entire front 7. Most falcons fans think Bartu and Worrilow are solid LBers.
@bscaccio @RWeir7 @DougKyedNESN hindsight is a bitch. BB goes from making a horrible decision to looking like GOAT in one play
@bscaccio @RWeir7 @DougKyedNESN this is the intriguing thing to me. If SEA scores, BB not using his TO leaves NE with 15-20 sec to comeback
@RWeir7 @bscaccio @DougKyedNESN for someone who says he understands football he surely lacks ability to grasp context
@RWeir7 @bscaccio @DougKyedNESN im not doubting the pats job. Was solid, but christ lets stop propping brady up on Joes level
@RWeir7 @bscaccio @DougKyedNESN sea was up 10-0 after 2 possessions
@DougKyedNESN yes. the gameplan was fantastic. im not arguing this. im laughing at a lot of "brady=joe" garbage i see pop up today
@DougKyedNESN @RWeir7 @bscaccio look  in the 4th. Its not crazy to think 8-10 QBs can throw 15 balls 5 yards
@DougKyedNESN @RWeir7 @bscaccio and im arguing its not out of the realm of possibility that it could happen. NE ran a mostly one read
@DougKyedNESN @RWeir7 @bscaccio Because a WR catching a 3 yard ball and gaining 9 constantly will eventually give you a 8.3 YPA is my point
@DougKyedNESN @RWeir7 @bscaccio When I get a tape ill watch and track it. I dont trust YPA. I dont feel like air yards is part of this #
@RWeir7 @bscaccio @DougKyedNESN Because these teams dont have an elite head coach? DEN still kept going deep vs SEA last year. Not smart
@DougKyedNESN @RWeir7 @bscaccio i dont know if air yards is part of this, but if not, id be willing to bet air yards is more in line with 4
@RWeir7 @bscaccio @DougKyedNESN Yes, good, smart game planning. But that doesnt make Brady the elite of the elite for completing 3 yd passes
@RWeir7 @bscaccio @DougKyedNESN If Brady came out and took shots and was aggressive I would agree with you. He did neither in the 4th
@RWeir7 @bscaccio @DougKyedNESN there are 10 QBs who could have gone out and averaged 4-5 YPA which is what Brady did that 4th quarter
@bscaccio @RWeir7 @DougKyedNESN Ewww grammar. Has a more = Has a higher YPA/AYPA, by a lot.
@bscaccio @RWeir7 @DougKyedNESN Sample size is smaller but Wilson has a more AYPA/YPA in the playoffs than Brady in his career already
@bscaccio @RWeir7 @DougKyedNESN I just would like to see NE fans admit that they dink and dunked and Sea to death. Because thats reality
@bscaccio @RWeir7 @DougKyedNESN I wouldnt say 15. There are barely 15 QBs worthy of getting paid starting salaries in the NFL
@DougKyedNESN @bscaccio just out of curiosity (again, nit picking, not a NE hater). Highest YPA in SB Hist is 14.71, Brady was @ 6.6
@DougKyedNESN @bscaccio slight exaggeration. HE still has to play good vs a great D but he didnt take many chances
@DougKyedNESN @bscaccio youre not asking a lot of your QB to throw constant 3 yard bubble screens and slants
@CDCarter13 You need to reverse psych your readers now.
@CDCarter13 Then ppl retweet it. Put it on twitter and FBook. Then writer gets mad Player A jumped 4 rounds in value. Hmmm moron....
@CDCarter13 my fav part is by them talking about it this early they help raise a guys stock. Especially if you have A LOT of followers
@CDCarter13 ITS APRIL WHO CARES
@CDCarter13 i cant wait for 2 months to pass before half my twitter is idiots talking about the value of a round they drafted a guy in
@CDCarter13 a book about 2015 fantasy football mocks
@NEPD_Loyko What was his air yards per attempt? 3?
@pat_dooley I'd expect this comment from a horrible old white media member who asks awful questions for a living
@theebigbossSS 2nd round fantasy player now imo
@theebigbossSS sorry im slightly on my way to intoxication
@lateralus2801 livefeed it plz
@falcfans serious hater alert
Im just glad Katy didnt Owen Hart it
@lateralus2801 STILL KILLIN IT DOE
missy hasnt lost it.
@theebigbossSS bro how can you hate this
This halftime show is rather solid i say
oh shit missy
@MockingTheDraft werent they pretty bad all year? pass rush
@SCoxFB probably the latter
@SCoxFB This is like when I drove to a Chipotle yesterday at 9:30pm to see the line was nearly in the bathroom and turned around
@MattHarmon_BYB ...story instead of forcing it to us in one 40 minute episode.
@MattHarmon_BYB They could have accomplished the wedding storyline in 7...8 episodes and spent the rest of the season building the future
@MattHarmon_BYB that whole season was really really bad. a lot of wasted time
@onlygators Luckily we arent in dire need on D right now. Only area im worried about is LB and trying to get one more DL
@onlygators So what are we looking at realistically? Positional wise heading into signing day? 1 QB, Ivey @ OT and.....?
@onlygators So if Ivey commits thats 6 OL, think Mac goes after 7 if he can get it?
@EH_Gator13 but yeah i agree. badly constructed team. Walker was maybe his worst miss ever recruiting wise. Kid is just awful
@EH_Gator13 Hes done a lot of "let them figure it out" (which hes said in interviews). Not a fan of this for college kids
@EH_Gator13 and its easily the worst job Billy has ever done coaching in the 21st century. I predicted 10-12 losses after the 4th game lol
@EH_Gator13 really shocks me when this team scores more than 60 points. Doe Doe is the only legit offensive threat this year
@EH_Gator13 is pretty bad
Florida doesnt score for 6+ game minutes and is gifted a chance to win with bad officiating. Sounds right for how bad this team is
@APMarkLong this team is full of guys who shouldn't be playing in crunch time
@AverageGatorGuy is this a CBS game?
@DanielGillman @ESPNCBB ewwww
@IanKenyonNFL actually dont he probably doesnt know what the alphabet is
@IanKenyonNFL ask jameis winston
@ShakinSouthland i refuse to see it just because Franco is about as bad it gets. Im really not sure how this guy keeps getting "major" roles
@BruceWizayne wo
@agentlinton politics is funny. I actually find it entertaining that people think their voting will change the world
@SAF4SAFF brave of him to commit to a school with a coach on the hot seat
@JuMosq Atlanta fans are used to throwing money away on losers. One ship ever....yea
@GStubbsUFGators @ThomasGoldkamp yuuup. Exactly. Mac developed 1-2 star kids into all MWC and senior bowl players. I'll take that
@AlligatorArmy most=both. Baby in one hand tweeting ftl
@GStubbsUFGators @ThomasGoldkamp I'm not trying to dismiss it, Im trying to make people realize this class being bad isn't end of the world
@AlligatorArmy agree on most counts. Luckily I really don't see many areas a true freshman cab contribute outside OL and MAYBE LB/DE
@AlligatorArmy just looked at muschamp and meyers transition classes. 

Cringe
@AlligatorArmy random, am I wrong for laughing at the worry for this class? Transitional classes are generally disasters
@GStubbsUFGators @ThomasGoldkamp lastly its entirely too soon to judge Meyers transition class at OSU
@GStubbsUFGators @ThomasGoldkamp rather stupid to compare nick sabans recruiting to macs right now. A guy won big at LSU vs a young coach
@GStubbsUFGators @ThomasGoldkamp and l.murphy I guess but he was all over the place consistency wise until his last year
@GStubbsUFGators @ThomasGoldkamp 

4, MAYBE 5 players worth a shit out of a 15th ranked class. Only r.nelson legit
@GStubbsUFGators @ThomasGoldkamp and stamper was about as barely above average as you can get compared to his ranking
@GStubbsUFGators @ThomasGoldkamp if you're going to defend transition class try and list more than 3 players
@GStubbsUFGators @ThomasGoldkamp luckily for UF the only spot a true freshman would really play is @ OL. Its mostly quick depth filler now
@GStubbsUFGators @ThomasGoldkamp these coaches have all of 1 month, maybe 2 @ best, to find guys for their system and sell them
@GStubbsUFGators @ThomasGoldkamp again, who the fuck cares? You look @ most coaches transition classes they are chock full of transfers
@GStubbsUFGators @ThomasGoldkamp so you listed 3 players in a transitional class that ranked 15th that werent awful. you proved my point
@MyersNFL falcon punch reaction is the best
@JortsTorture no its not. But when you take multiple one stars and build them up to Senior Bowl NFL picks....doesnt matter the conference
@ThomasGoldkamp my hope is getting 3 more OL, 1 LB and a QB. Really all I care about to finish.
@ThomasGoldkamp exception to the rule
@ThomasGoldkamp I challenge ppl worrying over this to look at Meyer/Muschamp/Zooks transitional class and laugh at the uselessness of them
@ThomasGoldkamp the worry over this class is ridiculous to me. Transitional classes are full of transfers and non starters
@osgators if you give 5 mulligans i could equal that
