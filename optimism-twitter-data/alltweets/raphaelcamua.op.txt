THERE ARE RIOTS AT SEAFOOD CITY RIGHT NOW
People who will flaunt Mayweather's win when we get back to school on Monday, you're gonna regret it
You can see how this interviewer favors Mayweather
Fuck him. Fuck his ego. Fuck this fake ass interview.
Seeing Pacquiao smile even after all this bullshit just shows how he's the real winner here
I don't even wanna talk to the ppl here rn they all look so heated
Seeing Mayweather's son kiss/peace sign got me like 
How are some people calm about this fight
AY NAKO!
- everytime Pacquiao gets punched
@biticonjustine leave.
Mayweather be looking like that clingy side hoe, though 
When your parents see your grades so you try to get on their good side 
Why can't I have a love life like #MayPac

@notjennyoh OH PHEW
@notjennyoh yeah log TF off do ur essay
@notjennyoh no no :(
@lmfaojulia it's like what happened in Ferguson, there's a bunch of riots because of the injustice of the police or something like that
End rant.
@lmfaojulia best believe Imma have something to talk about
@lmfaojulia there's FEM club tomorrow at Lunch at H-something. Go to it Alex goes also I think
Feminism is not to downgrade and shit on men, it's to promote gender fucking equality why is that so hard to understand
One day when all of this is gone, we will wonder what caused it: it was us.
Fans will defend Jack and I get it, they wanna defend the guy they fan girl over, but don't sugarcoat this and say he's not misogynistic
At least there's good people in the world
Also, the fact that THESE CRIMES AGAINST DIFFERENT RACES ARE ALL CAUGHT ON CAMERA AND NOTHING IS BEING DONE really is fucked up.
@Stefdanielle_ thank you sm, you're very kind!
<RELIEVED FACE>
I also hate when people are like 'Wake up, America'. We are aware of these problems but never go beyond that.
Also I say this to close friends bc its never intended to be mean, but NEVER call ANY1 a slut for flaunting their body that they're proud of
And the fact that maybe times have changed, but issues (like feminism and racism) is still a big problem, is so hard to take in.
I get that the world is imperfect but what makes people have the attitude to make it stay that way
Love yourself. Self confidence is key. Don't let anyone try to bring you down for you loving yourself.
And I'm never bitchy to anyone nor am I pessimistic why the fuck do I still get karma that I don't deserve o my god
But real talk why do some ppl act like they hate me like I try my hardest at being happy/positive but they still try to bring me down wTF.
