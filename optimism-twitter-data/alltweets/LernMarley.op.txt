Thank the fucking lord, she's there. Fuck you Lauren. I hated you for a good hour or so

Ayyyy but jake and mani look good together. They're both very attractive
That picture is <FIRE>
WTFFFFFFF 
Oh ok. It's troy's bday. She gets a free pass
I'm sorry. This is unacceptable. A &amp; L should be there. It isn't her birthday but that's what they're celebrating...
Normani looks GORGEOUS
OMFG YASSS <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><FIRE>

This is hilarious...they all look annoyed  

I think I'd rather have the girls who don't take selfies with celebs than have a jake who takes them and they always look annoyed <EYES><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I fucking like what I see. Kendall, jaden, Dan...basically Justin's fucking crew <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> 
Ally has a LOT of white friends
What's this 
@LernMarley lol there's nothing abnormal about this. It's just surprising since they rarely happen and they seem to avoid it lol
What? 
Best performance of the night
YAS FUCK...OLD KANYE NEEDS TO MAKE A COMEBACK
GOLD DIGGERRRRRRR
I forgot how much I love Kanye's old stuff
Oh 
@LernMarley is he related to Kendrick?
Who's Brandon Lamar?
Nah. I don't believe it. 4/4 will be there. (I will roast any of the girls if they don't go)
Rumor has it that L won't be attending N's bday party....this better not be true
I loved that flannel he was wearing. That with his hair makes him look very '90s. I'm digging it
It's ok. He'll get better with time. After this summer tour of his, it'll be like he was never on break
Aw. I felt bad for him. It wasn't a great performance and he looked nervous af. It makes sense. He hasn't performed in a long time
Here for it 
Fuck outta here with that shit.
Does she want a fucking cookie? <COOKIE> It isn't a damn competition 
I hope it wasn't a casual encounter and they were actually hanging out
I think it's about time Lauren gets a couple of celebrity friends. Justin and Kendall would be perfect
That kendall and Lauren pic brings me back to when they talked at the tcas red carpet
OMG this better lead to a justin meeting. If not, Lolo will be on timeout. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> my heart <BROKEN HEART>
L, baby, don't do this to me. I'm ok with kendall and justin but that's it.
Only good thing I see happening is that she gets to meet/hang with Justin. That's it. Then she can drop the magcons
YES - NO 
YAS 
I've always wanted LM as a single but now I'm not so sure...cus lord knows we're always wrong about shit. Best example being 'worth it'.
@LernMarley so shut yo mouths and sit ya asses down
LOL @ ppl who think c gets the most hate..u haven't seen the hate L gets from the Latin side of the fandom. Or the hate d&amp;n get constantly

LMAO <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
h…
Wtf <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@LernMarley I'm talking about RTs
13k, 12k and 11k on each tweet respectively. Ppl love it when L tweets lol
Maybe it's cause I haven't really been to places that aren't tropical. I guess I just need to be introduced to it and who knows..maybe I am.
I'm not really a big nature gal. I do love the sky; I'm like in love with it. And I LOVE tropical places. But other than that...nope.
#5HWangoTango I'm ready <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@LaurenJauregui let's take a trip to Puerto Rico lol it's so magical there if u find the right places to go <BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>️<PALM TREE>
@LaurenJauregui have a great show(s) today! And most importantly, have fun! <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I'm so <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> with Lauren right now

Idk what makes me think that Lauren would be good at snapchat if she's never on here....
Lauren, can u make a snapchat? A public one? @LaurenJauregui
Loml 
@LaurenJauregui you're so beautiful. I fucking love you

Tbh, I'm not expecting any selfies with A-listers today...
Are there big posters like that for the other acts? Or just 5h?
This is crazy 
Lmaooo big rob "ok." <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Makes sense tho. They have the main show so they need time in between both sets. No way they were gonna put them last 
Has z100 seriously played WI four times already today?!?

Lets keep it up - STREAM w/ US IP!

I feel so left out when everyone starts to talk about moments in the fandom from the beginning LOL
@LernMarley omg I think I remembered him differently cus he's skinny af in this movie lmao
Channing Tatum in she's the man tho <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@TheRealJorgeM I love you. I was stuck watching drumline and u just saved me <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I'm tired
I wonder what it's like to be a camilizer...must be nice.
Anyway. I'm done with this topic.
@selenasoutIaw honestly idk. Why not use that to their advantage? They have 5 incredible vocalists. They should showcase that.
@LernMarley or 2/5 for that matter.
Honestly, I love fifth harmony. I love every single girl. That's exactly my point. I stan a group. So I don't wanna hear 1/5 80% of the time
She is now a professional singer. That is her profession. So why is it that I feel like that's the least thing she does
@selenasoutIaw yeah she is. Starts with "I won't believe a thing you say..."
The only way I get to really hear lolo's voice is through old X factor or personal videos <CRYING FACE> does that not make anyone else sad?
I wanna cry <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@LernMarley also, there should be more harmonies. I mean, that's their name right?
I see that the topic tonight is solo distribution once again. I've stated my opinion on this before. C gets too many, L&amp;D don't get enough
@selenasoutIaw I'd say We Know. And also the beginning of Everlasting Love is just her singing.
@selenasoutIaw I'm sorry if u took that the wrong way. In no way did I think u were hating! <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@selenasoutIaw no no! I'm not upset for your tweet. I'm upset about the fact that her talent isn't showcased enough.
My lrt. I agree 1000% I will deactivate soooo fast and not think twice about it if L is played again in 5h2. No way I'll stick around
@LernMarley <TIRED FACE> 
The world needs to see this. 
Most people do not fucking know how talented Lauren is!!! Only those who take the time to watch old videos do. Casual fans?...no. GP?...no.
This makes me so sad  
2/5 need to get laid <EYES>
Ayy! Jacob is on mtv hits. I really really love this song <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> 
He's cute
Ayyy 
That can't be clara...if it is, then I'm scared lmao <FLUSHED FACE>

Oh! Let me join... #WorthItIsGOLD
Why Alejandro why
Tf  
WI deserves an award show performance. Like, a real award show. (Bbma, vma, bet)
I liked the new choreo..now, they should work on the vocals in WI
<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW> they really need to work on their breathing 
The show today was practice for tomorrow and Sunday
Today's show is not exciting at all lmao I think everyone's waiting for tomorrow's wango tango
WI came on the radio and my lol turned it up lol I'm proud
Can they certify the others as platinum now?
Whatever. At the end of the day, the whole thing is kind of stupid.
I kind of don't like that yahoo article. They're very sarcastic throughout the whole thing. Kind of like they're making fun of them lol
Now I'm wondering...will the dancers go on tour with them??
Lauren always looks good. But theirs something about her today....wow. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
<PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
What's up with Dinah?
#NormaniIsWorthIt 
Like, "omg C wants to replace L in dc3" or the other way around...fuck off...both clique and dc3 are fucking amazing
Why can't ppl appreciate all the otps and ot3s in 5h? It's not a fucking competition between the girls. I always see a c vs l thing going on
Otp <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> 
I love Ally so much! She's gorgeous <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
<HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
My two new fav otps are Ally&amp;Will and Ally&amp;BigRob
Clique is so alive <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Those eyes give me chills every time  
Watching these vines makes me angry to think they don't take advantage of her fucking amazing tone 
Ugh <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
Will forever be my fav song, my fav acoustic performance of it &amp; my fav Lauren solo 
Ally is me 
THIS NEVER GETS OLD <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
My fav performance of theirs on X factor

Hot damn <FIRE><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
Wow..can I be in the middle? <FIRE> 

I need 5h to take a picture like this  

#21 (+4) NEW PEAK 
11 hour rehearsal tho. I would've been much more excited to hear that they've been rehearsing about 3-4 hrs a day for a few days...
This is the correct way of hyping up a mv <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>. 5h need to take notes. 

@Zendaya 
#BadBloodMusicVideo 
@Nicole5H Yeah they have a show today. I hope they do rehearse. Probably depends on what time they perform
I guess I need to learn that this will happen every once in a while lol. We need to blow off some steam and then we're right back on track
It seems funny to me today how we've been acting the last couple of days omg...we were in such panic, and rage and yet here we are... <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Basically <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW> 
I love this. There's Lauren bossing Dinah around on one side and then u have Camila..doing god knows what <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

Aw ally <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

Calm down Camila...it's a piece of paper <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
Dinah was so offended <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> and meanwhile, Camila...lmao 
This is sooo cute <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> lol 
This isn't talked about enough <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
That pop radio update tho <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> let's keep that up pls
LOL this was hilarious 
Yay 
Kay. I'll leave y'all with my little tiger <TIGER FACE> goodnight <CRESCENT MOON> 
Oh! Maybe she's talking about the amount of RTs she's getting? Maybe lol cus then yes. Your rt game is strong af 
Practice makes perfect.
Anyway. I'm excited to see what they have planned for wango tango <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@LernMarley *shouldn't
Idk. Maybe it's just me but I think they should tire themselves out, especially if they have a busy weekend coming up.
For example, today. They (esp. Mila) looked tired as hell in those snaps. And Sean tweeted about a long day of rehearsals.
They jam everything together in such little time. If they had a couple of days of rehearsals, they wouldn't need to rehearse all day long
The reason why I get upset that they get such little time to rehearse is cus they exhaust themselves trying to make up for the time lost
@LernMarley <WHITE UP POINTING BACKHAND INDEX>they should've been rehearsing all week, not just today. But I'll cut them some slack since they brought back the dancers lol
LOL 
I hate that Dinah always deletes her shady tweets now <PENSIVE FACE>
And no. I am not impressed or pleased that they're rehearsing. They have a show tomorrow so it's like them to rehearse a day before
And I'm not even gonna ask where Lauren is cus I've just learned to accept that she LOVES to disappear on us..I'm <SLEEPING FACE> with that one
So they're rehearsing right? Why is that one dancer with them? <EYES>
<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
I need those 3 reds to fall already so WI can get back to being #11 
OMG that Austin doing the little flip kick thing vine lmaoooo <SKULL><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I really really don't get what ppl see in ansel
But guys..Ally is soooo beautiful <HEART WITH ARROW>

I love Dinah best when she shades <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
I'm still mad tho...they're all online and have yet to fucking acknowledge THEIR SINGLE
I need one of them to at least tweet about WI being #21
@LaurenJauregui wait I just checked..you've rted twice recently...

I am so fucking mad! Damon and Elena were supposed to be human together and get married and have children <TIRED FACE>
<LOUDLY CRYING FACE><TIRED FACE> this isn't right. TVD should end. It cannot continue without Elena wtf. Delena were supposed to be endgame <BROKEN HEART>
OMFG KMFG omfg Elena dies next week <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> noooooo
Why is it that whenever I'm upset with the girls, they post super cute pictures and videos and I'm sucked right back in
They make it very difficult to stay mad at them. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
That's all I have to say. I'm on a mini strike rn LOL they have yet to do anything to promote themselves so until then, bye <VICTORY HAND>️
And Norminah <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> now they are tooo precious...I love them
Ally and big rob are super cute..and it's nice to see she's on snapchat again

Lauren is sooo fucking worth it. She's fucking perfect. I fucking love her. Fuck.  <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ #LaurenIsWorthIt
I'm upset with them. All of them. But #LaurenIsWorthIt *sigh*
Dammit. I really don't like the idea of trending something but I'm pretty much fed up so.... #5HAreYallGonnaDoSomethingOrNah
I don't think I'd still be here had I only found #that side of the fandom
I will never regret getting into this side of the fandom (business side). I've learned so much. I'm so happy I didn't end up on the bhb side
@themikeinator btw. I don't want a 'thank u guys, I love u' tweet. I want to see them doing productive promoting on here. <SKULL>
Even jb tweets about rehearsals and studio time. Who tf do 5h think they are!? The president? Damn. Always so secretive about shit.
Please no tags or trends...let's not stoop down to the blenders' level <SKULL>
Lol. I had to get that out. And I tried very hard to be nice about it <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@themikeinator it's a huge accomplishment to get to where they are,and although I know they care,it doesn't seem like it. They don't show it
@themikeinator we've gotten them to #21, but without their help...we won't be able to get them higher. We've done pretty much all we can
@themikeinator do follow sprees or tweet the link, something. I want to know that they want it just as much as I want them to be successful
@themikeinator I've given up on epic and their crappy management team, but the girls have ways of promoting themselves on here. They should
@themikeinator we get tired. Sometimes, it's nice to know that they care and they see. I know they do but we need to see it and hear it
No thanks. Not if they aren't willing to help

Ok. I hate Lauren for not posting about WI. But at the same time, she's posting about Tori and Maia so
@LaurenJauregui worth it is #21 on bb hot 100. I know u know this. Post about it. Tweet the link. Rt about it. Something.

The see you again video get me every fucking time. Dammit. I'm here fighting back the tears lol
Go on and vote for fifth harmony  
@Q100Atlanta @adambombshow hey! It'd be awesome if you played Worth It by @FifthHarmony ft Kid Ink #AdamBombs5at9
Very few are lucky enough to blow up without much struggle. (They're usually decent looking boys with mediocre vocal abilities <EYES>)
In this industry, those who make it are the ones who want it the most but also work for it just as much.
They better not be getting ready for the next single when we've come so far with WI. Not yet.
I just really hope that they haven't given up on WI. It kind of seems like it. They have no promo planned for it that we know of.
@camilacabello97 @LaurenJauregui @dinahjane97 @NormaniKordei @AllyBrooke @Epic_Records @wearefaculty @FifthHarmony get to promoting

@camilacabello97 hi! Thought you'd like to know that worth it is #21 on billboard's hot 100
@AllyBrooke you might wanna know that worth it is #21 on billboard's hot 100!
My theory: someone from 5hontour hacked the group account. <RELIEVED FACE>
Watch the video 
Buy it on @iTunesMusic 
@FifthHarmony @Spotify @iTunesMusic who are you?
She's cool...and very beautiful
Currently watching hailee on ellen
I have faith <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

@LernMarley I'm not sure they're known enough in the uk to tour there <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
#AllyIsWorthIt because anyone who has ever met her says so
If that's true then I must admit, I'm surprised...I've wanted them to tour the UK but so soon? Idk...idk
Hmm 
In that video, I dead ass thought Camila was gonna jump in the pool <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> she should've! #5HUKinvasion
Honestly, I think D just wants to be single for a while. And she should be.
#5HUKinvasion <REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER G + REG>

@FifthHarmony it shouldn't always be a secret what ur up to! We'd especially like to see when they're rehearsing <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
If the group account has finally decided to listen then post graphic content of what the girls are doing (pics, videos, ect.) @FifthHarmony
No but seriously. Who runs that shit now?
I need to know who is running the group account now so I can personally thank them <SMIRKING FACE> lol jk

<HOT BEVERAGE>️ 
I'll deactivate if it's BHB
Ok do if it's true that TIHWR is the next single then I'm happy! But idk, I feel like they should give WI a chance to be a top 20 hit
Wth? 
What's this talk about another single?
Hey! What's going on?
<VICTORY HAND>️
#Buy5HWorthItOniTunes 
I'm done with complaining about their lack of promo. I give up. It is what it is.
The whole harry/LM thing was funny at first but now it's just ugly. They're slut shaming them and that's not cool. It's def gone too far
I hate their management..so fucking close to top 10 and they don't do shit about it
And tomorrow it will def lose a couple of spots <UNAMUSED FACE>
Fucking light red dammit
@LaurenJauregui @NormaniKordei @AllyBrooke @dinahjane97 @camilacabello97 since ur management won't get u real promo use what u have(twitter)
@LaurenJauregui @NormaniKordei @AllyBrooke @dinahjane97 @camilacabello97 may I suggest maybe at least posting the link on twitter
@LaurenJauregui @NormaniKordei @AllyBrooke @dinahjane97 @camilacabello97 do u guys even see how well WI is doing? How about acknowledging it
Fuck outta here Meghan
No news on camren, so they're probably still in Miami omfg I'm so mad
I hate them
So...they're in la? Omg idk why I still have hope that they're not going home
Ok. This # is taking it a little too far #/NORESPECTFORLITTLEMIX
Idc where they are as long as they're not going home
Wait...maybe nyc lol
I think they're in LA
Dammit. 13
So they went home then?
Oh! Aw 

I've recently found a new reason to hate Mondays...the voice.

#BuyWorthItOnITunes
I haven't even seen the video where they left swipe harry <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I doubt it's worth my time. I'd rather watch Lauren's hair tutorial..once again.
It's not a big deal, and I'd be defending the girls had it been them...but since it's not, I'm just sitting back laughing at these tweets
Oh damn 
One of my favs 
@LernMarley this tweet is so ugly <CONFOUNDED FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Those girls just put their foots in their mouths time and time again, don't they
Lol @ all the directioners coming for lm <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Whenever I see Charlie post about his artists, it makes me want to punch the shit out of LA
Q102 played it 2 times

Beanie Lauren <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
@LernMarley

That smile <TIRED FACE> 
Wrong gif <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Sexy dork <FIRE><WHITE SMILING FACE>️ 
I'm in love with this gif <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> 
Warning: I'm most likely going to be spamming with Lauren gifs and pics lol u can thank awesomenesstv
@LernMarley 
<PANDA FACE> 
But at the same time, she has this really goofy side...idk man, Lauren is super endearing in all aspects
@5hRealm thanks!!
I forgot to mention that it's sort of a dry/sarcastic sense of humor..like she'll say something funny/sarcastic with a really serious face
Lauren has a Kristen Stewart-y type of sarcastic humor. You can especially see it towards the end of her hair tutorial takeover
@5hRealm q102?
KIIS played WI 2 times days (none yesterday)
@LernMarley do they watch each other's solo takeovers is basically what I'm wondering
I'm very curious to know of the girls watch the takeovers...like yeah maybe the ones where they're all in, but I mean like the solo ones
BB prediction? I'll say 26 or 27
@Nicole5H yeah
Save yourselves and watch this <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
Go watch.

I feel like cleaning everyone's TL...I'm bored with the current topics
I'm not trying to hint at anything in my last tweet btw
I wonder what L &amp; C decided to do besides watch the fight since one doesn't like violence and the other was looking for an open Starbucks
Oh shit. The voice <UNAMUSED FACE> 
Forget justin..who's that sexy ass chocolate man behind him <EYES> 
I find Lauren's hair "tutorial" more interesting than that fight
Tom Brady is <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> I love him and the patriots <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> that's my team <FLEXED BICEPS>
AHHH! My husband was there!!! I didn't know omg <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
So mayweather won....moving on lol look at this babe <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
Highlight of the night: Bieber's hair.
I went wild during that fight lol cotto is boricua <FLEXED BICEPS>
This fight is boring...I enjoyed the cotto mayweather fight soooooo much more
So wait...Camila nor Lauren are watching the fight?
Camila's cute
I don't like how mayweather fight LOL he makes me wanna punch him..so fucking cocky
Candece <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

But.. 
Why does seeing her tattoo make me feel some type of way <EYES><TIRED FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><BEATING HEART> 
@LaurenJauregui don't ever cut ur hair! It's soooo beautiful so there's also no need to be insecure about it babe <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Holy shit mani! <FIRE> 
Omg I love her <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>

She's so <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@LernMarley oh! Lol she says it here that she doesn't do her hair LOL I hadn't seen this 
Anyway, it's Lauren. I'm probably gonna watch the takeover a couple 500 thousand times lol
So it's Lauren's hair tutorial tonight? But...I thought she didn't really do anything to her hair for shows??
This arguing going on with LM stans is pointless lol they're delusional, so just let them be delusional, bendito <PENSIVE FACE>
@gabeharmonizer that's why we need tv promo...it's the only way imo that it'll get up there
What's going on? Is there like a package deal with WI and DFH we didn't know of? Cus damn, it's always RIGHT THERE with us
I don't like ppl that diss body rock

All these pictures from that day are <FIRE> I need to see the ones from the actual shoot
OMG <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

Quieren burlarse del acento de L? Escucha cómo hablaba William Levy antes de appended a controlar su pronunciación 
Ayyy they just showed the girls on telemundo
I hate that guy for getting in the way lol but <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> ot5<PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> 
I hope everyone is streaming
Guysssss I have a feeling we won't like tomorrow's radio update <TIRED FACE> god I hope I'm wrong
They all should though tbfh
I think AT LEAST one of the girls will tweet about WI when it hits top 10 on iTunes..
KIIS hasn't played WI today? <PILE OF POO>
I've come to the realization that my tweets are always all over the place lmao every tweet is a new topic
I want Tinashe to take Lauren out partying or something <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
What 1D need to do.. 
@LernMarley she should post something about WI <EYES>
Camila has 1.9 million followers on IG....damn <FLUSHED FACE>
I fucking hate that they mention her using her full name....god forbid she decides to check indirects rn..imagine if mike did <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR><FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SWEAT>
Oh god...I cringe whenever I see the 'yet again' from BB <CONFOUNDED FACE>
Latinos (keyword: LATINOS) are making fun of L's spanish accent.... <THUMBS UP SIGN>
I'm blocking anyone that I see making fun of L's accent...I don't need of ur ignorant asses on here
She's CUBAN. That is her CUBAN ACCENT fucktards... 
The spanish side of the fandom can all fuck off. Tu me entiende? <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
My beautiful Snow White <SNOWFLAKE>️<KISS MARK> 
I have yet to see that Barbie episode lol I'll do it later
I deleted that...it's stupid and she's just overreacting lol
@LernMarley *btw <UNAMUSED FACE>
Bye. That Ally interview was cute lol her talking about being 21 and drinking but not doing it very often <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY> I love her
It still shocks me whenever I watch this how similar she looks to that vine of her crying about ellen <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR> 
First LM stans talk about how they need a 5hontour...now mahomies lol
@LernMarley *for not 'at'
Not @ ppl coming at L for speaking spanish the way she does
Yes. 
Oh! And Camila says 'um' a lot like I do lol I guess that part just never goes away because I say 'um' without noticing that I say it <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
But u get better at it and get used to it the more u speak it..and now I make fun of myself for not knowing how to say something lol
Lauren speaking spanish reminds me so much of me growing up. I was so shy and never spoke it that often in fear of saying something wrong
But did y'all peep Norminah goofing off in the back during that interview? Lol
wardrobe | @galialahav 
shoes | greymerofficial 
jewelry | @isharya… 
But why didn't I ever hear about her crying at the airport? Is this the first time everyone's hearing about it?
Idk if it was because they were speaking spanish, but I love the fact that they seemed a bit more open with their answers. Do it more often!
YAS  
Wait...tinashe liked Lauren's pic?
That interview made me sad lol it's bringing up all the bad memories that came with their breakups...it sucks to know they hurt
Why does she do this to me!? <TIRED FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
@LernMarley speaking spanish wow <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> I knew she was fluent but damn she's as eloquent in spanish as she is in English <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Their accents are so different. Lauren is so Cuban lol and it's cute to watch her stumble a bit with a few words. And Camila is just amazing
But on another note...I just fell more in love with Lauren and Camila. When they speak spanish, I melt lol <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
n c saying how she cried at an airport after her breakup and was upset with herself for letting it show...my girls <CRYING FACE> I just want to hug them
That interview really got to me..idk why lol but Lauren talking about how something hurts and to see it everywhere hurts more
Wow. Just wow 
@LernMarley not all obviously but u know..most are(not saying it's a bad thing tho)
C girls are so sensitive lol
Not over this picture tho 
Regarding the tickets sales, everyone should chill. They'll be fine by the time the tour actually starts
There's no better feeling than seeing the words 'dark green' on your timeline <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
Ngl I'm still laughing at that vine <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
That vine is hilarious <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@gabeharmonizer @CAMILASJERGI <TIRED FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Oh hey <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><HEART WITH ARROW> 
Lmao y'all probably zoom in on every picture of L just to get somewhat of a nip slip
styling by:… 
That was us...watching and waiting for a 30 second presentation from the girls <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
And tbh, they have to do it now that WI is hot...they can't let the momentum slow down
I really hope the girls have promo lined up for this week before may 8th. Cause that's when they'll start getting busy and have no time
But wow guys. Camila looks amazing
Wow <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

I understand that WI will fall on iTunes a bit. There's been no big promo and that's just how iTunes works...the #s are constantly changing
How do u not have access to your group's account? And I don't think it's just Lauren...it's all of them most likely

@FifthHarmony you can't just leave us with a vague ass tweet!We want to see what you're up to. Post pics of y'all getting ready or something
And they LOVE to lip sync ugh I hate it
The thing about Latin award shows is that they get boring fast lol I don't think I've ever watched a whole show before
Guys...I really really don't think they're performing..I don't want ppl to be disappointed
@cuteafjauregui these Latin awards are more performances than they are actual award shows
Is it still possible for that "trip" to Mexico with Juan Gabriel be true?
It'd be amazing to see Normani and Dinah throughout the night lol they're gonna be so lost with all those ppl speaking spanish <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@FifthHarmony @LatinBillboards @soyjuangabriel you need to be a bit more specific lol ppl are getting their hopes up for a performance <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I think they're presenting him an award
They're probably presenting him, presenting him an award or presenting with him...but I don't think they're performing
I don't think they're performing....
With juan Gabriel? Are they presenting him or something?
Wait....what?
They always have them boards on the red carpet that show what's trending on twitter. How about we make sure 5h is on there all night?
It'd be funny to fill the Latin BB's tag with all things 5h tonight lol make sure they know who they are
@dinahjane97 remember how u said that u tried to periscope at the KCAs? Well, try again tonight at the Latin BBs. Lol (SC is better tho)
Can dinah just record throughout the whole night? Lol 
He def has the body for it..I'm tired of seeing him play 'college jock' roles. He deserves better than that
Zac efron should play some time of super hero in a movie or something
@5HonTour @JLo @FifthHarmony #5HenLosPremiosBillboard
#5HenLosPremiosBillboard
I hope they fucking slay that red carpet!!! They need to look on point today <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
Can we get pics of the girls getting ready? Cus I KNOW they must be doing that right about now
What does that mean? 
People are starting to go overboard with this drama. It's getting annoying and I just want c to stop being mentioned in everything they do
Original. Very original kid. Stop this shit man. It's getting tiring......
I love hearing Lauren and Camila speak spanish. Their spanish is so different lol L is Cuban af while C is kind of a mix
Is WI possibly maybe coming back to life on rhythmic?
Saw this yesterday but it deserves another post lol <HEART WITH ARROW> I luh her

I'm not expecting the girls to be on that summertime ball list today..I just don't think it's happening
I don't want them anywhere near my girls
And speaking of the cramps, they have a show in Cali at the same time the girls do this summer <SKULL>
I see ppl bringing up Brauren <TIRED FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> stopppp i shipped them hard..I hate him for letting L down <PENSIVE FACE>

@LernMarley Perrie teas
Why does it look like she has her hairline colored in <EYES> 
Demi lmao
I ship camren. But I call it Laurmila now cause I feel like the name 'camren' is tainted by crazies
If WI keeps it up, it has the chance to get very close to the top 10 <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
I'm so excited for the Latin bb awards, u have no idea! I'm ready for 5h to slay Latin America and this is the beginning of it all <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
Lauren is so cute at the end lol 
Not gifting or receiving...just helping the tag trend <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> #GiftMeWorthIt
Look at how cute <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<HEART WITH ARROW> 
L and A should say a few words lol...but if they think it's best c talks then I get it..she's the most fluent. Little spicy Latina <DANCER>
That's weird tho...Camila was the only one rehearsing what they're gonna say tomorrow..hmm
HOLD UP...I'm just seeing this now! 
Y'all are so good at Photoshop, it's scary. But I must say, I wish these were real 
Lol 
Wait...16? YAS <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
Did they give the group account to someone else? Cus I'm liking it.
And then the icing on the cake <UNAMUSED FACE> fuck you 
<SKULL> dammit. Did they really need to bring that up? 
It's great to know the song is rising without us doing a gifting spree <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> and without a discount <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> and no promo <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
*waiting for the the voice song to plummet on itunes*
And of coarse she'd be cool with it. She's such a sweetheart
I'm really not posting pics of Dinah cus I don't agree with ppl asking her for selfies...I mean, unless she's cool with it idk
Ally looks so beautiful today 
Maybe it's just here in PR...but Catholics get really upset when they use the term 'Ostia' lol
Ostia....LOL Camila
@camilacabello97  I don't think u should say that lmao isn't that bad?
@camilacabello97 @AlejandroSanz @LatinBillboards lmaooo
Lol that was very sudden. How did WI move up to #17?

She's so precious 
Sunshine! <YELLOW HEART><BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>️

She's just so fucking GOOD! Omg I stan her so hard <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> @torikelly 
Lol @ that summertime ball profile. I think they're just messing with everyone's heads to get RTs. It's so unlikely that 5h are performing
I wonder if we'll get any hints as to where WI ranked on the bb hot 100 this week. I think last week(or before), we knew by Wednesday so...

I know everyone hated them two together lol, I being one cus u know..fuckboy BUT she seemed so into him
I know I shouldn't be, but I'm soooo curious as to what went wrong between c and a...
Lrt. Whenever I watch that video, I can't help think about that one person who said L was just scratching her coochie the entire time <SKULL>
Ok. This is an article I like to see. Not one about a group member possibly leaving the group.  
I think I might join this Harmonizer tori kelly fan club I see happening LOL I just love her. So talented

She's totally wearing her bomber jacket PLUS her hair is straight <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
@LernMarley first of all...where is she going? And second, he's cute af lol
Well, I'll be damned 
@xoxoLaurmani lmao I thought nothing of it until I saw this tweet. Goes to show how so used to seeing weird stuff i am..weird ass fandom
I just saw t swizzles ig post with the sheep. She and Camila are sooo alike LOL I get why they're friends..silly girls
Where in the world will they find the time to make a mv and then promote it....(plus the possibility of the promo tour in the uk for WI)
I feel like, with a summer single, I'd worry about the promo. They already have A LOT of stuff booked for the summer including the tour
Other than those two songs, I won't accept any other single from them. Just, NO. And I'd unstan if it's BHB. (Probably not but <SKULL>)
that can also be great for summer days. But the problem is the risk. Sometimes the outcome can be unpleasant and that makes me nervous.
track and it samples Mariah, who btw is their label mate so they have easy access to have her in the mv if they want. It's a feel-good song
LM is different. It'd be a HUGE risk, which I sometimes think is what 5H needs. Its a great song. The vocals slay, every girl sings on the +
Plus it's an upbeat song,great for summer. This style of music is what is killing it in the market right now. BUT it also sounds too generic
I've said this a million times lol but my two picks for singles are TIHWR and LM. TIHWR cause it'll be amazing live. Imagine the choreo. +
Anyways..I see that there's a possible summer single. The girls said they were focused on WI and would decide in the summer which one's next
The girls def didn't like the schedule they had during the tour.I agree 100% They overworked them.I mean 5-6 shows in a row multiple times <FLUSHED FACE>
@LernMarley fighting with her LMAO Normani was a wild child <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Normani always has a crazy story about her childhood lmao first that she bit a girl for a puzzle piece and now that her BFF broke a mirror

That pout tho <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> 
Dinah was also dead on with ally's dance lol
I bet Lauren practices that move in the mirror and Normani has caught her doing it <SMIRKING FACE> LOL
Camila was dead on with Lauren's hair and eye thing lmao
LAURMANI FTW
Lauren was so excited to imitate Normani <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️

Are we still holding out hope for a uk promo trip this summer? Cause I mean, we're hoping for the one thing they suck the most at...promo.
And btw <WHITE UP POINTING INDEX>️ more than half of these artists they promote DONT promote them back
These girls need to learn how to promote themselves and not every other artist that is selling more than they are atm
Caminah just had the chance to promo their tour or ANYTHING else besides worth it on kiissfm and they joked about opening a restaurant <TIRED FACE>
Lol Caminah is funny
Real? 
4/5 of the girls have either mentioned Natalie or played 'somebody' today. L is the only one who hasn't
@LernMarley like I said...this Natalie promo <EYES>
@LernMarley oh damn such low quality....whatever
Slay <FIRE> 
Fun fact: I fell in love with 'Style' when she performed it at the VS fashion show. Her and Karlie look really good together
Me 
I really love style by TS. She did it so wrong with the music video...
I want to see Camila let loose, be sexy and just explore her sexuality. I do love her dorky side but sexy Camila would be <FIRE><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@SimonCowell are you planning on meeting up with the girls soon?
My pop princesses <CROWN><CROWN><CROWN><CROWN><CROWN> 
I love hailee <HEART WITH ARROW>
Some people like to insult the girls and say it's "constructive criticism". Wtf go away
Can we talk about how 5/5 slayed the choreo in their performance??? <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
Laurmila had this motto in mind tonight when they didn't know which way to go after their speech lol 
@LernMarley I feel I should explain "overboard". I mean that she said the same thing on two occasions...not that she was talking too much
@snapbackdmac yeah same. But I trust them. I don't think I've ever been disappointed with a live performance of theirs
@snapbackdmac watch it. It's great! They look beautiful and slayed it <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
@snapbackdmac the rdma's performance
I love the girls and they freaking murdered that stage and the whole freaking show. Not to be biased but it was def 5H's night <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<WHITE SMILING FACE>️<COLLISION SYMBOL>
Ok that's it. I'm honestly just being nitpicky(is this a word?) at this point cus the GP most likely didn't catch those things so yeah...
Lastly, I just don't like it when the track overpowers their vocals. But this one I'll let slide considering there was a lot of dancing.
Third, C's crowd hyping. I don't really mind it, but I think she went just a tiny bit overboard this time. She gets excited, I get it lol
Second. C's note change when she says "bluff". Idk it was just weird. Actually that whole lyric change part sounded weird.
Ok. First. A moved slightly to the side before they started singing <TIRED FACE> whyyyy!? The spacing would've been absolutely PERFECT had she not.
@LernMarley but before I do, I will say that I LOVED the performance. It was freaking amazing! <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
@snapbackdmac hell yeah lol it's a tricky market
I just saw the perf. again. I don't want to be the one to point out the things I didn't like but it's bothering me so I have to let it out..
@snapbackdmac idk. I think it'd be a great single in the uk lol but idk about the US
Tbh the more I listen to this, the less it sounds like he's saying "long neck".... 
That jacket ugh I love it on her <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><TIRED FACE> 
This is cute. I really like Olivia. I kind of had an obsession with pageants the year she won lol 
Go ahead bo$$...get that platinum certification if u haven't already <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
Ok so about the performance...I LOVED it! The first 30 seconds tho <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><FIRE> they looked so fierce ((very few minor details that were meh to me))
I wonder if there'll be another single off of reflection before 5h2....I hope so (still rooting for TIHWR or LM)
6, 4, 1, 3, 5 and idgaf about his popularity
