People in this world are OD shallow... And society convinces and encourages that mindset. Can't blame yall.
People who don't have it.. Hate on those that do.. And what they do with what they have. Envy will misguide your words.

Gotta new chick that I can only thank God for....
People want more than what they work for and that shit is backwards to me.
The real is back. 
And then you, came to save the day and I must say I think you may have done some more.
@OffTheeWall model lifeeeeeeeeeee
Look nobody's excusing your dirty mirror. Youre just filthy
So I gotta boot on my car last night
Can't have convo with mentally 1 dimensional people. They can never see the big picture or the details within it.
@OffTheeWall appreciate it dawwwggg. Much <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
If you're not gonna do something right, don't do it. You're wasting my life. And I do value it.
I can't even be friends with people not trying to grow mentally. I know someone can relate. It's like running around with weights attached.
No bribery, no behind closed doors, there's still people out there virtuously working towards their goals. No strings attached.
Peoples minds have been clogged up with such BS that can't even recognize the real.
@JColeNC finally someone who gets it
Phil 4:13. It gets hard sometimes but we just keep on going
I can never talk to much about stuff that I'm not doing.. That ish just don't work for me. &amp; it disgusts me when other people do it.
I got a hunch a lot is gonna go down in 2015.
Cole is the realist. There really is just now other way to put it.
The holidays don't even feel the same anymore when you're not at home. I can't even tell Xmas is around the corner.
@footlocker @russwest44 @Jumpman23 dope commercial!

J. Pole album getting hella back lash
John Wall the truth man.

Drake can't have no more 6 God flows. He back to wheel chair Jimmy now.
Never being satisfied can either cause you to be rich or broke.

God Damn.
New James Bond movie on the horizon!
A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.
I have not always been right, but I have always been sincere."
I thought for sure that Harden would get a signature shoe before Irving
Cole is getting my money December 9th. I support bro. Bottom line. He's one of the realist doing it. Not just bout the money. @JColeNC

The longer you eat for free the harder it is to feed yourself when the free food stops coming
Niggas iPhones always cracked
I forgot what it feels like to call you and you actually care about what I'm saying.
I get nothing that I want from anybody but everybody wants the same me. Not no more.
In theory... This against Black Friday thing could really have an impact
I've been hearing everything that I want too from everyone but you..
Yea. I'm going to sleep.
Hoes making money off of things that used to be priceless.
People act like there aren't lawn mowers on both sides of the fence. Watch me now.

People want to rush to wear a crown but don't have the patience to build their Kingdom.
I swear I be wanting my phone to blow up more and then when it does I never respond lol
Tip of the day for the most of yall..... Talk less and read more..... Stress less and pray more. Wisdom is more valuable than gold.
Don't let your favorite celebrity fool you. They tweeting sitting on their ass just like the rest of us.
Best gift you could ever give some one is consistent effort... You give me consistent effort... You can keep your money.
The little things matter so much more. My favorite gifts don't always come from a store
My state of my mind is that no one else's matters.
Boo thang fell asleep.
Bout to eat then come back to this UCLA vs USC game. Not much of a game though.
Always start my weekends with a couple early morning hoop sessions!

@ShawtyTOOShort if you're saying that an adult can't date a child, that the maturity has to be reciprocated. You're the G.o.a.t
@EbonyReina how you know?
Cole bout as real as they come. That's the type of stuff I wanna do. Pray this album break records.
TI album was trash! Like there was one song worth playing twice and that was King

You either making progress in life or you going backwards
I appreciate what I have now.. I'm not gonna lose it to learn it.
When you know your worth you go and get it
Difference between you &amp; I is every thing I say is validated by production. You talk before it happens, I'm telling you how I did it.
Dreams.
@Monifaa_xo @TheStartrPack all of my aunties but one fit this description lol
@Trippy_Nigga1 you think so fam? I'm trying to find a pair I like.
Uggs or timbs for a male?

At this age if you aren't constantly trying to improve yourself you're wasting time.
Being Mary Jane is on.. Gabrielle Union. I'm intrigued
I can never sleep after work..
People stay making excuses..
Guarantee the Heat will have a better record than the cavaliers.
Stuck on mine, keeps me focused
@OffTheeWall <BABY><BLACK RIGHTWARDS ARROW>Ô∏è<GIRL><BLACK RIGHTWARDS ARROW>Ô∏è<WOMAN>. Let it marinate. Don't forget who your real real friends are.
@OffTheeWall you ain't even check me you just hung up... Soooooo. You tripping tonight bird
Continuosly falling back is how shit falls apart. If you want better, ask or demand. Either way if it's fair we want compliance.
Mark Sanchez kind of did his thing tonight. Another Alex Smith?
@OffTheeWall my comment will stand the tests of time.
@OffTheeWall when quality is that foreign to peasants.
And when deciding to stay with the boy remember alllllll the chances your mother had to give your brother.
My only advice to women is to know the difference between a man who makes a few mistakes and a boy that has too many more to make.
Dudes will have their "brothers" all over they social media but never their girl though.. #SUSPECT
Sticking your extension cord in a new outlet won't supply you more power. You lost all of what you thought you had en route.
‚Ä¢ Brian Hoyer: 9-3
‚Ä¢ Everyone else: 1-12 
Teyana Taylor's album was a solid effort but it wasn't the greatest.
Kyrie is gonna have gonna have to stop wanting to be the leader.
Continue to learn your God. Learn your craft. Learn your relationships. Learn life.
Hoping to have a descent holiday season.
Andy Dalton was trash tonight.

Hoyer: 198 yds
West/Crowell/Tate: 1 rush TD each
Browns DEF: 4 takeaways 
Cleveland gets its 1st division road win since 2008. 
Miami Heat are on point so far too. Show Lebron what he missed out on.
Cleveland showed up tonight!!! DAWG POUND. 6-3 record. I called it! Who woulda thought?
Then people wonder where the disconnect is
There's no way in hell. Cause I see one getting pushed away like everyday
I'm convinced that a good man that wants to have a good relationship and work for a better one ain't what Yall really want.
It's crazy all the memes about no good bfs, what a good bf should do etc, but girls don't be pulling they weight either.
Not gonna lie this is the least involved I've been in politics. For alot of reasons.
Don't let anything get in the middle of you and your dreams. Like anything.
There's true power in learning how to maintain. Finding that balance
Gonna have to start doing 2 a day work outs. Been lazy lately
Watching scandal before work. Letting time pass.
Halloween has never really been a holiday to me lol
Cavs losing to the Knicks is garbage. LeBron should of been opening his season is Miami that's why he was all messed up.
The Thunder might as well sit this season out. They're gonna be in a nice little hole before either of there stars get back
Boo tryna put me on sushi tonight. I'm extremely hesitant. lol
LeBron James
People do not like hearing the truth about themselves sometimes.
I'm about to work my hardest with keeping in contact with people. It's not hard!!!
All day trainings are the worst!
@viscotee @_NothingNormal pass it to me too

@YuriyATL404 lol I saw that too. We have been losing a lot of games that we shouldn't have though
IF DRAKES 4th ALBUM IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE PREVIOUS 3 HE BEATS KANYE!
My sleep schedule got me ruined
If Drakes 4th album holds up with his other 3 he beats Kanye.

@TarikuSalim haha forreL cause the gifted wasn't
Drake really trying too be the only one in the game lol
@TarikuSalim lol forreal. I'm just waiting for wale to come through strong
@TarikuSalim true. His lyrics ain't always Ralph. His overall sound is though.
I got the most beautiful girlfriend in the world.
You got the same 24 hours a day that I do to be pproductive. That anyone does.
The supreme foams was tough.. The supreme forces.. Ehhhhhhhhh not so much
Crazy how even when shit miss you it'll still come back and get you.
Idc who you root for... Seeing D. Rose back on the court in full swing is a blessing. Bruh was unstoppable last night.
Fall back game bout to be righteous.
I need to get more sleep at night.
Oil change after work.. There goes my afternoon pretty much.
Fall/winter shopping needs to occur. SC is much colder than FL.
@OffTheeWall sighs
@OffTheeWall what yall doing ?
The desire of a man is his kindness and a poor man is better than a liar
The fact thought of brung home these next 2 months are comfortingggggggg
All I know is go get some and then get more. Relentless pursuit.
Nothing Even Matters At All
@OffTheeWall lol good job bird
Volunteer tomorrow starts at 5 am... And it's 30 minutes away from the crib. That's truly giving back.
@Monifaa_xo chilllingggggggg, how you been?
@Monifaa_xo <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Repetitiveness only equals progression when perfect your footing on one step to be able to take the next one. CHANGE is still essential
The unconventional methods sometimes yield the most results.
A crooked cop that gets the job done would always have a place in my unit if I was in command
Chanel Orange be the vibe tonight. Heard my dude was back in the studio. <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
Finalllllllllly back on Twitter. What's happening ???
Gonna have to hit the gym tonight. Been off my schedule
Not even tripping off the new iPhone.. What I have will do.
With the right focus. You'll be surprised what you can accomplish. The doors that you used to walk past that you should have peeked in
Forgiven.
This month is my month to give back. I have so much volunteer planned.
Sometimes you just hit that point where you know that your time is coming. Period.
Both of my suprise picks of the year balling ! My team is 1-1 right now
That boy cam newton showed out today!!
Gold Medal
&amp; this is why I gotta keep a circle of close friends around me.
I will live life with absolutely no regrets. Pray hard, work hard.
@OffTheeWall whatever you tell yourself so you can sleep at night
@OffTheeWall you be getting mad
@Quick_flash14 and you still think that's normal ?
@OffTheeWall lies told on twitter...
@POP_DK36 @Quick_flash14 did you see the pictures ?
I really thought the Giants was going to make noise this year.
None of y'all could admit to having the scars that that FIVE YEAR OLD CHILD HAD.. Black or not
@FeministaJones thinking before you speak is essential. The crime is colorless. Only a fool would attempt 2 draw that conclusion.
@FeministaJones the question makes no sense...
@FeministaJones why'd you ask this ?
@OffTheeWall <CRYING CAT FACE>
@OffTheeWall realistically narrow minded
@OffTheeWall i mean. Ok. Lol
@OffTheeWall cause you dare to not expand your mind.
@OffTheeWall so you just gonna drop out of the convo
@britttanyx3 @OffTheeWall yea. It's all sad. The beauty would be taking it back 2 old days. <MAN AND WOMAN HOLDING HANDS><FAMILY><OLDER MAN><OLDER WOMAN> start young, commitment throughout, &amp; chill
@britttanyx3 @OffTheeWall no. If you wanna separate the emotional jazz then 10=10.
@britttanyx3 @OffTheeWall neither side is acceptable tho. It's all peasantry. Ppl need 2 value themselves. No ones putting a ring on trash.
@britttanyx3 @OffTheeWall no doubt. Bt the emotional &amp; mental connections tend to lean towards the other side that's scientifically proven
@britttanyx3 @OffTheeWall guys going inside of her. Males usually don't have the same emotional and mental connection or tolerances
@britttanyx3 @OffTheeWall only difference between the male and the female, would be the girls emotional and mental allowance of all these
Never take a good thing or person for granted... #thankmelater
@LaBelleAmber really? You'll have to text me I want details! And nah for the most part mine are repetitive too. Just excited for school
That phone never rings when they got everything. Promise you that. Terribly ironic.
@LaBelleAmber I've been doing good. How have you been?! Your days have been more eventful than mine I'm sure.
Sunday is such a painful day! Lol. Gotta get back to the work week.
@LaBelleAmber lol damn.. Seeeeeee I figured
@LaBelleAmber ???
I put in work with Andy dalton and the bengals on madden
Whats ur favorite joint?? 
It takes time for someone to be all they need too. Takes certain factors to make the change more desirable than last time.
My heart hurts whenever long weekends are about to come to a halt
They been through enough though
Wade really went all out for his bride.. 5 mill on the wedding??
Kanye got the whole male A list in his mouth bruh
Every girl complains about it but it's a lot of girls that have the man that they need but will blow it
The truth Always comes to the light.. Just a shame when it does
Every now and then I like to get a new phone case.
Mature

We work hard so that we can afford to spend time &amp; money with those that mater most.
@OffTheeWall @Monifaa_xo lol
@OffTheeWall @Monifaa_xo lol forreal you better had said most niggas <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
@OffTheeWall "niggas cheat on pretty girls with girls that look like chicken nuggets....."
Gotta be the best version of me that I can be for you everyday
Someone to love &amp; to be loved by someone. Is that not the goal?
Lebrons new Samsung commercial is Ralph too me
Just feel like we should use what happened as a pedestal to talk about the things that really matter
@FreeTopher do black on black crimes make you just as upset?
At least you never had to ask.
@Wale CHECK YOUR IG.. LOOK FOR MY TAGS.. Don't want this to be a #rantboutnothin
YALL ATTENTION: CAN I HAVE THAT?? 
All we wanna do is take the chains off....All we wanna do is be free...
Bout time yall start taking shots at whitey.. First day of school GPA zilch.. Last day negros got 3.5s and higher. blow their minds
It's a shame the conversations black parents have to sit down and have with their sons
Its a shame that we have to stand in our own blood, knowing who forced the first drop to shed and have to plea to be truly heard
At this point there's nothing else that I'm going tweet about
51% of crack users are white but 95% of the inmates in jail for crack usage are what color?
Its a stress that we all should feel. Next it could be you.
@JColeNC was clearly moved &amp; heavily impacted by Browns death..
It's funny how y'all don't run up and shoot the serial killers, rapists &amp; molesters. Y'all actually wanna get to know those crazy mofos
First news report would have the black cops name next to the white victims name, grade point average, &amp; favorite hobbies. #FUCKEM
LET ONE BLACK COP GET TURNT. AND I BET THE SOCIETAL LYNCHING WOULD BE TELEVISED!!
LET ONE BLACK COP FORGET THAT HE HAS A FAMILY AND FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ALSO HAVE FAMILIES...
Let one black  cop forget the words that define the uniform and car he drives...
Let one black cop use the same methods for exploitation and justifications....
Let one black cop choose to use the same "authority" that white cops think is extended to them...
Its no longer enough to say you wanna win you gotta learn the game .



RIP Michael Brown
We have to take our education serious, take our finances serious, take our men seriously, value our women appropriately.
We gotta first learn to respect, value, and appreciate ourselves before we ask any other race or culture to do their part...
Jews and Blacks faced similar oppressions and its puzzling the level their at vs where we are..
On the things that matter such as our faith, education, &amp; the issues in society that matter to us.
Only way we could level the playing field is if we work twice as hard
Fergurson police were equipped with $1 billion worth of military gear but it costs to much to put cameras on all the cop cars?
Ha. Cause if you leave it up to the news channels youd be missing out on a lot f the truths
Of course people tweet about these matters for the attention, to get convos started and retweets circulating
This week is a big one for me. No lies.
&amp; this is why I just don't cheat lol
Anyone know how to activate windows??
Don't know why y'all think white men will be the answr to y'all problemos
If I was home... I'd prolly be at bay bays chicken &amp; waffles with the crew.
Relaxing on a Friday night.
If twitter and all that played no relevance in how news moves in this nation.. Why does every network have one?
Obama might not read your tweet... But lifting a voice is lifting a voice.
Black officers name would have been released to the public. Lynch mobs in his front yard.....
It takes 2 to tango...
My luck has been awful the past couple days. We still pushing though..
If y'all are retweeting these memes of robin Williams drawn with mike brown.. PLEASE STOP. It's disrespectful..

If KD gets 325 million dollars over 10 years to wear some sneakers I have no idea what I'll do. #mindblown
Some blessings if mishandled will be lost to you. &amp; you'll have no one to blame but yourself cause God dealt you a good hand.
Ok my name Wale prolly know me from the you know!
Imma try to keep in close contact with the consistent people in my life. The ones I can grow from.
Got a goal in mind so I'll keep working. That's all..
Could never say I didn't give it my all.
I'm constantly trying to be a better child of God.. Better son, brother, boyfriend, professional, mentor, friend the list goes on...
I think everyone should make that a daily goal...
I'm constantly trying to be a better version of myself...
ESPN will be boring for just a little while longer..
Im not the kind of person to be like it has to be this way, but when its not, I just like to know &amp; understand why.
If I hooped... DC hyper dunks all season. Buuuuuut I don't.
Spend less &amp; save more. What you have enough...

@YuriyATL404 Which is why the Western Conference is so much more entertaining. I like the way the Wizards are rolling too.
Anyone know where I can catch some USA hoops coverage or is it to early ?

@charismashaw petty lol
@YuriyATL404 yeaaaaaa man that you aren't lying about. Hope the pistons can muster up a better season
As old as we are now, if you listen to ambitious girl, as a woman, and can't connect? You ain't ready. What you got to offer?
If opposites attract then why are we fighting over our differences?
Hate when people say they feel me.
I wish you learn to love people and use things, and not the other way around.
@OffTheeWall @sneakz91 @flightt0london I'm just saying clearly he's been here before. So yes.
It's clear that I'm stuck between I want it and I got it.
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow?
I know we were going through some shit. Name a couple that isn't.
If I ignore all that advice and something isn't right then who will I complain to? @sneakz91 @OffTheeWall @flightt0london I <EAR> y'all. I sorry
Never call the game before the buzzer sounds. Even when you're up by 19 with  2 mins left.
We working. 
And if you do it correctly no one should have to fight for the upper hand.
our generation needs to understand that the man as the body &amp; the woman as the rib are the God given roles. Is what it is.
And instead of calling one mind dumber than the other just understand that there's a difference and move forward..
We catch different hints, we see things different, we hear the same direction and go about doing them differently
I feel like once both sexes understand that our minds are wired diff we'll alll be better off.
Ha. All the one liners in days in the east are tweet able. I promise they are.
@amourdezjaa that's the only way too be! There's Somebody out there who will value you, for you. Until then just keep doing you! <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
@YuriyATL404 true. But they won't be a winning squad until the cavs and the heat go
@YuriyATL404 solid role player I'd say.
@YuriyATL404 Atlanta is the team that... I mean at least they're in the playoffs every year.
@YuriyATL404 but they got Lin, boozer, young, Kobe.. One or 2 shooters.
@YuriyATL404 they picked up some descent pieces. It sucks they aren't in the East <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@YuriyATL404 I would love to see kobe put up one last good fight.
@YuriyATL404 man I'm trying to save the spot for lakers at worst.
But I guess that's just the motion.
@YuriyATL404 hmm Idk man. The western conference is hard as hell. The 8th seed is a dog fight.
You want and want and want but you don't give shit. <FROG FACE><HOT BEVERAGE>Ô∏è
People always making lists of what they want from life but don't wake up in the morning, don't apply for jobs, don't do their work..
I've never changed. Motives, morals, desires, fears, truths, lies. It's all me consistently. If you feeling differently it's self imposed.

You're loyal to what you wanna be loyal too. No one held a gun against your faithfulness, no one held a gun against your choice not to be.
It's more than just general "communication". You have to be willing to learn HOW to communicate with diff people
Seeeeeen it all.
@YuriyATL404 the man was funny. Hosts are hit or miss I think he held up pretty well.

Came back from 16 to win by 5 lol. Lil 2k tourney was live. Now off to the gym <FLEXED BICEPS>
luol deng to the HEAT!!
Melo run &amp; gun style should of went bCk to the west.
The Heat need to pick up James Ennis. Go from a superstar based game plan to a team based. There in the East anyway.
Hardly knew any of the black people at my school I'm quickly learning. Lol
Def wanna play for some leagues off base. Can't wait to get unchained
@OffTheeWall lol. Respond to my text.
Undertaker would be the only reason Id watch WWE other than the rock.
@TarikuSalim @JefeRaps I second that
iPads, or any tablet for that matter are essential.
@OffTheeWall seeee I'd have to degree lol. What was Wayne's rock album? Kanyes was better but it was the same effect to me.
Studying &amp; the World Cup have been the majority of my weekends but once I pass this test! ...<WINKING FACE>
@OffTheeWall wasn't terrible.. Showed his musical range. Just wasn't his best project to me.
Twitter would probably be funner if I subscribed to all of my close people
Some foul shit in the air but I ain't gonna sniff it out
They tellin me not to do it!
KANYE WEST WILL BE THE EQUIVALENT OF DWYANE WADES CAREER WHEN WERE TALKING LEGENDS YEARS FROM NOW.

Pharells humility level is admirable
Oh how we love to move with the movement
Ignorant quantities thrive while subtle qualities are left to starve. Here's to our generation.. Our culture..
Bout one of the stupidest things that airs on TV...
My dislike for reality tv shows is on like 1000
Mondays are  my officially avoid twitter days.
Women do a lot of complaining but whenever a good guy is giving his all it's the woman that screws it all up. <EYES><EAR> or nah?
Ready to hit the road. Jax this weekend lol
@amourdezjaa gotcha!
@amourdezjaa I haven't been too bad. Just working. And that's good to hear!
@amourdezjaa lol I feel you. how you been though ?
Ay Trust yall! the hornets aren't dumb. clearly they might see some more talent elsewhere with the pics that they were just given
@amourdezjaa lol it's not. I'm just jiving.. What's up though?
@amourdezjaa lol why you doing all this on social networks??
Marcus Smarts acne level is on OD. Lol. That brother is nice though!
@YuriyATL404 chalmers needs to go anyway
@YuriyATL404 it's a start. Guard &amp; center positions need to be replaced for the Heat. &amp; Napier is better than cole even if behind chalmers
Trade Chalmers for a bigger guard and if we get napier we could lose cole too honestly.. The man doesn't score enough
Hope he comes to the heat.. I have no idea why they haven't put chalmers on the chopping block yet
Napier didn't get picked yet?
All these teams are trading talent away to clear cap space. I hope they know only 3 of them have a real chance at bron or melo
Work work work.. It's almost the weekend tho! <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>. Night y'all!!
Y'all worship a Thot.. And all these thotty thots going crazy over a convict. #welcometosociety #nochurchinthewild
@footlocker idk if you guys have the direct line or something but please let Nike know it's not to late to change the LeBron 12 design.
As a culture we need to redefine our thoughts on what's luxury and whom we deem worthy of determining our own self esteem
I really want the Heat to get Napier. If he's able to score in the league. Charmers and Cole Can go on the chopping block
Worry bout your character not your reputation. Your character defines who you are. Your rep? Just what ppl think of you, which never matters
I'm not the biggest soccer fan.. But I always watch the World Cup
Damn! Portugal scored. Don't know what happened.. Like the goalie just collapsed.
Tuned into this game. #TeamUSA
On Sleepless nights I just start working on shit to take my mind off things.

@RL_Girl1 lol forreal. I moved down from tally.

Well this is awkward...
Will any of the females remaining with standards and self value please stand up and make yourselves known. YOURE THE REAL MVP.
My back bone is full grown it's just how I was raised. &amp; I always stand on my own 2 feet.
@footlocker how &amp; when is the winner chosen for #CruzDayTuesday ?
@TeamVic #CruzDayTuesday #Kickstagram 
@TeamVic @footlocker how?
Mann I shoulda known.
Back at it.
They took Lebron out. That's ball game. There's no competition in the East though. They'll be back.
Bron prolly ain't leaving though. Heat gonna have to make some moves though.
Even if Lebron wanted to claim he's doing everything by himself. Hes not doing as much as he could
It's all his fault if you ask me.
Coach Spo finally letting Beasley play. Like he ready for the finals after not playing all year.
Nothing like finding out you've been being lied too by someone you trust.
From a business standpoint you gotta make the right moves
I need to find some khaki pant joggers for cheap. Dude tried to charge me like 90 for em.
There has yet to be a female to come out with an album better than the Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.
This is like the worst time of the year. Especially for sports.
Hopefully the Miami Heat take the right steps towards making history tonight.
‚Äú@alexislorde: A nigga CAN love 2 bitches at once, TRUST!‚Äù Nah RT
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Heat will be the first time to come back from being down 3-1
You gotta be a giver &amp; a taker. Never just one or the other... But especially not just a taker &amp; that applies to everything..
@AJ_BankSy @TaylorsLaFlare @UATheFirst jay jiggle
Need some good study tips.. Whose got a few??

You'd never have to worry about me being a diff me. Consistency is one of my trademarks.. Everybody else though, like a fish out of water.
Overly focused it's far from the time to rest now.
@laronisraw Imma fan of the newer construction styles such as the fly knits.. And performance wise I know a lot of ppl tht like the XX8s
@laronisraw what was your reasoning?
Might just have to cop 2 pair.. These joints are ridiculous. 
Imma have to just do what I can until I can do what I want. Progress is progress.
My job is wayyyyyy to boring lol. Can't wait to start classes.

@FallForSummer <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
There's 2 sides to that story.
MY QUESTION IS. What happened to the women that would do any &amp; everything for there man? I always see shit talkin bout the opposite.

If you're not wifey, fam, or a close friend. Meaning we talk 2-3 times a week. Don't hml for shit. No money. No favors. No advice. NADA.
@KevinHart4real is actually responding to his fans tweets. Humble as hell. A lot of people don't do that.

@ScottWilliams they're unstoppable when both Westbrook and Durant are poppin. Might be a lil struggle if one of them calls off.
@pretty_haynes yea that's my thing too. I despise the pacers though so I want the wizards to win the series
@jordanxrse it's his time man! <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
@pretty_haynes they're gonna get torn up next series though.
@ScottWilliams you think the thunder are gonna pull it out?
Working night shift keeps me from watching all the games. <UNAMUSED FACE>
I had to have this 5s.. I shoulda got the galaxy or the HTC 1.
But.. Even if they lose.. If they have a good off season them boys will be back.
All the wizards need to do is find an answer for Lebron and we will have a gooooood series. They won't though lol. Boy was born beast

That was a bold move by Silver.. Well played though.
Maybe if people weren't always so busy  trying to hide the elephant in the room they could figure out how to get him out the house.
On the west coast Damian Lillard is that deal though.
The Pacers were supposed to be the Heats kryptonite but they are falling apart.

The obsession with social networks is for single people or people whose lives aren't really that exciting.
Since when could horses talk anyway. SMH

@ComeBackKidd17 You already know. Destination in route. Hope there's water on the other side. lol

@pshh_domii that's the Navy for you lol. Smh
@pshh_domii I tried calling you fool. Im going to put some work in around like 3:30
Kap gonna put those BEATS headphones to good use after this loss. HAHA
Sherman just let the world know whats really real..lol
Great game!!!! Football has been too clutch this season. Some of the best games.
@iiGot_Dimples IDK where he lost it at. Graduation was his last solid effort. This last album had some mean beats but the content was ass
SEATTLE SEAHAWKS TOO THE SUPER BOWL.
@iiGot_Dimples Wish Kanye would go back to making these kind of joints.
Missing my baby.
Close game. Seattle D gonna have to hold it down.
Pressure makes diamonds. Life aint easy. Deal with it.
Only a 2 day work week this week. Thank God for these blessings. And get to go home at the end of this week.
Kap is going to hard tonight lol
Lineman be happy as all get out when they get a chance to touch the ball.
This game is gonna be a close one!!
Seattle really needs to pick up the pace. They should have more points on the board.
#GODSPEED
Glad to see Rondo back on that court.
We all have choices to make in life. I try to make the right ones. Ish still happens.
Starting to pack this weekend.. Yayyy.
J. Cole dropping a Warm Up 2?? BRUHHHHH *falls out*
My friend group is too strong to not be trying to do something productive with them. Sorry not sorry.
I kind of shocked that LeBron said he was jealous of Durant's field goal attempts. They play for 2 different style teams.
BIG TEST tomorrow. Major studying!
We can't make excuses just gotta make it happen.
@2underscores__ @HellaFaded_ next season if the panthers don't lose their drive.
@SloowMootion lol.... well.. I appreciate the concern. yall wont beat the Seahawks though!! Cam just doesn't have enough weapons.
@2underscores__ @HellaFaded_ im saying the panthers defender pretty much let Kap walk in the end zone.
Welp. 49ers v Seahawks might be the best game of the year. I got Seahawks though.
Whether the Panthers end up winning this game or not. Panthers GM needs to put in some work this offseason.
@2underscores__ @HellaFaded_ the play where Kap ran 4 the TD was  BS. 29 pretty much brushed his jersey off for him, for the cameras
@HellaFaded_ @2underscores__ that's what ive been saying.. I like olson, I like steve smith too. but he still needs more.
@SloowMootion yeaa its proving to be pretty tough. Hoping Carolina can toughen up. Defense not holding it down, o-line not holding it down.
Worked out with 2 Captains today. Learning curves. #rollwiththewinners
@HellaFaded_ @2underscores__ he doesn't have a whole lot of weapons either
@SloowMootion all in all it's gonna be a good game.
@SloowMootion nooo way. Did you watch the Panthers this season. This should be Cam's defining moment.
@SloowMootion Ohhh dear lol. That wasn't the right choice.
Who yall got winning ? Panthers or 49ers??
Gotta get back in time for this Panthers game though.
Sick as all get out. still going to the gym
@campos_arianna Funniest tweet I read all night
$2,000 purse but you got no cash in it.
Fierce Melon might be one of the coldest Gatorade flavors out there.
I'm a Falcons fan so the Saints just cant win. Cant happen.
Finally out of class. Were turnt up for this Seahawks game. Wanna see Russell Wilson come out on top
In some pain right now. But it's all love though. Keep pushing.

SEC is prolly the best conference for football.
This isn't Auburns first rodeo under these circumstances.
@AltoriaKhalifa halftime now. They finished strong. For your sake lets hope they can hold the momentum.
@AltoriaKhalifa auburn will win this game. Dont believe me just watch.
I'm wide awake and FSU still losing
@AltoriaKhalifa this y'all 3rd or so forced 3 n out. Y'all can't even score the football! You right they do have the 2nd half.. I guess.
They shoulda called holding on FSU right there.
They don't hAve the experience..
There's no hope for FSU.
@AltoriaKhalifa siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiikkkkkeeeeeeeeeeeee
FSU WILL LOSE THIS GAME. Sorry not sorry.
Most times you know when you have a good girl, don't drag her through hell 2 say I appreciate u later.. Show it from the start.
Class is out! Bout to get this work in with my bros. #itneverstops

@sneakz91 @OffTheeWall one day is a long time! trying to act up! lol and yea I know bro I been doing the same thing.
@OffTheeWall @sneakz91 lol I saw the dm. ill call you like 30 minutes or so.

@OffTheeWall @sneakz91 guess yall don't know nobody no more. its cool though.happy sunday and what not. may the lord continue to bless yall
2k looks like the move for the rest of the night.
If he really wants you in his life yall will not go through the same issues more than once.. maybe twice. No more than that.
The Colts game was too turnt. This Eagles game is taking way too long to turn up.
I brought my car back and have yet to find a reason to drive yet. The base is set up pretty nice lol
Feels good to be back to work. The grind always feels good.

I want some beats but I don't use headphones enough to justify the purchase.
Most of yall just needed discipline as a new years resolution.. That would take care of all the other stuff yall listed.
I cut so many friends last New Years if I lose any this year I'll be lonely!
One of my last nights home. Packing.
I got some sweet gifts. But the real gift this holiday season was having money to hook my family up too.
Christmas should really be swell this year. :). Did a lot for everybody.
@OffTheeWall @sneakz91 lol I mean. we should do secret santa for Christmas next year.
@OffTheeWall tragic lol. Me @sneakz91 never got a gift.

Youre mine, You're mine.
We all take ill advised risks praying for good results. Always good intentions.
Realists trust no one cause you never wanna be on the wrong side of things when ish gets realistic.
When you always around strangers that's when you find the value in having your kin folk around you.
Im praying for you boo and Idek you. That's just the results of asking myself what Jesus would do.
It Takes time for greatness shawty. We all gonna make it though. I pray for that.
I like when money makes a difference and doesn't make you different.
Jhene Aiko be on one too.
