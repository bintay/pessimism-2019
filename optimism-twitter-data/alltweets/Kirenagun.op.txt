@Enny_Tilde oh

I didn't know share play was a thing

we did it the old fashion way, by logging into their account on my PS4
@Evertrasify @folyqa he said friends................
@Enny_Tilde the fuck

all my friend's owned physical games weren't available for download, did I do something wrong?
@Enny_Tilde oh

@Enny_Tilde didn't you do that too, though?
@Enny_Tilde @folyqa IT'S DIGITAL

Do NOT buy MKX for PC

SAVE YOURSELF
@SoulsOnWheels wait and see if it gets better
or get it on sale for like 5 bucks or something

if you have a console though, get it for that
@Filippus_ It's a great game, just not on PC

@DestroyedArkana This shows up in my mentions fine?

@_watsu It's pretty great
@stalkeralker Hyvää iltaa.

what it does:

locks the game at 30 fps 
@Silkylinks more like rotten steak that was never cooked to begin with
I too love paying for unfinished pieces of garbage that won't work properly until 3+ weeks after release 
@Abzol ok
@meanbeandean why would they?

and how would you make it up to people who bought it?
What a piece of shit. 
@ennuist_ stop qq :)
This guy apparently lost his saves even though he didn't download the patch yesterday


@Rukasu_Mizukiyo it was just starting up

@Sanobearon 1 free one

that's been on consoles for like 2 weeks now
M-maybe this one will be different..... 
@Enny_Tilde it's had so many problems that what you mentioned would be considered a really minor one
@DoubleDiggur iktf

fucking feminists turned me into an anime girl
@doubyadee no, but alot of people did

apparently if you didn't launch it didn't take your data
@Enny_Tilde c'mon, you can do better than that, Enny
@doubyadee AGAIN?
@DoubleDiggur medieval people were dumb
w-what's the worst that could happen?

PLACE YOUR BETS

WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT THIS TIME?
HERE WE GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

well shit
stop subtweeting eachother
@DoubleDiggur see ya in 2050, when I finish them
@DoubleDiggur I really should

I keep forgetting to
@DoubleDiggur Oh yeah, it is pretty interesting, but I just think that if you'd have to label him, he'd be chaotic good, anti-hero
@DoubleDiggur Isn't that a textbook anti-hero?
@DoubleDiggur I wouldn't even call Accel a villain

antagonist is more fitting, I think
@folyqa NICE
@folyqa what was it?
@pigsdofly6 inb4 he's the main character
JUST LET IT DIE

FUCK 
@pupHime me neither
@pupHime @doubyadee it also has alot of filler and changes minor events, I hear
@doubyadee oh yeah those too

I hear they were terrible
@doubyadee it only covers the first 2 or so arcs though
@doubyadee I haven't seen the old one, but I hear it's good aswell.
@Conchubhairrat just wait until you get to the napkin drawings
@Conchubhairrat I liked the jojo anime more than the manga too, the music and voice acting went a long way
@Conchubhairrat In my opinions, yes.

If you play Bojutsu Kung Jin, you have no right to call any other character "Easy"
@Avisch_ it recently went f2p, I think

@Mythrrinthael @JohnnyColourman @DoubleDiggur @maou__desu Goodbye. 
"Goodbye." 
Hey guys remember this game?

I wish I didn't. 
@Mythrrinthael @JohnnyColourman @DoubleDiggur @maou__desu With ESO?

How about that Talos didn't shout to clear the forest shit in Cyrodiil
@DoubleDiggur @JohnnyColourman @maou__desu @Mythrrinthael here we go 
@JohnnyColourman @maou__desu @DoubleDiggur @Mythrrinthael he did say that

silly as hell

But I think todd howard went "lolno" to it too
@maou__desu @DoubleDiggur @JohnnyColourman @Mythrrinthael lol

@Avisch_ @kitsunecass SHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUN
@kitsunecass Never been a fan
@meanbeandean I've never seen any of them
The Jason intros seem really generic and uninspired

though I guess you can't have much banter when Jason doesn't talk
@folyqa I imagine the full list for MKX is just A LITTLE bit longer.
Guys, I think I get it.

The PC version of MKX is just a giant ad for current-gen consoles!

IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW
@pupHime neither did anyone else until really recently

Sheev Palpatine
@pupHime it's his name
@pupHime SHEEV
@Filippus_ @steinuil 
@seqilol @folyqa yeah you're right, your tweets gave me PTSD
@folyqa @seqilol so I wasn't the only one who thought of seqi when I saw this
I just wanted to play my "excuse for senseless gore and violence" 

IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK ;_;
@stalkeralker AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Like, seriously

DO THEY EVEN TEST THIS SHIT BEFORE SENDING IT OUT
:^)


@YamazakiJones Ah, he seems fun.

Scorpion is apparently top-tier while Mileena is too unsafe

Or so I heard.
@Irori_no_Yaya I did that a while back when I first heard about some people losing their saves

so hopefully I'm alright
@YamazakiJones I've been playing Raiden the most, so far.

You?
@Irori_no_Yaya and you didn't have it backed up?

I'm so sorry, man.

When I open tweetdeck on chrome it uses up 95% of my cpu

@Mythrrinthael @maou__desu tumblr and their headcanons

it'd be hilarious if it wasn't so horrible

@D_Scarecrow you're welcome

@iamdroflet YUB NUB
@CaptainArms @DoubleDiggur it was only a variant cover because of the anniversary
Man, MKX was so subtle about having a gay character!

Perfect chance to get UNIEL

Pretty great game. #LRT 
@Silkylinks I've been wanting to do this forever
@ambiguousrocket would that be incest though?
@EmmyaShirou casko wheeeeeeeeen

@Silkylinks Ahh, okay then.

I think I understand now.

Thank you so much for your help man
@Silkylinks - and download the game

do you need to make Person 2's console the primary system or something?
@Silkylinks is the game sharing process any different than the PS3 one?

on PS3 you just log in to Person 1's account on Person 2's console
@Silkylinks - have to be logged in to Person 1's account to play the game, correct?
@Silkylinks Hey, I've got some questions again buddy

So the account restriction doesn't apply to Person 2 in this case, right? He doesn't -
@ennuist_ @ambiguousbasil classic
Twitter: Tech Support
@Silkylinks Well, that's not TOO BAD, I guess.

Thanks for the help homie.
@Silkylinks - sharing the game?

Just wanna make sure I get this right
@Silkylinks So if person 1 is sharing a game with person 2, but has 2 accounts, he can't play the shared game on the account that isn't-
@Silkylinks wait so, the person sharing just can't play that game, or all his games on other accounts on the same console?

I'm kinda lost
@EmmyaShirou FATE ZERO WAS SO MUCH BETTER OH MY GOOOOOOOOD
@Silkylinks Wait, so if you wanna gameshare a multiplayer game and play with eachother, you can't?
Can you gameshare on PS4?
@ambiguousbasil Yeah, even before he blocked me I was considering unfollowing since he didn't tweet anything of value imo
@EmmyaShirou budget though
@ambiguousbasil pretty much

he wasn't always like this though, which makes me sad

he also blocked me for no apparent reason a while ago
@ambiguousbasil man what happened to that guy
@stalkeralker mortal Kombat
@doubyadee yeah, just unlockables
My MKX bugged out yesterday, I could spend as many koins as I wanted without my actual amount decreasing.

Can't get it to work anymore.
@stalkeralker ah

Was it the second time that he just didn't play at all?
@stalkeralker I saw it live

fucking christ man

I think he was matched with him twice even

@DoubleDiggur depends on the mushroom imo
@fangbreaker yup

same with Johnny for me, he's actually pretty bro-tier in this game
@fangbreaker I've never been a fan of him, but they really nailed his dialogue in this game
@fangbreaker Kano has great intros

@badboykevin420 you need some mouth to mouth actions man
@badboykevin420 why?
@ventPup oh okaaaaaaaaay
@badboykevin420 never
@ventPup kinda curious who it was, but maybe it's better if I don't know

@misterbonkers_ moshi moshi skelly desu 
@misterbonkers_ end my suffering
@ventPup damn, that's harsh

some people, I swear
I know and care way too much about Mortal Kombat lore/story 
@fangbreaker Who cares, it's fun!
@fangbreaker Ye, I feel ya

All I'm saying is that they seem to have toned down how ridiculous the endings are and some MIGHT be canon
Discussing canonicity in a fighting games story
@fangbreaker the MKX endings happened
@fangbreaker some of them might be canon continuity-wise. Who knows when the next game will be set, but I wouldn't be surprised if some of-
@fangbreaker Yeah, I know, but the endings in this one (for the most part) aren't as over the top extreme as previous ones. I'm just saying-
@fangbreaker the thing about the endings is that a lot of them seem like a plausible continuation to the story
@fangbreaker but alot of the endings line up, like the Kung ones, the Jax and Sonya ones, Kitana and Liu Kang, Raiden+Kotal+Scorpion etc
@fangbreaker likely outcomes and few contradict eachother
@fangbreaker also if you've seen the endings this time around, I'd say a decent portion of them might end up being canon as they seem like-
@fangbreaker &gt;never

now that's just not true

most aren't canon, but others are canon like this one for example 
@fangbreaker - to Lao and Jin's endings), or atleast I hope it is, while Liu Kang, well, y'know
@fangbreaker oh you mean liu

I think the old wise guy role fits Lao better and I even think his default costume might be canon (according-
@fangbreaker not in the current MK lineup

it's really hard to keep him as "mysterious" in the 3d era, I think
one problem most costumes in the game have is that the colour in the concept art seems to be lost in translation 
@Branchlord 
@fangbreaker I dunno, I'm a big fan of his his current design (non-revenant)

he looks really cool as an old wise guy imo
Most of the concept art designs look better than the stuff in the actual game

that fucking mask man 
man my timeline is dead at this hour

@TheAlfax What would happen if demonbane took off his mask?
MY FICTIONAL CHARACTER IS STRONGER THAN YOUR FICTIONAL CHARACTER

(unless yours is Demon Bane)
@CaptainArms It's all about the discussion man
@DoubleDiggur @CaptainArms Yup
POWERLEVELS
@DoubleDiggur @CaptainArms can be used to such a degree
@DoubleDiggur @CaptainArms I assume if he were to use it on accel's shield, accel might actually lose his ability to emit it

IF his power-
@DoubleDiggur @CaptainArms his power
@DoubleDiggur @CaptainArms what about Soft&amp;Wet?



On paper I'd say yes, but we don't really know the full extent of-
@DoubleDiggur @CaptainArms 

@DoubleDiggur well it's basically like Shiki's (Type Moon) death perception, so I assume you could creak the "shield" with it
@CaptainArms @DoubleDiggur yeah, but I don't think accel's reflect would work against it?
I'm so glad Shatterpoint is canon. Such a cool power.
@DoubleDiggur mkay, what about shatterpoint?


@CaptainArms @DoubleDiggur I think Tusk 4 and GER could both beat accel, but they're both pretty bullshit
@DoubleDiggur I suppose so

okay, what about jedi mind trick?
@DoubleDiggur if he force chokes him? does that still count
@DoubleDiggur Could Darth Vader beat accel through space magic? (aka the force)
@DuskReverie 
@DuskReverie woah woah woah don't do anything stupid, okay?

Let's all just calm down and enjoy a KitKat.... The way it's supposed to.
@The301st @CaptainArms @DoubleDiggur y-yeah..... 
@CaptainArms @The301st @DoubleDiggur I like the theory where dio's stand copied the joestar's, but that's highly unlikely

it's just ARAKIII
@CaptainArms SHINJITSU NI
Is there anything ever that could defeat this motherfucker right here? 
@DoubleDiggur the author does that all the time in jojo

just look at this shit, for example


There's been alot of Juri on my TL recently.

Not that I'm complaining, but 
@DoubleDiggur he breaks through because his stand has time stop aswell

I'm not even kidding
@Mythrrinthael @DoubleDiggur Oh yeah, definitely, but power level discussion is one of my guilty pleasures

it's just fun
@DoubleDiggur I'm only saying it wouldn't be active because jotaro's stand self-defence mechanism doesn't work in stopped time either

@DoubleDiggur well I think in jojo timestop his "shield" wouldn't be active, though I'm not sure
@DoubleDiggur imagine jojo time freeze
@DoubleDiggur could time stop beat accel?
@iamdroflet something star wars
@The301st @DoubleDiggur I reckon flash would win accel even in a straight 1v1, but yeah he is really bullshit
@The301st I bet every page was filled with dicks
@acex222_2 Should've just bought a console<TRADE MARK SIGN>, wouldn't have these problems! :^)
@pupHime yeah same

but they seemed really focused on the drawing part
@acex222_2 Hopefully it'll go away when I get my new PC parts
WOAH you can DRAW in your web-browser?!?!??!?!??!? COUNT ME IN


Ah, youtube comments. 
@Gradingus s2 never ;_;


Nichibros was so fun.


@badboykevin420 Excuse me

@DoubleDiggur same pretty much

unless it's something I really care about
@DoubleDiggur you highlighted it you dork
@ambiguousrocket @badboykevin420 I think they're neat

characters look pretty accurate to what was described in the books, although stylized
@Cidoku yes

I am the pokemon
@Cidoku what about girls pretending to be guys?

FOUR

HOURSSSSSS 


@folyqa lmao

"Waah MKX story mode didn't have as much pointless padding as MK9 did!"

ye, fight Sonya since she won't go on a date 
@Cidoku Nice weather haaaaaaaaaaaaaaah

@stalkeralker fair enough

I do find most fanbases really obnoxious though, but the smash fanbase is really loud
@stalkeralker nah not really

but I mean the people who scream and shout about how melee is the greatest game since nothing ever
@stalkeralker you mean meleebabbies?
bluh
gd nght

@TheAlfax mfw 
@TheAlfax I also liked it when Jax kicked all the revenants' asses
@TheAlfax Best moment in the whole story right there
@TheAlfax I'm gonna replay it when I upgrade my PC, so it won't be as jittery
@TheAlfax It was great fun, but I thought there were some story problems

@stalkeralker @halloptik @doubyadee oh cool, I didn't know

there's not a lot of married people on here, now that I think about it
@halloptik @doubyadee stalker is married?
shit I double clicked a tweet I was gonna favorite so I guess I'll just pretend I was joking and spam the favorite button

sorry WD
@halloptik not surprised, league is way more accessible
@Cidoku I'd treat you to mämmi if you ever did visit
@fangbreaker *cough* Frost *cough* 
@fangbreaker even then, why 2 Special Forces characters in the crew? Why not add a Lin Kuei representative instead of generic military chick
@Cidoku AND NEVER LEAVES
@meanbeandean quality tweet
@fangbreaker same with Jacqui, why is add her and keep Jax in?

what's the goddamn point?
@fangbreaker into 1 (Johnny+Sonya), but still kept both

for what purpose
@fangbreaker Takeda's default outfit is really boring, but his alt is alot better imo

what really gets me is that they fused 2 characters-
Poor Little Earthrealm Boy

@noobde @NetherRealm When will the PC version get the update currently available on consoles?
Eh, she's looking a bit better now, but her outfit is still really boring imo 
@soothingplumtea scum
@SaccharineFront As is the norm, sadly.
@badboykevin420 well considering that's what happened (to some degree) 
@johncolourman @TeleTemplar oh

oh no
@badboykevin420 well yeah it does, but you're not supposed to kill yourself over it
@johncolourman @TeleTemplar m-maybe it's a joke
@_fawky yupyup

if some anonymous coward tells me to off myself, you're damn right I'm not just gonna take it, just don't listen to them
@Cidoku don't those things cost money?

REAL money?
@badboykevin420 either they're joking or  you probably shouldn't like them and stop
@SaccharineFront Like, it's not completely aimed at this case, but more in general
@SaccharineFront So I hear, yes. But sensationalist headlines like this 
@_fawky I'm not excusing it, just saying that people are dicks because of anonymity, grow thicker skin
@SpyroTheGhost daaaaaaaaaaamn
Honestly, if you let someone telling you "kill yourself" on the internet get to you, it's probably time to stop browsing.
@badboykevin420 @folyqa I imagine the AMA Gaben did helped
@doyouevengrind nice  avatar
Sonya was a wasted character slot imo
@DoubleDiggur don't give them any ideas
@dojikkomeido nice ducks
@kitsunecass IMASOGAAAAAAAAAAAAY 
@kitsunecass Yup
@kitsunecass yes?
Well, I say "good guys", but what I really mean is the ones you played as.
What I didn't like about MKX' story mode is the amount of plot-armor the good guys had.

They made everyone look like absolute shit
oh, apparently a second season is gonna start on June 21

well shit
Finished True Detective

pretty good
@doubyadee what always gets me though is when you have to defend your right for disliking something

@doubyadee &gt;kire is edgy is a joke
&gt;ragna is edgy is a joke

YOU'RE RIGHT, I AM RAGNA
@doubyadee that was a "ragna is edgy" joke

@doubyadee oh

oh

hey, Ragna's still one of my mains, sooooooooooooooooooooo
@doubyadee hmm?
@doubyadee not at all

he's a womanizer and really aloof
"I have Anitwitter in my bio" 
@Cidoku &gt;Anitwitter in bio

oh, looks like I actually had him muted even though I didn't recognize him
@doubyadee fair enough

bullet and amane have zero character pretty much
@doubyadee His design is kinda eh, but I'm talking about his character, he's pretty likable
@doubyadee Kagura is cool, but the rest are zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
All the new characters in BBCP (except celica and azrael) are underdeveloped as hell

@wiltejkiel I don't think so, no

Oh, and I'm STILL waiting on that Block button.

@SlinkyDreams @OdangoKnight @Squidboy14 @CaptainArms well yeah, but he still wouldn't be able to beat GER, it's a stalemate
@SlinkyDreams @OdangoKnight @Squidboy14 @CaptainArms no because GER would nullify that action before it happened

c'mon man
@DoubleDiggur I'd go mad
@OdangoKnight @Squidboy14 @CaptainArms All Fiction is pretty much the same as GER afaik, I'd say it's an infinite stalemate
@DoubleDiggur 

@AwfeyTakarow 4 planets is confirmed though.

This twitter account is amazing @YourMainSucks
@YourMainSucks @Chiaisu
@ventPup that's a shame then, you'd think she'd realize it
@ventPup Huh that's kinda strange imo

I think I'd feel it's way too formal and strange to confide in a person referring to you by last name
@ventPup is that a common thing over there? afaik therapists over here have no problem using their patient's first name

@Evertrasify @meanbeandean yeah because what I'm lacking means I'm not gonna be able to play it without drops on lowest, you're right

@Evertrasify @meanbeandean 
@meanbeandean maybe he meant MKX specifically or something, I dunno
@meanbeandean they did?

where?
@meanbeandean ?
@meanbeandean yeah, it's pretty great gameplay-wise, but goddamn this port is fuckawful
@NetherRealm PC version still desperately needs an optimization patch.
@meanbeandean still get frame drops and shit
@meanbeandean yup, it's just the port

I'm a bit under "Recommended" because of my CPU, and I have to play with everything on lowest and -
@meanbeandean what are your specs?

@stalkeralker interesting

I dunno, when I started out I couldn't pull off a hadouken without completely following the gate
@stalkeralker how so?
@TheAlfax oh wow

Atleast it's not AS BAD as it was a week ago, shit was pretty much completely unplayable (still played the story, heh)
@TheAlfax drops on some stages (like the temple one with the rain)

time to upgrade my PC ehhhh
@TheAlfax I'm so sorry to hear that man

I can functionally play it, but I do get some drops here and there and sometimes really significant
@TheAlfax da bes

I didn't like how much they made him job in the story though
@ennuist_ 
you people keep tagging me with him

please stop
Sheep taking the high ground

Hilarious.

@DestroyedArkana @stalkeralker same
@stalkeralker @DestroyedArkana a genius that can't spell, apparently
@stalkeralker @DestroyedArkana yeah I just noticed it

I'm a genious
@DestroyedArkana @stalkeralker "a while"

It was honestly really discouraging at first, but as long as you stick with it you'll be fine
@stalkeralker fair warning, it's gonna be hell at first
@Mythrrinthael clearly you're a rapist

@Fizrik thank you
I don't like Filthy Frank, but this is perfect


@randomfox @fangbreaker @NetherRealm Honestly, MK4 introduced almost no good/memorable characters imo
@NotCidoku move to Finland and eat mämmi with me
Seriously @NetherRealm just give us Frost as DLC, I'd take her over Tanya any day.
tfw no Frost 
@folyqa nice memerino
Every time.


@DoubleDiggur I felt the movie trailer was pretty great, honestly

Who knows, maybe it'll be a good movie? I'm being casually optimistic
@DoubleDiggur I didn't really get anything outta the game "trailer" since they didn't show gameplay, I'm not getting my hopes up for it, but
@DoubleDiggur the movie or game?
@acex222_2 you ableist pig!

@EmmyaShirou yeah, that's what I'm worried about too, I'm reserving judgement until I see gameplay though
@EmmyaShirou &gt;no aim down

good, previous ones didn't have that either

I thought the campaign was gonna bridge the gap between ROTJ and TFA
@EmmyaShirou except EA

fuck EA
@EmmyaShirou like what?
@TheGreatReptar to be honest, they dug their own hole
@folyqa test your luck when
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
POP CULTURE REFERENCE
@doubyadee not like I'm playing online or anything like that, mostly just singleplayer stuff and test your luck against @folyqa
@doubyadee somewhat, it still looks and runs like poop, but it's kinda playable

These are probably the same people who complain about the new female designs and want back the balloon-titted ones from MK9

@MurderKube have you played MKX?
But so far I've enjoyed playing Raiden the most, I think
(this guy)


Haven't really gotten used to the game yet, regardless, I'm surprisingly not feeling Scorpion right now, hell, I even had more fun with WOOO
Shoutout to my homeboy @folyqa for helping me get MKX atleast somewhat playable (I can EVEN use my fightstick now!!)
oh, so apparently Kung Jin is gay, huh

Hsu Hao was the OG gay MK character though, may his soul find peace ;_;7 
@Saketan_ @acex222_2 been experimenting with Gan, aswell!
@acex222_2 but I agree
@acex222_2 that's hardly what Xe/Xir/Xin is talking about

@CaptainArms @maou__desu capcom loves jojo, just look at Juri 
Brutalities are great.


@solazz90 should've bought an Xbone<TRADE MARK SIGN>

@folyqa nice meme
Good afternoon.
Good night/morning
@noobde @NetherRealm Just finished the story mode. It was amazing! (despite the performance issues PC is facing right now)

Great job guys!
@CptSaltyPete comics: kotal was always blue
game: nah
@CptSaltyPete oh really?

well shit

but yeah, overall a fun story mode, but it was hampered by the PC issues ;_;
@CptSaltyPete also, any idea why completing the story unlocked Shinnok when he was unlocked from the start?
@CptSaltyPete oh yeah now I can tell you "I told you so" about havik, heh

Yeah, I kinda forgot about Fujin, really
Finished MKX story mode, it was fun. 

Too bad about the audio problems and graphic hiccups though, I'll maybe replay it if it's fixed.
@EmmyaShirou tomorrowwwwwwwww
@EmmyaShirou yes, but not right now

I'm play MKX story mode
@EmmyaShirou okay!!!
@EmmyaShirou hello
@EmmyaShirou ;^)
@EmmyaShirou I feel like he'd be really bland
@EmmyaShirou why do people even want SF Ryu? I don't get it
@OdangoKnight yes pls

@wiltejkiel @KingAlexanderk jokes aside, it's pretty expansive
@wiltejkiel @KingAlexanderk yeah, scorpion's a wraith and anyone can basically be brought back from the dead
@SlinkyDreams did you read Future's End?

kinda lame what they did to terry
@EmmyaShirou why don't you, it's not long, right?
@ennuist_ that was quite some time ago
@Frogsickness hey, I thought it was funny
@Frogsickness 
I'll probably catch up at some point though, who knows
I haven't read Prison School in months. I just got tired of it. It felt really stagnant and the pointless "drama" didn't help.
@NotCidoku same except the third part
@Mythrrinthael Played F-Zero X on the N64 when I was a kid, good times
damnit it orc-kun, you made me respond to someone I had blocked
@IntonerSRX @Mythrrinthael It's as if it doesn't matter since I've been wanting a new F-Zero for years now.
@Gradingus GX is so much fun
@yungpluto3000 I have mario kart 8 actually and I'd buy the F-Zero tracks if nintendo wanted to actually accept my credit card
nintendo stop making F-Zero tracks in mario kart and just make a new F-Zero, for fucks sake
THIS IS THE SHIT I'M MISSING OUT ON

FUCK


@Frogsickness @doubyadee What if I ask nicely?
@Frogsickness @doubyadee shame ;_;
@Frogsickness @doubyadee oh wow, you got a link?
@stalkeralker @MenacingMecha wanna be repairing it constantly
@stalkeralker @MenacingMecha I'm using a HRAP Kai (PS3) It works with PS3+PC, real good

just get something with Sanwa parts, unless you-
@stalkeralker @MenacingMecha any idea which one you wanna get?
@Frogsickness @doubyadee he was in a movie as a kid
@Branchlord *unless they use tweetdeck/sign out of their account/go into incognito

WHAT THE FUCK IS THE POINT 
@seqilol @folyqa 
@NotCidoku are you going to confess your love for penis now?
same thing @folyqa 
me and @folyqa trying to play MKX 
@Axelayer MK story has always been a guilty pleasure of mine, it's fun
I just wanted to know the story man... 
@moist_apple @stalkeralker NOT ON MY WATCH
why do people want fucking Ryu in smash, what the fuck
@stalkeralker @moist_apple IT YOU
@moist_apple erhem @stalkeralker 

And yes, I agree
I guess this is what I get for anticipating and being hyped for a game, huh 
@NetherRealm The game's story mode audio has horrible popping and crackling noises, which make even all the other sounds on my PC distorted
@Branchlord I WANT TO DIE
IT ACTUALLY MAKES ALL THE SOUNDS COMING OUT OF MY COMPUTER POP AND CRACKLE IS THIS THE REAL LIFE HELLO
I can't even play the story mode because there's horrible audio popping and shit

just kill me

why even live
@solazz90 @WillsShadow IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT 

@solazz90 @WillsShadow 
@WillsShadow @solazz90 
@EmmyaShirou I'll be here all eternity
@EmmyaShirou You could say he stole their

HEARTS

@WillsShadow I'm glad you asked. 

@NetherRealm I can't change my "Wireless" controller options without the game crashing. Is this a known issue on PC?
@folyqa just end my suffering fam
@DatDaisy it was really annoying when you were trying to spike someone, only to fast fall and SD
@DatDaisy so can you actually use the c-stick for d-air without fast falling?
@DatDaisy wait, what did they do exactly?
@CaptainArms OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
@EmmyaShirou Yes Emmy ;____;
@pupHime Science is just a theory :^)
@EmmyaShirou g-guess I'll go back to wanting to die then 
@EmmyaShirou JUST LET ME HAVE THIS OKAY
@EmmyaShirou e-enjoy those load times c-console p-pleb..............
@EmmyaShirou I don't

tfw no bloodborne
@EmmyaShirou oh yeahhhhhh

god bless the PS3
@EmmyaShirou I'd play that with you if I had money ;_____________;
@EmmyaShirou so I'd just wait for the to p-p-p-patch it
@EmmyaShirou PS3 version is coming later apparently ;_;

also, all their other games had launch issues on PC apparently, but run fine now
@EmmyaShirou o-okay

kill me
@EmmyaShirou in my IRL friend group I'm the only one who can consistently pull off fatalities (atleast last we played)
@EmmyaShirou ye I know

emmy pls, the joke was "meh, not that I even care, I JUST wanna die"
@EmmyaShirou but people with high-end ones seem to be doing fine

I'm just hoping to god the performance is one of the fixable issues
@EmmyaShirou what don't you believe?

people with better PCs than me are having issues with performance aswell, it might be one of the kinks
@EmmyaShirou Meeeeeeeeeeh, I wasn't really looking forward to it anyway, so it's okay, I just wanna die
@EmmyaShirou it runs like shit and I can't rebind my fightan stick keys
@EmmyaShirou because I can't play MKX ;_;
@EmmyaShirou ^.*
@EmmyaShirou ;)
@EmmyaShirou ;^)
@EmmyaShirou winky face
@EmmyaShirou hello
@folyqa I hope to fucking god they'll fix it
@folyqa it runs badly for you too?
@folyqa still fucked

yay
@folyqa is it still fugged?
Hello
@ennuist_ nini
@yungpluto3000 such a bad PC launch, really sad
@yungpluto3000 yup
@HonooNoFukai looks like he just wants attention to me
I just wanna  ̶d̶̶i̶e̶  go to sleep
I'm still alive (sadly)
@NotCidoku y'know, that one!

@PancakeSquid @FiandRAWR what 
@InfiniteEMP not to mention absolutely terrifying
What a mature developer.


@folyqa o-oh~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@folyqa go to sleep foly
the fuck is a "videogame feminist" anyway? 
@FatedSoulBlake All kinds

but generally I don't like pop music
@NetherRealm My PC is having trouble running MKX. Is this one of the "launch issues", or is it just my system that's too weak?

Thanks.
@doubyadee I'm hoping that's one of the kinks they're trying to work out or something

for example, I can't rebind my keys without a crash
@doubyadee random hiccups when alot is happening and stuff
Can I just fall asleep and never wake up

pls thank you
Problem now is that my computer sucks and the game's BARELY playable when I turn everything down to minimum and 720p 
My MKX wasn't working when it finished downloading it, but I verified the files and it seems to be working now! 
@maximilian_ Ah, alright. I didn't actually click the video in fear of spoilers.

Thanks for letting me know and apologies for the confusion
@maximilian_ Wait, Smoke is in MKX? You could've atleast waited a day for people to unlock the secret character if that's the case, imo
@EmmyaShirou they should blame valve, honestly

they "released" it early, which fucked it up
@TheGreatReptar afaik, yes
@EmmyaShirou Apparently the steam download is fucked for some people?
@NotCidoku it's cute
O-oh my... 
@IvanTyr @_watsu *cough* I really don't like 3rd Strike's char select music, it sounds way too much like shitty 90's music *cough*
@_watsu Though I suppose MK select screens never were all that colorfull, but the characters made up for it 
@_watsu okay to be fair, that pic is a bit much, but yeah
@_watsu well the select screen actually changes depending on faction, but it is pretty colorless
@_watsu though, to be fair, I never really did like the more "basic" humans in MK (Johnny Cage, Jax, Sonya, etc)
@_watsu That's the one thing that seems to be missing in MKX

WHERE'S THE DAMN COLOR
I swear to fuck if I don't get to play MKX today
@_watsu they're both boring special ops characters, their getup is really similar
@Filippus_ u wot
Undilluted spurdo-posting.

@pupHime Amazing.
@Auske5k @Frogsickness hu hu hu......
@MizukiGaming @Saketan_ What's happening on ps4? I haven't heard anything about it?
@maou__desu I could take ME2, if no one else wants it
@pupHime danke

I know someone who always misspells his name like this, heh
You probably should come back up for air if you're accusing everyone and everything for sexism/racism/whatever

literally drowning in tumblr
@The301st @maou__desu @CaptainArms "Choggles is creating shitposts!"
@doyouevenmind guess I just haven't given up hope yet ;_;
@Symmenix_ Really?

Atleast I haven't had that issue yet, we'll see though
@maou__desu sexy vimminz!!
Who even gets mad at fucking Mortal Kombat in fucking 2015, like goddamn
When you get blocked for sharing information

Probably for the best 
@soothingplumtea I hate people
How many of the Negative ones do you think actually downloaded the full game? 
@soothingplumtea SCUM
@shizuofucker69 It's not broken on PC though, and I haven't heard anything about any console issues?
@AwfeyTakarow gomen
@thundermont not if you pre-ordered :^)
@soothingplumtea Yup, that's the first thing that came to mind when I heard MKX was doing it
*clicks launcher*
*game doesn't launch*

WHAT A BROKEN PIECE OF SHIT I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'D RELEASE IT IN THIS STATE OH MY FUCKING GOD WOOOW
*starts downloading game*

Oh, look! The launcher is there! That means I can play the whole game, even though the client says it's 5% done!
@Frogsickness are pendants considered people though?
Okay, rant over

People are stupid
I D I O T S
Like holy fucking shit, "it's "playable", that must mean it's done!!!!!!!!"
MY GAME ISN'T WORKING WHEN I'VE ONLY DOWNLOADED ONE 5TH OF IT WTF????????????????????????
All these retards giving MKX bad reviews because they didn't download the full game.

Can they not read? 
@NotCidoku waiting for my "shitty excuse for senseless gore and sexism" to finish downloading

how are you?
@NavyPeels @The301st @Nuen_ go away memeboy
@G00dMorningJOE Se vaan ei ollut sama 5. kauden jälkeen ;_;

@The301st @Nuen_ &gt;liking noob 
@Nuen_ tfw no Shaolin Monks 2 featuring Scorpion and Sub-Zero 
@TheHoodedMan0 @Microsoft I don't hate Microsoft. I'm using Windows 7 right now.

I just don't care for the Xbone.
Even having the new Battlefront as a timed exclusive isn't going to make me buy your shit console @Microsoft

And that really says something
@WillsShadow @maou__desu the "good for you" thing wasn't a question
@WillsShadow @maou__desu yes, I know
@WillsShadow @maou__desu good for you?
"Timed exclusive" 
@WillsShadow @maou__desu it's EA, they'll never fix the issues anyways
@WillsShadow @maou__desu This isn't a good thing by any means though
&gt;Battlefront timed Xbone exclusive


@TheGreatReptar yeah it's a shitty business move, but it's not the second coming of hitler, move on

imo
@stalkeralker oh god

I thought it was neat that it became so popular when I was younger, since I even understood the words and stuff
MY SHINY TEETH AND ME


Wait, does the new GH only have 3 notes?

The fuck

Also don't buy it


I WENT INTO MKX AND DIDN'T HAVE A STAGE DOWNLOADED, SO I COULD ONLY CHOOSE RANDOM

THEN IT CRASHED
@pupHime how though

like goddamn, they tell you how to do them, it's not hard AT ALL
Like holy shit it's just a couple button presses normally

the worst part is that they actually thought there was a market for this
laughable


@_TheSion Normally evening is after 6pm, no?
@Nuen_ @Evertrasify fukken casuals
@Evertrasify why would anyone buy those though, you get them in-game
@Evertrasify what

@folyqa YO MANE DO YOU WANNA WATCH THE MORTAL KOMBAT MOVIE WITH ME BEFORE MKX HITS
GOOD NIGHT
@Squidboy14 the ones you don't include
@Squidboy14 prepare to make new enemies


Like, Tanya's never been all that interesting and her current design, frankly, looks like shit.
@fangbreaker shhhhhhhh
@fangbreaker I can read your mind
Honestly, they should just scrap Tanya and replace her with Frost in the new DLC
@maou__desu 
@maou__desu how generic
@Conchubhairrat Valentine? why?
@OdangoKnight nice selfie

@NotCidoku how dare you
@NotCidoku That's also been the case for quite some time, ehhhhh
@NotCidoku been like that for quite some time, I think
Like shiiiiiiiiiiii mane, it says April 14th, why does the day have to be 2/3 over before it's released

I blame Murrica
Suffering
why do I have to wait until like 8PM before I can even BEGIN to download MKX

With my internet speeds I probably can't play it before 12-ish
@folyqa inb4 you can't play it on your PC

@kiriribbon mine are still fully working, played with the not too long ago, but I REALLY, I mean REALLY do not want an Xbone

@DoubleDiggur @joey_jrpg SHIT I was hoping you wouldn't ask 
@DoubleDiggur @joey_jrpg stuff like that, I reckon
@DoubleDiggur @joey_jrpg I punched a girl once in middle school since she was bullying me, but that's about it

gender doesn't matter with-
@joey_jrpg @DoubleDiggur only part I didn't like was the constant "haha the girls beat up the boys" gags, but that's just me
@DoubleDiggur @joey_jrpg ever heard of nichibros?

it's pretty great 
@joey_jrpg @DoubleDiggur I still haven't seen that, actually
