Based on the walk breaks on mile three of my run, summer is here. #worthit
@_christina_ happy Mother's Day
@clnhll noooo. Your hair is great as is. One vote for no changes.
Her: Your strategy paid off. me: I didn't have a strategy. I didn't understand the rules.
@seldo already extinct in Manhattan
Had to watch Bull Durham to cancel out that ballgame last night. That movie is still a fountain of baseball wisdom.
@harperben and yet still hopeless. the worst part is seeing that the team doesn't know yet.
Can't remember a time I was this disappointed in the Braves. @harperben please teach me the zen of hopelessness.
@reliablespice @clnhll you beat me to the detergent joke
Overheard on this conference call: kill 2 birds with 1 stone was paraphrased "can we just kill everything?"
I turn my pill bottle over after my morning dose. This life hack eliminates my pill anxiety. Instead I worry I forgot to flip the bottle.
I'm conflicted between my natural aversion to the Apple watch and my natural affinity for  people that are blowing up my Twitter feed.
That moment when you give up on New Years resolutions in favor of bourbon and Netflix.
@_christina_ what's a newspaper?
@_christina_ haha. not kidnapped.
That time you meet an Internet friend after eight years and it's a great night.
@yoyoel I would go with a simple "just kidding"
@yoyoel "and thanks to @ccart31 who tweeted "finish the damn acknowledgments" which encouraged me to finish...."
@yoyoel write your damn acknowledgements! (I'm angling to get props in the acknowledgements to the acknowledgment section)
@clnhll oops. message @seldo I think he'll connect you. @seldo a request to login to the lgbt slack coming your way.
@clnhll join 
The weird thing about rewatching "you've got mail" is not that we don't have dial up. The weird part is we don't have bookstores.
Have cold = took Nyquil to avoid sore throat. Nyquil = woke up groggy. Woke up groggy = had caffeine. Caffeine = heart burn = sore throat.
Her: You have always been svelte. Me: Hahahaha. Tell that to my 2014 Resolutions spreadsheet and its polynomial order 3 weight trend line.
if you post click bait that links to a youtube of a tv show from last year, you are what's wrong with America and I will judge you. #Merica
@seldo you don't subscribe to these on general principle or you don't consider yourself a gay man?
That moment a week after Easter when your butthead neighbors spend the afternoon taking down their Christmas lights.
@maayanroth I feel weird any time I am in a meeting that doesn't pass the Bechdel test, which unfortunately is about 50% of the time...
Assess and Execs are tricky business words. I just got an email that a meeting was moved "due to exes visiting tomorrow". Haha.
@ccart31 HT @TheTweetOfGod which @harperben pointed out I was unduly (if subconsciously) paraphrasing in that last tweet.
when Walmart and NASCAR are opposed to your bigoted stance, you're in deep doo doo.
@_christina_ scary!
@_christina_ oops yes that's why.
@_christina_ is that why I hear helicopters and sirens?
@seldo I think about who gets out of the way often. It's like Americans never learned "stand to the right".
@seldo but is he worse than "Arrow"?
when they guy next to you has a cold in an open office cubicle, I feel like there is no hope for staying healthy. #cubelife
It's kind of like southern food. I love southern food, but I know one of the basic ingredients (besides sour cream) is bigotry.
A six year old living in a home VDOT plans to tear down just asked VDOT: "Can you not take our homes?"
At my first VDOT I-66 angerball meeting. They are idiots. I did get to shout "Come on!" when she said there is no benefit to us.
My life for the past six years would have been impossible for me to imagine. @gleeonfox made it a little easier to imagine. Truly grateful.
Crying for two hours. #GleeGoodbye #FinnHudson #CoryMonteith #2009
TIL: At the orchid exhibit at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum there is a flower called "Hot Pants Hot to Trot."
@SunOfSeldo but it's still dark outside when I wake up. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@saroy believe me you don't want to know <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@saroy plus side... precipitation that isn't SNOW thank the skies Spring is here!!
Is there a way to tell XLS that my formulas ALWAYS omit adjacent cells so get over it?  I don't need an error on every formula of my life.
I didn't mind getting my shoes wet while running today because with each "sploosh" I could hear the tiny cries of snow being murdered.
@maayanroth that is awesome. I've never seen that many candidates.
@maayanroth sometimes the best opportunities aren't advertised, and sometimes companies are just waiting for the right person. can't hurt?
@seldo imagine if you were trans
@seldo the last one seems blue to me but it also seems obviously faked in some way
@JamesSantelli you're not allowed to call someone "young looking" little jelly.
@seldo you now weigh less than me. congrats you big jerk! <WINKING FACE>
so many "news" reports are just links to twitter or youtube. I assume there exists actual reporting, but not sure how I would even find it.
@seldo I always say, the best way to not miss two days in a row is not to miss one day in a row! Great job!
@LaurenMikler @HuffPostLive yep. We had a photo album instead.
@_christina_ looks so yummy! <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
Even better than my 60 degree run in shorts and t-shirt is running past neighbors playing catch with their kids &amp; nerf guns galore.
Inbox zero for the first time in months. #dropsthemic #peaceout
@_christina_ is this so that she doesn't cross the picket line? Oof.
I hate critical people and have deleted them all. so now my Facebook is all happy nice people. which can be so irritating!! I think it's me.
@nickam0 I swear they back up more than they go forward. I'd rather just be killed by the damn thing backing up due to lack of warning.
I would pay $1000 for any device that blots out the sound made by construction equipment backing up. #neverendingconstruction #goinginsane
@_christina_ there was a football game on tonight
Everyone on earth is collectively asking "Why did they throw the ball??"
@yoyoel wait the puppy pees outside now?? proud papa!
@artemis1979 @maayanroth acceptable additions: Tomato, bacon. Use imagination (I've had grilled cheese with thinly sliced green apple)
@artemis1979 @maayanroth don't listen to Becca. start with butter in the pan. Butter bread with spreadable butter. Use mix of cheddar, swiss
@maayanroth in that case you have 100% chance of success.
@maayanroth guacamole is key. But it's simple to make. Add whatever you want, it doesn't matter how many layers.
@yoyoel I need to hear your Terry Gross story some time...
@_christina_ you're a better person than me... I need to run but I'm not going out...
the irony of being fb "friends" w/ every kind, smart, funny person you've ever met is realizing you don't have time to really stay connected
@_christina_ nope. nope, not running outside &lt; 32 degrees...
I've begun to use informal chat slang such as "Haha" in business emails. Signs of the times or signs of the apocalypse?
@_christina_ Success! I put out the garbage. Now I await finding out how I did this wrong...
The only thing worse than the self conscious angst of changing my profile photo is facebook announcing this as if I did it to solicit likes.
@seldo the internet suggests a pride of gays, or my preferred noun "a glitter of gays"
@_christina_ K normally does this task. I'm terrified of failing at it...
got up extra early today because Friday is trash day. only after my shower did I realize today is Thursday. #epicfail
@yoyoel your shit was lost but now it's found.
There is a movie on my list I wanted to rent at Blockbuster. I always think it would be great. 19 years, never watched it. #Netflixpurgatory
@_christina_ global warming!
@_christina_ you can't make me run again today! But it seems nice out... Had a lot of fun last night despite sobriety...
@saroy after my social media holiday I don't put up with that. I unfriended a bunch and also blocked all relatives. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@saroy really? My Facebook is fine. The key is unfollow... unfollow... and unfriend. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@yoyoel what's the return policy on crazy wormy dogs?
@_christina_ mine too!
Inspired by @_christina_ went for a run outside. My butt surprisingly did not freeze off. Thanks mittens &amp; hat! #coldalwaysbotheredmeanyway
@_christina_ possibly but I don't even know
@yoyoel the dissertation is not going to pee on your floor every day for the next six weeks.
one of my high school friends has a daughter who just got her drivers license. how is that even possible?
@nickam0 @yoyoel I guess it depends on how many snarky twitter comments Rye has. so far his instagram isn't very exciting. ;)
@yoyoel does he have his own twitter and instagram yet?
it's starting to be that time of year when I wonder... when do pitchers and catchers report? #baseballblues #braves #rebuilding
Fuming because @amazon has made "1-Click" purchase the ONLY option for digital content. Now I can't select my method of payment. Irritating.
@seldo this seems to be a show about everything I've ever heard about but have never related to. so I think we're in the same boat.
@nickam0 both seemed totally out of the blue, and a little jarring. But I agree. Ouch.
@yoyoel it is now.
@yoyoel my favorite is "is there anything else I can help you with?" Um, that implies you were helpful with something.
@yoyoel mine is going on stage for a play and I don't know my lines.
@JohnnyGrubb impossible
@seldo thanks for posting that Laurie. Heartbreaking but crucial.
@_christina_ can you add workouts?
@seldo perfect use of the phrase, <OK HAND SIGN> but the apostrophe comes after the y in y'all. ;)
@seldo and yet what a lovely thing to these otherwise obscure guys to do. Let's everyone join in. ;)
@seldo somehow that makes me jealous despite your description as boring...
@seldo need to know more about this Warwick tweet. You really went there?
OH: @nickpick77 "I've never referred to 'this business' as pecks... But I don't work out" ht @emadeck
... 5. Phone is perfectly fine because we have so many empty boxes at the bottom of the stairs. #christmasmiracle #stuntphone
1. Taking empty boxes downstairs. 2. Too dark, use phone for light. 3. Drops phone down one flight of stairs. 4. Phone lands screen down.
In case you were worried, she still has the same number, but I'm not in her contacts so she didn't know who was texting. Lol. Awkward.
That moment you send a personal text to someone only to realize they moved and you have you have no idea if they have changed phone numbers.
facebook is weird. just replied to a group email that is over six years old. two responses in less than five minutes. haha.
@yoyoel weird that an ibeacon doesn't push bot buttons for you...
@DevonRogers33 that never happened to me ever at GT. Well done.
How do I tell Pandora I never ever want to hear "Baby it's cold outside" sung by anyone ever.
@_christina_ those were all @MrManMO ... Of course. <WINKING FACE>
"All about that bass" comes on (loud)@harperben "Hey who's messing with the Sonos?" A: I am! I love this song. @ccart31 hahaha
No longer annoyed by red lights. Only lights not red long enough to tweet. #needrobotdriver
@ccart31 downside of stalking amazon is seeing that lightning deal for the presents you already bought. #lightningremorse
@yoyoel I feel like that tweet merited all caps
@yoyoel OH MY GOD CORGI MANIA
I keep going to amazon out of habit even though I'm done shopping.
 #christmasaddiction
@seldo yeah that's kind of a great point. dammit.
@seldo what's the plot hole?
@SunOfSeldo when can we expect an update here? How bout a countdown till the worst is over?
@JohnnyGrubb that's why you are the programmer and I am the project manager lol
@seldo yes. Just practice saying versions of the phrase "girl you are working that outfit." Works everywhere for girls or guys.
Things I like about winter: Wool sweaters. &lt;end of list&gt;
Me: You have a hairless cat named after the riots in Missouri? Mel: Um, this is F-U-R-guson. #poortaste #tweets #walkingdeadnight
@yoyoel more critically why are there boobs on your wall?
@yoyoel oh god don't encourage Zac...
Is there a way to filter all internet so I never see news about Cosby again? Every headline just reminds me old people still have sex. Eww.
@_christina_ you're totally right. most big offices have rude men in them. women are not usually gruff, so get might shit for the big office
@harperben @_christina_ I see what you did there
@_christina_ ask @harperben if he takes shit about being small
@_christina_ I would definitely say that about a little man. But not a little person.
@_christina_ isn't that sizist?
Reading giraffes are in danger boggles my mind. I have self doubt squishing a spider. Who the hell would shoot a gentle beautiful giraffe?
That moment when you say "I was listening to a thing on..." And your friends say "...NPR?" derisively...
34 degrees and raining. All I wanted to do today was stay under the covers and watch Netflix. There should be a holiday for that.
@saroy poinsettias. Done.
All my Black Friday hopes and dreams are dashed as the only two things I wanted are sold out online and, presumably, in store.
realizing that baseball players who are retiring are younger than I am...
@seldo great job! alas, that weight was not lost. I have found it.
@LumiaUS why are you marketing the fit bit every day when all I want is for more people to have the Microsoft band?
@artemis1979 @maayanroth @yoyoel your MIT interviewer had no idea how right he was! You were such a delinquent back then!
@maayanroth you are the uber of break ups. Well done!
@saroy I've done this. Usually because I'm tired but sometimes because I am aisle/window dyslexic.
@maayanroth what does it say at the bottom of the email? We can discuss tonight...
I feel confident given enough time and resources I could tell smart folks what to do resulting in anything landing on anything #CometLanding
So ESA sent a washing machine 4B miles and dropped it on a 2.5mile rock travelling 40k mph. What have we done lately?
Beautiful day for outLET mall shopping. I'm gonna look like a rich person from three years ago. HT Damon Wayans
@seldo I was searching for a word like this earlier to describe Mark Zuckerberg.
The construction vehicles across the street spend more time backing up than driving forward. BEEP BEEP BEEP. Expected completion: 2017. KMN.
Just had a Snickers for the first time in years... not as good as I remembered. Why waste calories on chocolate not a Ghiradelli Square?
@_christina_ I have that same relationship with beer.
well it finally happened. I just made a doctor's appointment with a doctor who is younger than me. sigh.
@yoyoel had no idea they have not done a live show in 2 years
@maayanroth I thought we were all using gender now. Sex is so heteronormative.
@_christina_ I was big on saying the pledge. In general, I like the idea of group recitation and/or singing. We should have more of that. ;)
Things at Fright Fest I find unintentionally terrifying: strollers, running children, workers mopping the floor.
@nickam0 @yoyoel @MrManMO I was pulling for STL vs KC but SF is too lucky! I hope Ned Yost wins out... (KCmgr, Former Braves coach)
@nickam0 @yoyoel how about those Missouri teams! I've never seen @MrManMO so excited about baseball. He can name 3 players now. Maybe.
@JFSIV I'll see you @baucs wedding.
At the end of the day, I hate the weather and the diminishing sunshine, but worse I have no beer to look forward to. Don't say pumpkin!
Certainly not weather for an IPA but too soon for a Stout. Amber is not exciting but no longer a fan of Wheat or Oktoberfest varieties...
It has started. That six months of the year when my feet are cold. Sigh.
@_christina_ actually it may be that it's time for me to get reading glasses. but I'm gonna go with brain tumor.
so I've been blinking a lot today, and although WebMD indicates I don't have a brain tumor, I'm pretty sure that's what's happening.
so weird when someone randomly comments on a photo you are tagged in from six years ago.
@yoyoel @nickam0 haha. Please have him txt me with any ball park visits and I will do likewise... =)
Considering a social media cleanse in September. No Facebook no twitter no instagram... Any dissenting votes?

Me: “That seems like a good reason not to have children.”
@yoyoel ugh I revoke your bearhood. 145 is twink weight...
@yoyoel its really just an advertisement to make you jealous of Jennifer Aniston...again. (her fiance is the lead actor)
A few people stealing soda = fear and judgement in #Ferguson yet BOA is fined $17B for looting America and we're like "that's cool."
@yoyoel sounds like you have a job waiting for you at Slate.
@yoyoel I think he's only in one episode though... it's a weird show, but it's good.
I have watched far more people pour buckets of water on their heads than I ever would have imagined.
@seldo at what point do they start thinking "oh yeah, we should try to not be an asshole today, you know... considering everything".
Not for nothing but Obama has had a really crappy vacation so far.
@yoyoel you're probably right. I would have probably laughed and/or assumed the sales clerk was hitting on me.
@yoyoel  no doubt it's terrible software. even so, kind of an  unacceptable mistake. that said I have no qualms with Apple corp. culture.
@yoyoel I would assume the guy would be fine with asdf@g.com. Too coincidental unless clerk can show he always used the same for everyone.
@yoyoel are you saying the clerk typed f@g because of the UX glitch?
The trouble with boring trivia is I can't look at the internets because it looks like I'm cheating (it's a break, there's no music).
I'm at trivia with no music. It's literally only a woman shouting questions. This is the 8th circle of hell.
that awkward moment when a website adds an arbitrary password requirement that does not fit any of your existing passwords...
@saroy Same reason I drink 32oz of water faster than 6oz of margarita. Pacing...
things I didn't peg myself for but actually enjoy: 1. sitting on a yoga ball at work. 2. listening to Buika on Pandora.
@harperben @_christina_ @MrManMO I think the Braves game sounds great. Lets do it!
@yoyoel do you have a google news alert for the word "hirsuite" or something? Lol. Good Slate article. I'll work on my back hair acceptance.
@harperben haha. Let me check with the boss.
@_christina_ @harperben I think my company is going Sept 8. Monday night?
@GypsySoulVA why is bread $6? and nothing on tap. =( cc: @mosaicdistrict
Dinner @GypsySoulVA was without soul. Rushed and lacking any stand outs. Key dishes (shrimp &amp; grits, mac &amp; cheese) missed the mark.
@JFSIV Pro tip: when having positive feelings don't use quotes about death.  In fact, best to avoid Les Mis and Counting Crows altogether.
@yoyoel internet or Internet, it was a great read. you brought up things I never considered before. I could have read dozens more pages.
@jasoncollins34 I read this three times before I realized you weren't time traveling. Rather, traveling through for the first time. =)
@nickam0 holy cow, I've never been allowed to fold laundry before. that's a serious step!
@JFSIV really? The summers die one by one? Please note that as something horrible to say to someone lamenting the passing of time.
@GypsySoulVA reservations made for tonight! looking forward to a great meal in @mosaicdistrict
things I haven't done this summer: 
1. been to a baseball game.
2. been to a swimming pool. 
#timeflies #whatswrongwithme
@nickam0 how is there no @nickam0 @yoyoel reunited photo on the instagram yet??
@yoyoel @arthurnicholls honestly I really liked Bridges of Madison County. I mean, sounds so bad that it exceeds expectations. Great ending.
@nickam0 they look cute in photos but then I'm done
A QUIET, LOW-KEY WEEKEND!
WHEN DO WE WANT IT?
YESTERDAY!
simultaneously logged on to sykpe, aim, google, and yahoo for work IM.  thank goodness I consolidated my usernames years ago.
TIL: The plural of nemesis is nemeses.
@nickam0 @yoyoel I'm just so happy there's a subway guy that you've identified as your nemesis. People don't have enough nemeses these days.
Can we just all agree we are thankful for email feedback and pledge never to send an email that only says "Thanks for your feedback" again?
@nickam0 Pairs of shoes should only be constrained by size of bag. So, your friend should be fine.
@yoyoel was that tweet an elaborate explanation of why you wet your bed?
@_christina_ of course schooling someone in a board game...
@nickam0 haha. Yeah because nude neighbors blame everything on others.
@nickam0 beer should help a lot! Haha.
@nickam0 Queen fronted by Adam Lambert! We're super stoked!!
Oh good, promo hashtag... #queenalmpp you guys have lost your mind. 2 hour wait with thousands while you did nothing. Utter venue failure...
Merrifield Post Pavilion is the worst concert venue on the planet. People in lines for hours with no info. Never going here again.
"@ChipotleTweets: @ccart31 I'm glad they helped you out so quickly! -Skyllo" they are super nice on twitter too! I'm a fan.
@ChipotleTweets Me too!  You won a fan.  Fast on twitter too... Thanks Adam and Skyllo.
@nickam0 I was amused by the overrated chant, but isn't it hard to have 3,400 hits and be overrated?  Methinks so.
Burritos at @ChipotleTweets for All Star Game but they were out of cheese! Amazingly, complaint support emailed back in 15 min. Go Chipotle!
European: "I am unavailable u…
@andrewsantelli I'm guessing you leaned that in freshman chemistry at Georgia Tech... #helluvafreshmanengineer
Just found out @MrManMO picked up beer from each of the remaining countries. The battle of the #worldcup beers begins tonight!
We have two types of decaf at work, and I drink from them equally even though I like one much better. But I don't know why.

Penalty kicks are soccer's way of reminding fans it is actually possible to score, all evidence to the contrary. #WorldCup #Netherlands
That said, if you play to 0-0 in 120 minutes options::1 - keep playing soccer. 2 - OR you're both out. if you can't score you can't advance.
I've never seen Costa  Rica trying to score, and I've never seen Netherlands NOT trying. That's what's wrong with #soccer #WorldCup
costa was intentionally not defending in order to draw "off sides" calls. In baseball, if you lean into a pitch, you don't get your base.
hey @espn, recorded the match, watched DVR, downloaded your stupid app for penalty kicks, don't spoil the #worldcup result in your own app.
I've never used any drugs but I can't imagine there are any that are better than attending a Counting Crows concert.
@baucs @_christina_ well you just missed their first tour in 16 years. Honestly probably the best (non co-headliner) opener I've seen for CC
Spotted at a Counting Crows show: 2 people younger than us who aren't obviously here with their mommy.
@_christina_ yeah! They are actually great!
"I'm at a Toad the Wet Sprocket concert!" Pretend this is a 20 year old tweet and that statement is way more exciting.
@nickam0 wow I haven't seen that since 80s Braves... Chief knock-a-homa would get the wave going like that.
Feeling patriotic for the first time in a looong time because of the #worldcup. Happy 4th! 
@_christina_ oh I didn't mention I'm on the World Cup #bandwagon ? It's pop culture + shirtless athletes. How is this confusing?
I hope... "@TBoyd91: Our heroic display makes young Michael Jordans choose soccer over bball in High School now! @MLS and @ussoccer #1N1T"
Chris Wondolowski had such a beautiful opportunity in the 92nd minute. Just not enough chances. Agony. #worldcup #iwantedtobelieve

#OneNationOneTeam #USMNT #AreYouReady #WorldCup2014 #1N1T 

I believe 

I believe that 

I believe that we will win

I believe that we will win

I believe that we will win

#AreYo…
what if hobby lobby goes out of business now. if that happens can we just ignore SCOTUS?
When you find out about were-jaguars and you still keep watching the stupid show you might be watching #TeenWolf
@yoyoel I once had to send an email to everyone at GT... 17,000 emails. That was scary. Though what I do now is much bigger... :-/
@seldo Firefl-YO
@seldo Fr-YO-zen
there is no sporting achievement more rewarding than being passed by someone on the downhill only to blow by him on the uphill. #biketowork
@seldo aagh! I'm thinking of people who are all assholes! Need a block feature in "".
@yoyoel I liked TFioS but I would never have forgiven John Green if he had not written it in tribute to a girl with cancer.
"@NathanFillion: Circle your calendar, because today's the day." When your miracle gets here, you just pound this button once...
@NathanFillion please let this tweet mean that Firefly is coming back.
One of our friends literally won an Emmy for NFL sports coverage!! 
@artemis1979 yes. Lots of crying. And yes, we've been there!! Butnot because of genies. Thank goodness.
Watched "The Fault in our Stars". I thought no movie could make me cry more than "Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close." #ihateyou #JohnGreen
@yoyoel Roger: What happened to Benny what happened to his heart and the ideals he once pursued?
@yoyoel Benny: Maureen is protesting losing her performance space. Not my attitude
@yoyoel Mark: That attitude toward the homeless is exactly what Maureen is protesting tonight.
trolling on facebook is not resolving my guilt about feeling powerless about gun violence.
Blast from the past... From an old contact sheet from Technique days... 
 
Busted in on an HOA meeting trying to vote in the 8th congressional primary today. Turns out I'm in the 11th. #middle school #smellsbad
@JohnnyGrubb same could be said for cable companies... And insurance companies...
@maayanroth @yoyoel damn I didn't do that I must be old as dirt. Tomorrow I'll do that I promise. In fairness, it was Pride here today.
@_christina_ 1. Take before/after pics! 2. Just make sure A is looking spiffy for September!!
@yoyoel saw that one coming
Of note: I sent something in the mail to someone and they received it. USPS didn't fail at something! Maybe for the first time ever.
@_christina_ I think you won
@_christina_ did she finish ok??
@harperben shorty!!!
@harperben which kid? A?
@harperben are you calling me fat?
Can't decide my fav part of @mosaicdistrict farmer's market... Pinch dumplings, Rita's Crepes, or Nicecream!!
it's lotion season so I now have to deal with: 1. apply lotion 2. pick up mug of hot coffee 3. hand slips and spills coffee immediately
@yoyoel sounds like you have a lot of baggage. (groan) tell the movers "hands off my package!" (sigh). There's a zinger here somewhere...
Happiest Memorial Day!! 
I've decided the worst part about Facebook is people are so nice on Facebook. My crass sarcasm always gets me in trouble.
@saroy it's such a hopeless feeling. I've forgotten my wallet and I'm befuddled there is no way I can pay using my phone or internet...
@yoyoel congrats!  and great lecture.  you raise a bunch of good points.
Pizza party at work because no one came in due to the long weekend.  And by party I mean the four of us are going to split one pizza. lol.
@_christina_ I didn't notice a difference in traffic on my bike. ;). I made all the lights, though!
I can't believe Jack Black won American Idol.
Agile humor - Just got this user story: "As a product manager I want to remove functionality that I asked for so that I don't annoy people"
that amazing feeling you get when you realize all of the sudden you're one day away from a three day weekend!!
@yoyoel which coffee shops? That seems like a lawsuit... What about seeing eye Glass?
I'm operating on 6 hours of sleep so I want to curl up under my desk. Still I'm basically twice as effective as any parent with a toddler.
@yoyoel @nickam0 I work with call centers... I'll work on adding that to the IVR options.
@yoyoel @nickam0 if only there were an option to make phone reps commit seppuku.
The song Pompei has been stuck in my head (and worse, stuck in @MrManMO 's head) for six days.  How'm I gonna be an optimist about this?
I think the river walk at the Kennedy Center is my favorite location in DC.
Citizen's arrest! The parking guy who is ticketing five minutes before the meters are all free is double parked. Boo hiss!
@yoyoel sigh I remember back when I gave a shit about my hair. That's a luxury in itself my friend.
What does it say about me that one of my favorite responsibilities to do at work is create pivot tables in xls?
Finally had a beer with the rugby team frat house-esque neighbors to celebrate their moving out. #PBR #absencemakestheheartgrowfonder
tomorrow is "bike to work day" and it's 100% chance of heavy rain before noon.  =(  I'm thinking I'll pass but I really wanted to do it...
that moment when you need a boost so you buy yourself a Michonne samurai t-shirt on amazon...
Dark skies app: light rain for 11 minutes. Me: we can make it. 9 minutes later: oh god I'm drowning
I give up. I can no longer pretend my singing along with One Direction on Story of my Life is sarcasm.
Dark skies app: "light rain in 1 minute. "Me: smh "that seems weirdly precise" 60 seconds later: rain. Dark skies app: "girl I told you."
@_christina_ Velcro... Of course... Genius
@_christina_ what was the baby magic?
My Jawbone UP tells me "tired minds crave junk foods... avoid this sleep deprivation double whammy." I think it's calling me fat.
@artemis1979 doesn't seem promising... 
Forgot to wear my Jawbone UP today (I only take it off in the shower). I feel so naked.
@maayanroth @yoyoel forgot to mention. Margaritas: delicious. Limes: too small!! =)
@_christina_ hhahaha irony. And sorry... Hope you feel better soon.
@_christina_ I mean sorry that your eye is pink!!!
@_christina_ haha kids are so infectious
Am I doing this right? #cincodemayo 
@maayanroth @yoyoel not yet. We'll let you know.
@maayanroth @yoyoel wow that link was what I based my guess on... Getting prepped for cinco de mayo which we'll celebrate tomorrow lol.
@maayanroth @yoyoel can you tweet me your margarita recipe?
@yoyoel that's crazy. A usable file system that a user can manage on his own? Steve Jobs is rolling over in his grave.
Accidentally just drank a Barq's (caffeinated) instead of a Diet Barq's (caffeine free). I'm now dying of anxiety fueled caffeine hot flash.
this book is intense. 
@yoyoel I really hope you got that tank haha
Hey twitterverse, do I even know anyone who uses t-mobile?
Ordered something NOT from amazon and though it is free shipping I have no patience for this "4-6 business days" crap.
Church behind the scenes... Draping the cross for Sunday on Good Friday. 
had an incredibly helpful and easy conversation with the IRS. Basically they were confused about my tax forms but they fixed it in no time.
@seldo oh I was looking at comprehensive xmen franchise
@seldo oh she came out as bi. Troye Sivan was cast as young James Howlett in X-Men Origins: Wolverine.
@seldo is she bi? She's married to Stephen Moyer
@seldo who are the three gay actors in xmen? Ellen Page, Ian McKellan. Is the third one Troyes Sivan?
Because I'm a grown up and I can do what I want 
@_christina_ yeah that's my baptist good ole boy stone mountain proud to be an ah 'merican roots how did I get here wth lol
was just reminded how much I used to love the pledge to the flag. I led the pledge at both elementary school and high school graduations lol
@seldo do you ever see the name of your company and think for a second it says nph?  your tweets always make me think of @ActuallyNPH
I normally don't see the point of buying complete TV series, but Friday Night Lights for $35 on amazon? yes, please. deliver immediately!
@_christina_ love his socks
@_christina_ @MrManMO Gaya! So jealous... I need a massage lol
The movie "Noah" is going to be way better because it has been raining all day. I don't know why, just go with it.
@_christina_ wow! Color sorted buckets... That's advanced...
Pretending it's day drinking weather...
when I see someone with stone washed jeans and white tennis shoes it makes me scared one day I too will have just given up on looking good.
Today @BarackObama gave the @Pontifex a box of seeds. Now I have "A Bit of Earth" from "A Secret Garden" stuck in my head. Who's with me?
@_christina_ haha. Now he's going to want one, but later he'd regret the Lego tramp stamp...

Feeling social media drained. Content curation is not enough. I used to love blogs, flickr, and fb until the good content creators left.
That moment after I finish a Stephen King book when I pretend I want to read something besides another @StephenKing  book.
@tenorbp he's a good singer!
@_christina_ better be the last one!!
So @amazon just gave me $10 because they won in a lawsuit. Hey hey big spender. What should I spend my winnings on? =)
Me (upon getting out of bed at 12:30 and contemplating evening party plans): ugh, why must I be soooo productive on Saturdays...
All of these words make me happy 
Spring? 
fasting for 8 hours prior to a routine annual physical is my own personal "naked and afraid." I think I've lost 45 lbs today.
@harperben @_christina_ it's not just us. This is a real thing. I've read so many tweets about this fact. Lol.
@_christina_ actually iPads falling on peoples faces is kind of a thing. I have dropped my phone on my face a few times...
@ThisisBeckyW tempting but also trying to work around nephew bday so it doesn't work this time...
@_christina_ sure email me the info on jammin java dude
better get back to work. I just found out my billion dollar bracket is already busted. lol.
hey remember back when getting tickets meant lining up at a physical ticketmaster location?  wasn't there one outside of Capital Records?
adjusting my vacation plans based on the Counting Crows tour schedule... I doubt myself, but it's always worth it.
@nickam0 Maine style was lemon based mayo. Connecticut style was poached in butter. They had me at "butter". It lived up to the hype.
Finally got to try @LobstertruckDC. Was hoping for warmer weather, but enjoyed the lobster roll, Connecticut style!  Great start to Spring!
well I picked my bracket so soon I'll be a billionaire. that will be a good day.
@commahawk the natural extreme version of open kimono?
@_christina_ super annoyed at A for getting ahead of me in piano skills.
The lie I tell myself about "glad it's cold so I can wear my favorite winter outfit one more time" is now totally worn out.
Enjoying some אוזני המן for Purim #hamantaschen 
@nickam0 Wrigley is my all time favorite.
@nickam0 dammit, I've had my eye on that Detroit-Toronto-Pittsburgh-Cleveland trip for a while now. You're picking up a few I don't have.
@harperben based on your sword fighting tweet I did not know 1.who was fighting, 2.what they were wearing, or 3.what the swords would be.
@nickam0 so jealous of your ballpark roadtrip. which stadiums? I've seen 19/30.
Just got really prompt and helpful follow up from Bank of America for something annoying about their bill pay. So, points to them for that.
@_christina_ that was a weird abbreviation
@_christina_ I'm sort of jealous that you have a parasite. Built in diet!!!
@_christina_ the machines tell me that moderate five miles burns more calories, but I now run/walk with terrible endurance...
@_christina_ I am jealous of Lego days...
Taking advantage of 65 degree Saturday... Enjoying beer on the deck and reading a good book.... So happy to have warmth on my body!!
hoping to get some ideas for new gadgets I need during a wearables webinar @maas360 #WYODMaaS360
@_christina_ that is a blog I would read
@yoyoel tomorrow I'm buying your apartment complex and throwing you out. Aren't you glad I gave you the 24 hour heads up??
I have to say, I'm pretty pumped to have ordered a @jasoncollins34 Brooklyn Nets shirt today. Thanks #98!!
@_christina_ love me some flappy bird
Blessed are those with smartphones, for they can play flappy birds. This was mistakenly left out of the beatitudes.
I wonder what the crossover audience is between Downton Abbey and Walking Dead. Watching Walking, recording Downton.
@_christina_ wow I'm honored his default clothing includes something I gave him. =)
@JFSIV unsigned professionals are a lot different than amateurs... This season is only good because of Harry Conick, Jr.
@JFSIV no, they are all "unsigned". Many have lots of gigs. Adam was on Broadway. Some have had prior cds...
@_christina_ what is the outfit?
Adam Lambert broke American Idol. Everyone since then seems amateur.
I thought Jack Black was too old for American Idol. Lol.
@yoyoel I feel like you might have a future in mobile app design
I scored 29 on Flappy Bird. How awesome is that? 
Got the hockey game working on the NBC app on my awesome Windows 8 computer. Seriously love this PC.
NBC owns Hulu, right? Why not make events available there? They switched the channel for the hockey game... Now I have junk on DVR #nbcfail
@_christina_ it does seem dumb but I appreciate that they are not hetero biased... At this age at least...
@saroy being host is such a weird and wonderful talent. They should get Ryan Seacrest.
@_christina_ agreed? You sent kids with valentines for the whole class, right??
@saroy I better get something better than applesauce or someone's in trouble. =)
@saroy that's ok, my clients didn't get me anything either... ;)
@saroy the teachers don't like pouches?
My mom was without power for an hour. Forced to update facebook and email on her phone... warmed by her gas heat. What a pioneer woman. Haha
So, I got 12 do my life is complete now. 
Watching the Winter Olympics makes me realize I gave up too early on my dreams of being a ski ball champion.
@yoyoel congrats on Amsterdam!! Wish I could come!!
found some olympics... the Russian couple in the ice dancing (team event) were amazing!  but how do they have ice dancers w/ no gay people?
why the hell is NBC airing cartoons while the Olympics are on?
Annoyed there are people offended by the Coke ad from the Super Bowl. Is it so painful to reflect the existence of other cultures in the US?
@mikeheldar not always, but occasionally. Plastic is the way to go. Anyway, make a commercial when you hit 100mpg.
I think the Ford hybrid commercials were the best car commercial but I got 40mpg in my 1996 Saturn so I'm not too impressed. #plastic
Sad that the NFL commercial had more females represented than the VW engineering commercial.
At what point is it OK to switch to Downton?
@semicologne so far you are winning the Super Bowl retweet competition. I need to create a new account that follows who you follow. Lol.
I totally thought the announcer said "Cheap" halftime show. #Jeep #enunciate
OK who bet on 8-0 as the score after the first quarter?
Is it bad that I'm happy that all six invitees for our Super Bowl "party" cancelled because now I can watch the game in my pjs? #wings #beer
Kent making @_christina_ 's baby Greg cry. So cute... 
@_christina_ it appears you have a very short nanny...
@_christina_ perspective goes only so far at 3am...
@_christina_ did you do 5 miles on the elliptical yesterday?? =)
@_christina_ you can say that again...
@_christina_ you can have Sudafed? Holy cow, what else, meth?
@_christina_ haha. I did work from home Tuesday. I agree the schools were pretty lazy this week.
@_christina_ I think it's worth the trade off of weak people to have better weather. I can't imagine getting used to this... I'm fragile lol
@_christina_ time for baby!!!
@saroy shoot now amazon is suggesting other hand warming technology to me... Lol
@saroy did you try typing "heated mouse" into 
@seldo I really thought you said Mongo was shemales. That tweet did not take the turn I thought it was going to.
it was 5 degrees when I drove in this morning. I think I'm getting the frostbite, pop. 
@_christina_ no birthing tomorrow
typing a short url that has both an I and an l is insane. if you have a short URL service, consider eliminating those along with O and 0.
@_christina_ even my 4 miles were lighter. almost surreal.
@yoyoel yeah lie flat seats are terrible (who am I kidding I fly coach lolfml)
@_christina_ wow that is awesome
@kumailn my faces are ready. Bring it! #butts
The path to victory on @midnight with @kumailn is paved with #butts.
Best @kumailn quote: "I would have still slept with him. But then I'd have killed him. Because that's part of it for me."
Couldn't be more excited to be at the @kumailn show. Favorite Talking Dead guest ever.
@nickam0 I don't think he has a Grammy... does he?  His Tony and Emmy are for the same role... Angels in America.
you might be a geek if... you wake up with the "Bad Horse" (the thoroughbred of sin) in your head and it's stuck in your head all morning...
The weirdest thing about watching @nerdist on @midnight is learning what the sensors will bleep and what they leave in. lol.
Is there any common business term besides "assess" where you delete one letter and it's a swear word? Typing assess always makes me laugh.
I can tell I'm hyped up on hot chocolate based on the volume/insanity of my singing in the car...
I've been drinking A LOT of tea lately, and while I wouldn't say I love tea, it HAS made me realize that coffee is just not very good...
The fourth time you've logged into twitter might indicate you're procrastinating something. I must really not want to do this bug scrub.
@yoyoel no, I'll probably still fall for that trap another ten times... google glass here I come! but at some point... shame on me.
@yoyoel I don't care about privacy, but Nest seemed "good". usually Google treats good things badly then discontinues them.
@andrewsantelli go jelly!! Yay!
@tenorbp yes! I was looking for an article like this...
@harperben agreed. Deciding between 920 and 1020!
@harperben I mean, I don't cry with joy like the birth of my nephew but I'm often delighted by the little things.
@harperben making peoples lives better through mobile computing is basically my career so I don't think that's a flaw...
@harperben thesis confirmed. Yes you are an Apple fan boy who has sold his soul.
@yoyoel it's true, I'm in a gadget yawn. But my Nokia brought me more joy in subtle ways. mainly, it's badass at social media notifications.
To clarify for @harperben and other rational fact people I have used the 5S for 3 weeks, and it is functional but brings me very little joy.
@harperben when posting an update on which gadget brings you joy, I don't think anyone has an unbiased, rational fact point of view.
@harperben I can say this with confidence, because I've been using a 5S for two weeks, but when I go home, I use my broken screen Nokia.
I'm too cheap to buy the Nokia Lumia 1020 off contract, and too far away from the new phones and new contract. I'm in smartphone purgatory.
I broke my Windows Phone but there is nothing better to replace it. Like I literally prefer the Lumia 920 with broken screen to iPhone 5S.
@JohnnyGrubb not sure. Perhaps holidays slowed me down or perhaps I am less clever than I used to be. Happy New Year though!
@JohnnyGrubb late reply, but it's not just you. facebook has become like the pintrist of inanity...
the day always comes as a grim shock to me when I realize in a short panic that my wireless mouse battery has in fact died.
@seldo @leebutterman stage version is bright/night but the movie setting changed to gay/day
@saroy pessimism is the most realistic prediction of the future. though besides being right all the time there's no real benefit.
@_christina_ haaaay
@maayanroth @yoyoel omg how awesome would it be if Peggy dates Dule Hill (Charlie) on mad men??
@maayanroth @yoyoel ooh. I love Peggy. makes me want to binge watch west wing real bad...
@yoyoel omg I just figured that out a few weeks ago
@_christina_ very cool!!
@_christina_ ooh. Living large. Tell me how it is.
@maayanroth I eliminated "guys" from my vocabulary for that very reason... I realized I never call a mixed group "gals" so it's not fair.
@_christina_ glad you are feeling better
@_christina_ yay!! What are you seeing??
@kumailn boom. tickets reserved. see you soon!
@_christina_ oh no! so sorry you're sick. poor baby along for the ride... get better soon.
points to @MrManMO 's mom for giving me Dr. Who "TARDIS" socks. But the Weeping Angel socks were too scary so I traded them to @MrManMO.
@tenorbp not sure if I have your number. We have dinner plans - can u do lunch tomorrow ?
ready to head out to the mall to by myself all the things I didn't get but really wanted. actually only one thing: a new winter hat. lol.
@tenorbp haha. We are here. Come by! Call or txt!
The cattle are lowing the baby awakes but little John Carter no crying he makes... 
When the family arrived at 6 for the 5pm Christmas Eve service my sister proclaimed "happy birthday stupid baby Jesus one hour late." Lol.
@DevonRogers33 haha. Sounds like fun.
Love love love Christmas Eve Eve. It's like Christmas with none of the requirements. Possibly my favorite holiday!
@yoyoel amazing stocking. I all curious about the other ones now. Love the phone icon. =)
Me: You gave the dog an Ewok? Mom: Yeah. Me: Those are collectors items. Mom: That one isn't.
Inbox zero. Peace out. See you next year.
Debating about who to unfriend on facebook for showing support for Duck. It's really sad to see old conservatives holding him up as a hero.
I've totally lost track of how many cookies I've eaten today. Help. #dietstartsin2014
someone put a huge box of cookies in the break room. like over 200 small Mrs. Fields cookies. this is dangerous. #dietstartsin2014
@saroy what's a post office. If it doesn't ship from amazon or shutterfly...
@seldo I think being gay or being an immigrant gives you an automatic opt out so you're doubly covered.
@yoyoel spoiler: work never ends. grad school is not an exception.
Google motto 2010: Evil is tricky to define
Google motto 2013: We make military robots
On Saturday I love to play the game"stay in bed as long as possible"
every time someone says Smaug like "sm-'ow'-g" instead of "smog" an angel gets it's wings clipped.
Singing spirituals in my car about the sorrow of Christmas mall traffic. #firstworldproblems.
@harperben full confidence in the kids ability, no confidence in the musical competence of the adults letting them to scream like that.
@harperben screaming, daily, the kids were terrible. what kind of adult let's children scream "halelujah" with no regard to pitch or rhythm.
enjoyed some hot cocoa and I so rarely drink caffeine that it has me buzzing. can't focus!  so many thoughts!
complained to the building mgr today about the children rehearsing their Christmas music... as cuddly as a cactus, and as charming as an eel
@seldo @yoyoel secular Christmas music (eg: Frosty, Rudolf) is horrible. sacred Christmas music (eg: Handel's Messiah) is a treasure trove.
@seldo @yoyoel most of "Christmas" is pagan in origin - the date being Dec 25 (feast of the son of Isis), gift giving, trees, even caroling.
I love some creative advertising!!  Go WestJet!  
@_christina_ love the planet money bump!!
@yoyoel the waiter did what to you??
@_christina_ so many questions. so much wanting of fondue.
Can we cancel work today? it's too beautiful outside!
Abby, Laurel and Brindabella. Wait, Brindabella? Were they not expecting the third triplet?
being sick is horrible. but once you're well again, it's so wonderful to not be sick anymore. #onestomachfluawayfrommygoalweight
@harperben yes well it should have thought of that before it left the K off in the first place. what's wrong with panick?
@harperben POINTS!
the daycare outside is having the children scream holiday words in what they call "practice". makes me both hate holiday music and children.
I never understood why panic adds a "k" in past tense. Are there any other words that do that? Related: panicked about work deadlines.
just about any time I order pasta or crave pasta, I wish it were spinach tortellini with alfredo sauce from eats.@tweetedeats
trying new smartwool socks today. I'm sorry, my feet are still cold. this is why I have an electric throw blanket for the living room. #old
Great video, glad UK Olympian @TomDaley1994 is happy.  #Rio2016 
My cable is inexplicably out. Firefly bluray: play all.
@saroy sounds like you've been kissing too many people.
When the day starts at 22 degrees, 35 actually feels nice.
Big red button #DoctorWho50th
So excited!! What is happening!?! #DoctorWho50th
I love mosaicdistrict 
@_christina_ I can't decipher when people spell things out loud. I also would never be able to spell backwards. A is smarter than me.
Realized my bagel at breakfast is really stale. Still chowing down. #carboholic
Other super powers include sitting still, analyzing data, and not feeling awkward even when other people in the room are feeling awkward.
Realized another super power I have... I'm never bored. Add it to the list!
@_christina_ your dog is not wooing me. Haha.
@yoyoel what? no beard?  given the other things in your office, I'm thinking this mug is fine. lol.
ah, Smaug 
@yoyoel awesome!
@_christina_ your twitter is still spamming me I think
@yoyoel is your man running a marathon?
@_christina_ was your twitter hacked?
Feeling very energetic today. It's distracting. Feels like I accidentally drank caffeine or something...
@Braves I'm unfollowing you on twitter because of the move. As a fan, I feel betrayed, and I think the move is offensive in many ways.
@_christina_ first world problems...
this is why I hate google. because I implicitly trust them and they keep pulling the football out like lucy in peanuts.
@saroy then I can only assume they don't know what's going on and they are writing just to seem busy.
@saroy I take notes by hand for anything that's ephemeral. Like interviewing job candidates.
I think the guy who used the urinal before me might be radioactive. Pee is not supposed to be that color.
My internal thermostat hates cold. The break room is warm, so sitting in here - head = hot. hands = good. feet = cold. Cold feet = I'm cold.
.@MrManMO just dropped a stitch while making my socks.
Huh? Needs MARTA... RT @Braves: We are excited to announce plans to build a world-class stadium, which will open in 2017
@ThisisBeckyW I'm requesting socks... Lol
OK so now Kent is a beginning knitter. Lol.
At a knitting store called fibre space. One of the designs us called "she's a waterfall". What is happening to my life.
Idina Menzel in If/Then in it's pre-Broadway run... AH mazing.
Success with 2 minutes to spare. 
@_christina_ wow! Thanksgiving!!
We now have 14 minutes to get a drink some place it doesn't have free corn hole...
@artemis1979 ooh. Good idea I think I'll get a starbucks for breakfast
@JFSIV ah yes, the city with no seasons. Actually having seasons has grown on me...
@_christina_ well its warming up now. Does that mean I have to face the day? =)
When you realize it's &lt; 32 outside so you just stay bundled in bed as long as possible on a Saturday...
@_christina_ you have two short people, two four legged dependants, and a parasite. Pretty sure you don't get free time...
@saroy @_christina_ I'm using news blur and the last one I see is Oct. 3. Weird.
@saroy I no longer see your blog on my RSS reader. Did the feed break or is it just me? @_christina_ do you see it?
@yoel mapped history of the word "bear" 
so many memories... RT@qz Map of Blockbuster holdouts reveals one city with more stores than 40 states combined 
my Dove candy wrapper just let me know that Chocolate won't let me down. That is true, and makes me feel better about life.
@_christina_ wow I didn't know that was a thing. pregnancy is hard.
can anyone give me compelling reasons why I should or should not spend $1500 to be part of Google Glass?
@_christina_ wow. Fine dining! You should say hi!
@yoyoel my slogan for Philly in general is "Philadelphia: what's that smell?"
facebook asked me to "like" the Kirk Cameron page because I have 6 friends that like it. time to unfriend some people.
@yoyoel that dinner price better include a flight somewhere...
@_christina_ ooh, that's quite a nice plant!
in email I always write "hi team", but still struggle saying "guys" for any group. just said "bye guys" to a mixed gender team. =( #sexism
surprising lack of social networks emotion from all those complaining that they have not been working for 2 weeks. are we happy now?
just recommended that someone have a rap session with a coworker. think I'm officially an 80 year old man. #whosaysthat
Nephew. Haircut. Adorable. 
I'm doing both. Because you can't win without me and neither can they. #pilotepisode #RememberingCory
If you can't fold a fitted sheet, you can't work at sheets n' things. #pilotepisode #RememberingCory
Bawling my eyes out. As expected. #RememberingCory
This show is so scary. RT @currageous: American Horror Story: Congress
today I remembered my goggles. that made swimming at least 3x as fun. favorite side benefit of swimming in chlorine: instantly clear skin.
committed myself to doing my swim workout before work today. crying all day after forgetting my goggles.  #fail #toomuchchlorine
Just got walked into a sold out concert by the band when the line went around the block. Rules don't apply to me I do what I want. #VIP
@_christina_ super dad!!
Life at @_christina_ household 
@harperben if there is not both decorative gourds and beer at your house I will be sorely disappointed.
@harperben well the photo is obviously Oktoberfest and it is undeniably decorative gourd season. What's the disconnect?
Oktoberfest must mean it is decorative gourd season. 
@ThisisBeckyW it is small though I am a baby about it
@tenorbp wow you really are a real dad.  how did that happen!
so the maintenance lady who cleans our bathrooms always knocks but I've realized I don't care if she just does her thing. #alliemcbeal
so it's finally time for you to know... I've had a splinter in my finger for over a week. so, there's that.
I don't care if @SpeakerBoehner keeps his job. just keep repeating those 2 points until we have a government. I'm over it. #houseofturds
2. In the absence of @SpeakerBoehner being sane, 17 republicans can bring a clean CR to the floor. There are not 17 sane republicans. #rant
I yelled at NPR a lot this morning. There are only two salient points. 1. @SpeakerBoehner refuses to raise a clean CR...
haha. Stephen King is awesome. 
@artemis1979 @saroy all I know is we are enjoying it for now. More than a week would make us grumpy.
@saroy you are really looking at all the down sides of funemployment. I never get random stacations with no chance if layoff.
The real tragedy of the government shut down is I can't see "Gravity" at the Air and Space museum IMAX.
I really want to start an organization whose sole purpose is to punish the House of Representatives. #HouseOfTurds
imagine your only job is to make a budget. it doesn't have to balance. just need a piece of paper saying money can be spent. still you fail.
I tried to send a fax earlier today. Then I lol-ed and took a picture of the document with my phone instead. What is a fax? lol.
while no one was watching, TB won the one game playoff which allows them to advance to the one game wild card. what is even happening.
@harperben quiet you.
@harperben oh shoosh.
@harperben the older I get the less I care about things I don't care about...
@harperben I have no idea what you are talking about.
I am being oppressed. People keep asking me questions about football.
@andrewsantelli I almost replied that it hasn't been 20 years since Andy Van Slyke... But then I remembered I am OLD.
@andrewsantelli that's.500. you're celebrating .500.
OH: Don't poke the pregnant lady in the belly!
@_christina_ I am not! I just got oppressed by addidas because their rainbow socks only come in girl sizes.
@_christina_ girl babies do not wear jeans. Lol.
@_christina_ the next one wears jeans?? Does that mean boy??!!??
Can't believe I just saw this... RT @FabioMRagona: @KofC epic #selfie #PopeFrancis 
this is true. 
hey, remember when that Ford commercial guy won American Idol?  that was awesome.
I feel really bad when someone's obviously working their outfit and it's not working. Then I wonder how often I do that.
When the plan is I'll take a nap while you go for a jog, guilt surely follows.
@_christina_ wow your note pad scribbling is waaaay smarter looking than mine.
@_christina_ not in the evenings...
yesterday a bug flew in my eye while biking. it still hurts. now I plan to wear clear glasses while biking as if I didn't look dorky enough.
Yes, it is intermission. Intermission!!
Watching the lord of the rings: fellowship of the ring with live orchestra and chorus! Amazing! 
Well it finally happened. Welcome to Microsoft Nokia friends.
OH: "then you're gonna love this wedding. beautiful invitations, honey baked ham."
@_christina_ Justin Timberlake used to be a mouseketeer, so its really no surprise
hey twitter people, what is your preferred offline mobile video content process? (especially for phone... and especially OS agnostic).
@ThisisBeckyW I think the posters are cool!! Made me want to learn how! =)
I find the key to grilling is knowing the right time to flip 'em. The right time = one beer + not really caring how they turn out.
When you misspell Physics in a snarky reply, you lose the high ground forever.
@yoyoel the operative data point is... what class are the students sitting in. I'm guessing, not Phisics?
@harperben for example - how level headed and reasonable you are being. so oppressive. what, are you saying I'm unreasonable??? #oppressed
@yoyoel Christmas music is a broad genre. Most Christmas music that you probably hate is probably not even Christmas music (eg: Frosty)
@harperben stop oppressing me by pointing out that I'm not being oppressed.
@JoshDaws I don't know when penny pinching became socially unacceptable. Seems like it used to be one of my better qualities.
I'm feeling oppressed because I'm really cheap. I like eating free pizza, and I like sitting in the upper deck. can I just be cheap please?
My dad has the cutest facebook status today. &lt;3 40 year anniversary. Amazing. 
@_christina_ wow! If Aiden takes lessons I will have to start lessons to keep up!
so I went on a 12 mile bike ride yesterday but today I did not wake up with the body of Lance Armstrong. so I guess it's time for steroids.
Birthday action shot 
Miss Saigon for Kent's birthday! Terrific! 
@_christina_ bad traffic but just passing through. Birthday boy dinner and a show tonight in Shirlington.
Passing Iwo Jima in traffic. Amazing. 
@_christina_ my run yesterday was divine...
my normal email inbox count is around 12, but today I can't get it below 27. #stopsendingmeemail #please
listening to the "Adele" channel on Pandora can really wreck your emotions during a work day. lol.
@seldo it is a good bet Snowden has other  intel in his head or on hard drives that we don't want shopped around in exchange for "asylum"
just took a sudafed so now my heart is going to explode.
I need a new style of work week. If I've been swamped and stressed for 2.5 days, that should be the weekend.
Eating spoons full of honey is wonderful for sore throats. Only downside is having a sore throat... =(
Only in DC do you take 95 South in order to go Northwest on 495.
Babysitting with @MrManMO !! 
Wiener heading west 
@_christina_ yeah I was counting @MrManMO as one of the women. So many opinions!!
being on an email thread with eight women who all have opinions... best not to reply to anything, I'll just do as I'm told.
@commahawk does it weird you out to sit at such an open desk? we move to an open design office next week...
I know I don't have screaming babies and I get awesome sleep but I'm playing the "I'm sleepy" card, skipping my run, and ordering take out.
@ThisisBeckyW Actually neither. =) We both have August birthdays, so it was just dinner with friends and birthdays observed. =)
Birthday, observed. Very happy cupcakes. 
Shopping in style. 
used the internet to find out what to do with outdated business cards. conclusion: throw them away. #internetfail
hey @_christina_ and @harperben you guys might need this.  
I had the worst dreams last night. I dreamed I saw Cory Monteith at a party. He had recovered. =(
Not to kick a man when he's down, but I just turned my old PC sideways to use as a foot rest.
Wow. Way to go @harperben. Feeding you family of nine. =)
Ate lasagna made by @_christina_ tonight. So full. So delicious. Gained five pounds.
@yoyoel yeah @MrManMO is the cage free advocate at our house... He was happy to see your tweet.
Some says you want a Starbucks even when it is clear the barista is not having a good day. #firstworldproblems
@seldo yeah I'm blaming you for getting REM stuck in my head all morning. me: wailing "everybody twerks" out of tune in the shower.
As he left the movie theater the 2 year old wept because his sippy cup was empty. I laughed but was surprised when he threw the cup at me!
@_christina_ @MrManMO so tempting...
@_christina_ oh and the dreaded passive aggressive turning off of the idleness indicator. The drama...
@saroy 5... Prioritize. It turns out you don't have to reply to everything...
@saroy 1. Read and file email on phone. 2. File or action immediately when possible. 3. Delegate. 4. Make a list. 5. If all else fails...
@yoyoel never thought of that before but now i will never not think of that. Good cis/trans explanation.
@tenorbp wow, I am jealous. Love those things.
At American History Museum... Way too many parents having to explain to their kids how a record player relates to their iPod.
Watching "the break up" episode of Glee and weeping. #heartbreaking I'm gonna miss you Cory Monteith.
kind of funny - put a guy's picture on the cover of the NYT = terrorist. but put the same picture on the Rolling Stones cover = "rock star".
Enlightenment: 
@ThisisBeckyW fine but I would like to be over reactionary today. Lol.
@ThisisBeckyW apparently the South is only loving if you are a white Christian hetero cisgendered male
Zimmerman was an asshole. Wondering how many new assholes FL just created. So glad I moved out of the South.
@tenorbp I am in ATL too! Any chance you'll be at DUMC tomorrow?
in which you give up on ironing the shirt you were going to wear and soak it in water to throw it in the dryer instead.
@saroy Netfix by far. Though I use Amazon to rent. DVR is better than Hulu...
@saroy Windows Surface. =)
@JohnnyGrubb I really want to code an app. But despite my CS degree, have not written code in, oh, twelve years. Sticking to PM for now...
@JohnnyGrubb so why didn't you get into mobile phone code?
Man w/ white beard just warned kid next to me at Moe's to eat his food and clean his room. Apparently, Santa. #watching
@seldo precisely why I don't write code...
@_christina_ @saroy did you pee on a pregnancy test? Submit your Masters project? Set in motion an evil plan to take over the world??
@seldo I assume that means "we hit someone, but we can't assign blame yet, so we'll leave it open ended and maybe the media won't bother us"
@seldo did I read correctly that 50% of the fatalities from the plane crash were caused by a car accident?  
It seems notable that USA Today is now small enough to slide under my hotel room door. Also notable that makes it slightly more appealing.
@andrewsantelli @saroy burninating the village!
How can you walk into Williams Sonoma when Living on a Prayer is playing and not break out in a personal dance party?
it's really confusing to have two long, separate email conversations with different members of your family who have the same name.
@ThisisBeckyW I saw that! Looks like that place is run by hippies which does not surprise me. Hopefully it irons out!
Had so much fun hanging out with Becky this weekend! Gonna miss her. Brunch at Tabard Inn #delicious 
"I want a ride to money." -a five year old in response to his brother receiving cash for his birthday.
@seldo @yoyoel haha. That was not what I expected when I googled that. Lol.
The problem with wearing clothes that fit is that they get really rude about alerting you that you've added an inch or two to your waist.
@_christina_ um, are fun people invited to said party?
Things that happen. 
@yoyoel take some photos when you're out with @mrmanmo tonight.
@350 @yayblynn how is running gasoline across the country in tankers a more efficient use of carbon emissions than the pipeline?
@tenorbp agreed, but it is more fun to intentionally ignore it. Lol.
I would have much preferred to intentionally not watch the big hockey game instead of accidentally not watching it. #NHL #isthatasport
I feel like twitter owes me an apology. None of you told me the NHL Finals was last night. Also missed the tightrope walker. #onlynewssource
@_christina_ masks made at camp? Love the color. =)
My niece just said CarCar meaning me for the first time followed soon after by GrandMa for the first time. Once again I win in baby talk.
Alexandria food and wine festival won't let anymore people into the "wine" area. #alexandriafoodandwine #sucks
@_christina_ stupid door installer people who have not finished after three weeks
just realized another of my super powers is writing strongly worded emails.
@seldo re: ender - isn't that true of all Mormons? I think I can see the movie and still defeat his hateful sad insignificant religion.
@saroy yeah tetanus shots are no joke.
@_christina_ @baucs good point... I need to add more to my car fund!!
@artemis1979 @_christina_ @baucs need a gas tank for road trips imho. also @justinbieber has a Tesla so it must be lame.
@_christina_ @baucs I was considering the Volt. From what I understand, it uses 30 miles per day before any gas is needed. That is perfect.
@baucs @_christina_ thank goodness you did not mean ford focus. but why would you suggest Lexus instead of Nissan?
@_christina_ yay! New car!
@saroy haha, true. We where the same shoe size, does that count? Still, NM last call is a good suggestion...
@saroy niemen marcus last call. why was that tweet only for the ladieez?
@yoyoel It will dry you out and increase your heart rate. Drink water and don't have a heart attack.
Watching a panel on second screen applications, meanwhile half of the audience is on facebook and twitter. #cable13
a guy I know looks like a famous comedian but I can't remember which... they all look the same when I google image search "famous comedians"
When Round Here comes on Pandora I realize that is still, after 20 years, my all-time favorite rock song.
apparently 4 is the number of cups of decaf I can drink before I start buzzing on caffeine. too many morning meetings. #heart #palpitations
@yoyoel I am allergic to pesto
it has been once again confirmed that my superpower is analyzing data in xls.
@yoyoel I think it's a better indication of what a pain in the a$$ it is to migrate off of iTunes. It should not be that hard.
@NokiaUS Hey, Nokia twitter guy, Everyone is going to unfollow you if you keep posting about this contest. Try replying to users instead.
OK #dontstopbelieving is even harder to dance to. #Isurvived
Danced to four songs at wedding. Totally exhausted, ready for bed. #footloose #isreallyhardtodanceto
A nice editorial on being lucky. 
@JohnnyGrubb wine at 9am?
@seldo I use trillian for work. So, native I guess.
@commahawk ok, DM me your email or phone #.
@commahawk hey we have extra comedy tix to see Chris Hardwick on Saturday. are you interested?
I had lunch with the Indian Ambassador to the US today. She was cool.
I'm old. It's been raining all week and the whole time I have been thinking "wow, this will be so good for my new grass seed." #getoffmylawn
why is "meantime" one word but "time frame" is two words??? argh!!
just watched this week's madmen. had to watch each scene multiple times. amazing. such a good show.
@harperben not the harper I expected when I clicked on that picture.
After 90 days of doing pushups and situps every day, I think I am going to take today off.
For anyone who was worried, I found my left shoe.
Today I went to put on my brown work shoes, and I could only find one. How do I lose only my left shoe?? The other neatly on the shelf...
Waking up from a nap and starting your "morning routine" at 6pm and other signs you had a relaxing Sunday.
yesterday I completed 12 weeks of chin ups, push ups, and situps every day. I can now do 2 sets of 10 chin ups, 25 push ups, and 25 situps.
@JFSIV shh. You are tweeting too loud. Go back too sleep.
Note to the guy next to me whose date is drunk, on facebook, and complaining about other girls: get the check, you're not getting any.
Mexican food: because sometimes you want to call a margarita and a bowl of cheese "dinner".
@_christina_ it is not "mental health" when you are actually sick. =) Feel better.
@seldo @yoyoel sad thing was, I did not even doubt the legitimacy of said paper.
That's 54 days to make one door.  They are incompetent and will  lie to you. Use anyone except Home Depot. I recommend Lowe's. #noservice
When I realized they made the door incorrectly and escalated a  "rush" to the corporate office, the best they can offer is 3 MORE weeks.
Looking to order a custom door for your house? Use anyone except Home Depot. They took over a month to deliver, then made the door wrong.
@_christina_ you can't share his drugs... You should get a test too... They can do a strep test at CVS.
I literally forgot Bill and Hillary were married until that photo today.
I only know one character's name, and I am pretty sure he is dead. Ned Stark is dead right?
I caught up on 2 weeks of GOT last night but I can't keep the characters straight which make "oh no, that old guy died!" so anticlimactic.
Only in America would we shoot a guy a bunch of times, nurse him back to health, and then charge him with capital crimes.
@harperben That seems inconsistent to me... Send him to TX I guess? Also, we already shot him a bunch, so seems overzealous too.
Can someone please explain to me how he is eligible for the death penalty in a state that specifically prohibits the death penalty?
When you think about it, every day really is earth day. #deepthoughts #EarthDay
@_christina_ you can move in with us. We have wireless chargers and NFC speakers. Don't let the bad man keep you down. =)
@harperben ok scary apple man. =)
@harperben that will be true for the rest of your life unless you start to leave somewhere...
@_christina_ Samsung Galaxy S4 is also available for preorder...
@_christina_ Nokia Lumia 920 of course...
Once I saw an overweight coworker enter the throne room with several donuts in hand. People ate just terrible. #mmmdonuts
#seenworse (2/2)
I find talking on the phone in the bathroom revolting, but not as bad as the guy in the can right now who is eating a bag of chips. (1/2)
@_christina_ "not gonna roll my eyes if the trains aren't runnin'..." listen to Harper Blynn, read a book, relax... =)
I made someone laugh today hard enough that his gall bladder hurt. I consider this a lifetime achievement.
@asabfb omg your Leroy street post just raised your cool points by 1000. Lol. Nice!
@_christina_ @rachel_f @jenny_c_ yay! Boy? Girl? Name?
I assume there will also be singing. 
@_christina_ adding these to my schedule. Not sure which is better, have to ask the boss.
@NokiaUS please stop hyping @MLB on WP until we get MLB AtBat. I am literally carrying two phones so I can use that app!!
@_christina_ I want to come cheer at a tball game!
Amazing! @matchbox opened early @mosaicdistrict and I pigged out! So happy. So full. 
@tenorbp keep me posted. Live baseball? Any time my friend.
@tenorbp wow. so many feelings. Btw, when are you coming to DC??
@tenorbp disagree. That was a great game and I have never seen that much hustle in the @NBA
I can't believe they haven't started this game yet. What kind of stupid championship game starts this late? It's Monday. It's bedtime.
@harperben @_christina_ wow, I wish Pete got this much radio time!!!
@_christina_ @harperben Ben is your dad on the Dianne Rheme show today?
@_christina_ deal.
what is this book even about? 
this... is true. 
@harperben I'd suggest beer to avoid going into a coma.
Easter drinking game: take a shot any time Alleluia is said or sung.
reading a morbid but light hearted book. 
As I review the March Madness brackets, it occurs to me that the older I get the less I care about things I don't care about.
Play time with Uncle @MrManMO 
@seldo Fair. But still better than every other current Republican.
@seldo hmm.better to continue to discriminate?
Nan pizza is my new favorite go to quick pizza fix. 
on the day of Google Reader's death, thinking fondly of when my friends updated blogs daily and I would just check them one at a time. #1998
so, is the @NewsBlur website normally this slow, or only when Google announces that they are your only hope for RSS readers now?
@harperben yeah, not catholic would have made me really happy.
Excited about pope from Argentinia but not excited about a 76 year old anti-gay anti-contraception head priest. Not sure what I expected...
not a fan of the name Pope Francis I.  but I can't pronounce Cardinal Bergoglio, so...
my money was on Brazil. congrats Argentina for the papal upset!
I am irrationally excited about the fact that a new pope exists.
sad mornings when I am too busy to get my second cup of decaf coffee. related, I am totally addicted to decaf coffee how is that possible?
@saroy I saw that coming. Daycare germs take no prisoners...
@_christina_ yay Harper shirts!
Realized as I was rocking out to Les Mis today that I have been rocking out to Les Mis for 20 years. Seems pathological at this point.
Cooking with @MrManMO 2007?? 
#2InstaWithLove 
@_christina_ isn't there some kind of minimum time for gaming? 6am Catan is like beer with pancakes.
@_christina_ I wish I was ever as excited about anything as your kids are about candy, cookies, and legos.
Internet not working is the workplace equivalent of the zombie apocalypse
@_christina_ I am glad you added "in sports" to that statement. Lol.
also how is congress acting like the sequester is something that is happening to them instead of something they are doing?  you did this!
in light of unemployment, home value decline, and household cutbacks, how is a 2.8% budget cut the end of the world?
Worse: "Men of borderline fitness can do 10 pull-ups, while those in poor  health which the council advises "needs work" can do 5 or less."
My 5 pull ups this morning seemed good till I read "Healthy men should be able to do 15 pull-ups" (President's Council on Physical Fitness)
Homemade alfajores from @dolcezzagelato ... Dangerous for my diet!! @mosaicdistrict 
@JFSIV the consequence of phone laws is: you won't unlock your phone (which you have no interest in doing). Marriage inequality us worse.
@JFSIV why don't you start some campaigns for marriage liberty instead of focusing on unlocking your iPhone?
Was just recounting the story of giving my mom a cactus in second grade at which point I realized that plant is TWENTY SEVEN years old.
The worst thing about Android is the stupid apps don't work on all devices. #androidfail #nexus7 I want #mlbatbat and #amazonprime videos.
Shamelessly wishing I had a new NFC speaker with wireless charging #NokiaPoweredMeUp
Pretending to be snowed in. Pasta, Apple Cider, movie night.
@_christina_ I would petition to remove any state in the union that shows "WalMart" as the top missed connection.
@_christina_ get home safe!
@_christina_ you are having a busy week!!
@_christina_ sounds like a party!
@yoyoel I hear many companies are in need of experts not afraid to jab their thumbs in people's eyes even when not strictly necessary.
Although I have various fitness goals, it makes me happy to be healthy enough to jog five miles for fun with no particular goal in mind.
OH: "TBD:  Find place to see whirling dervishes" (last item in email from@artemis1979 re: travel plans) lol.
Ella showing @MrManMO and I her new trick of standing on her own!! =) 
Is your theater playing Clue? :-) 
Pretending to be young and going to a late dinner and midnight movie. Time for a disco nap.
@JSFIV please don't retweet newt gingrich. It makes me think you care what he says and that makes me sad.
@r_stubberfield hooray USA! Fans still awake here!
@yoyoel we have been to Starbucks together. :) But I can see that tap and go fake money might be easier than credit card.
@yoyoel don't you use Starbucks money on your iPhone?
@JFSIV I mean one that works well...
All I want is a FB mobile app that works. Is that too much to ask? I blame Zuck.
Just realized that over the years I have granted twitter access to 34 different applications on at least 6 mobile OSes. Wow. #revoke
@JFSIV have you earned enough good husband points to come visit yet??
@_christina_ no more"action shots"... Omg you tweet the worst pictures of me ever.
@_christina_ we'll see...
Day 4 of salad lunches, and I am amazed at how filling and delicious they are. Weight loss = 0. Lol.
Weird, the Seinfeld playing on the CW right now is the one where my cousin is the guest star.
Yesterday, sleeting. Today 65 degrees. So warm I forgot my coat as I was  leaving the barber shop.
@JFSIV opine away, but I won't consider your thoughts on winter weather very expert.
@tenorbp nope, watching my carbs. Might do 1 beer a week.
Just now had my leg fall asleep from hip down and yet I walked it off with no needles. Bizzarre.
@JFSIV no comments from southerners enjoying a balmy 70 degrees!
Day 1 of the diet in which I substitute a salad for lunch.
@_christina_ it was mostly rain tbh, yet @MrManMO got to sleep in till 8:30!
I should mention - I saw Les Mis again last night. It is only the third movie I have seen three times in the theater!
first snow of my living in DC!
@_christina_ I did not know the snow protocols. So strange living somewhere that can actually treat icy roads and plow snow.
@_christina_ are you working from home?
Same cake after one year old smashed it 
Can't believe Ella is one!!! 
@_christina_ what are you seeing? Did you go to Angelica?
seems my health or vanity would be driving factors for losing weight, but really I'm cheap and don't want to buy new clothes. #diet2013 #fat
Who do you think will win at the #Oscars?  Make your picks with the My Picks official Oscar ballot. 
 
Ug.I haven't tweeted because I'm using iPhone 4 while my Nokia Lumia 920 is under repair (faulty proximity sensor). Sad. Need my phone back!
@saroy you know photoshop v2 is free now?
I feel reasonably certain that I would have a pretty good 10k time if the second half of Adele 21 were as good as the first half.
I have been awake for an hour but don't want to get out of bed... #Monday
@_christina_ ah, I forgot that local sports ball game was on today. Lol. we were busy with Downton... ;)
"don't be defeatist dear, it's very middle class." #downtonsmacktalk
"I don't want any money. You can hardly lock me up until I die." #downtonsmacktalk
"don't listen. she's pretending to be reasonable." #downtonsmacktalk
"can you hear the words coming out of your mouth? can you hear how stupid and selfish they sound? because I can." -Downton Smack Talk
@AndyStanley @NathanJager omg that person can highlight every line perfectly straight! I have no such talent!
I know I should be rewatching Downton today, but instead I'm catching up on @ActuallyNPH in "Puppet Dreams." 
@yoyoel put a bird on it.
More sad about the end of the cheese straws than I was about taking down the tree today... 
My team just won the company scavenger hunt and we got this sweet trophy. 
@JFSIV you should be pretty used to the words "Carter is right..." by now...
@_christina_ did you become 80 years old? Now the wind is a big factor for you?
Chocolate croissant. Worth it. 
Chocolate croissant. Worth it. 
Stopped traffic is never fun on a long drive, but it couldn't be more beautiful. 
@Keenan_Rogers sounds fun. I'll set something up next time I am in town.
@saroy but it was selfish babysitting... Picked him up early from daycare just to hang out with him. :)
@Keenan_Rogers I was at DUMC Sunday. Spending time w/ my nephew today!
Had to change a diaper, so I guess that is checked off the old bucket list.
Enjoying nephew time but finding it weird to be solo babysitter, even though it is just for an hour...
@Keenan_Rogers no ribbons, no bows, everything is square and must stack. Do you have rules to make it work that way?
A very Braves Christmas! 
Ready to tear into some presents!! 
@_christina_ oh good. Don't want to break my streak of never having shoveled snow. ;-)
@_christina_ how much snow? photo?
NPR online streaming isn't working! And I don't have BBC so we are listening to a fuzzy radio broadcast of King's College #technologyfail
And... asleep. (literally ten seconds later) 
Getting sleepy... 
You know you are in georgia when you see the dixie flag fly. #redstate #embarassing
Some Hickory hospitality en route home. 
Some Hickory hospitality en route home. 
Can't wait to see my nephew tomorrow. Happy happy.
Wondering how many people, like me, thought it would be a good idea to rent 2012 on amazon tonight. #apocalypse
@_christina_ oh, weird. I thought everyone was on cloud Exchange now...
@_christina_ don't you have work email on your phone?
Just asked a coworker in India to send me a text if he notices the world ending there. Or did the Mayans not know about time zones?
Actually running CHKDSK for the first time in about ten years after a lovely blue screen. #coffee
@tenorbp umm... I would consider that. Who's in?
@JFSIV I felt the same way about pepperoni pizza... And caffeinated coffee... =(
I guess I should have known this but apparently peanut butter is really bad for heartburn. PBJ, you were a good friend. Miss u already. =(
Such an awesome day today. Blue sunny skies and 60 degrees. 
Haha. Remember back when Instagram was cool? Way to waste $1B Zuck. Lol.
@JFSIV oh. I feel no allegiance to the Falcons, but I have also never seen an NFL game.
@JFSIV when did you become a falcons fan?
@tenorbp but the question is red drawers or commando?
@_christina_ yum!!!
@JFSIV you should watch it immediately.
Actually nothing makes sense today. I just have to remind myself that everyone, even the NRA, feels bad today and wants to hug their kids.
@internalfusion cause it makes it seem like gun advocates don't care about kids. not saying that's the case, just asking to let others vent.
When there is a Constitutional amendment proposed to overturn the 2nd, by all means tell me your opinion on twitter. But today, please shh.
@internalfusion right, it is OK to hear those things while people are emotionally hurting. People need a way to feel they can avoid tragedy.
Actually really excited about 3D IMAX + 48 FPS #HFR #geek 
Good thing @MrManMO made us get here 90 mins early for the Sat matinee of The Hobbit. #Bilbo #noline 
@internalfusion buddy... No one is gonna take your guns. Just let the issue lie while the nation grieves and deals with the insanity...
There are kindergarteners in my building about to perform a pageant. In case there was any doubt, they are terrible.
I suppose I should have some sort of digital checklist, but nothing keeps me organized like a pad of paper.
Spilled coffee all over my weekly checklist and it was especially satisfying to transcribe the checked off boxes to a clean sheet.
I find the pope to be offensive but I still follow him on twitter. But only in German. Platitudes sound so much cooler in German.
@yoyoel agreed. It is apple's job to make a map. It is still your job to get where you are going.
Can't decide if the grey hair in my beard stubble says "sexy and sophisticated" or "old and busted." Let's go with the former.
Wish we could have friends visit every weekend! 

Saturday night during which I was defeated by a 5 year old in Settlers Junior.
@_christina_ the issue is fb is now more of a contact list rather than a content site.
@_christina_ FB has not solved content curation (boring, bad for mobile). G+ fails to have enough content. Twitter &amp; tumblr are pretty good.
@_christina_ it's not a people problem, it is a tech problem. Content curation is one if the major themes of the Facebook generation.
Apparently my work schedule for "release week" starts at sun up. Wish that meant I was done at sun down. 
upon reflection, if you do not own downton abbey and don't have hulu plus, perhaps you don't deserve to get it as a gift? hmm.
the question is not whether to buy downton abbey seasons 1&amp;2 on amazon deal of the day. the question is how many should I buy?
@mosaicdistrict nice night!! 
This Christmas brought to you by Target. 
@saroy see, what happens is, when a boy duck and a girl duck reaaly love each other...
So I guess it is Christmas now. 
@_christina_ ugh, kids making you sick is the worst... hope @harperben takes good care of you...
Good news, the yuppies have found my theater so it'll stay in business. Bad news the yuppies bought alls the tickets so I can't see Lincoln.
People who can sew: I would love to turn this scrap souvenir from Panama into a pillow. Christmas present anyone? 
@_christina_ oh, poor short ones!! Did doc say if they will be allowed to fly home?
Happy Black Friday!!! I swear I did not arrange this breakfast this way, it just happened 
Oops I forgot there is also cake OMG I did not properly pace myself... 
Requested pie update... 
@_christina_ pumpkin pie made by Kent's mom... Looks so good...
Must... stay awake... pie cooling one hour... tryptophan causing extreme sleepiness...
Turkey Day. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> 
@_christina_ impressed
@JohnnyGrubb you have no Facebook now? how am I supposed to see your family pictures from time to time?
@norwoodmusic I love it. Let me know if you are ever in DC and we can meet up!
@norwoodmusic I am doing great! Living in VA, working as a project manager for iPhone and Android apps!  you seen any Joseph people lately??
also, how did they get so old and ugly?
when you suddenly recall the name of someone you knew in school so you look for them on fb and they age from 16 to 30 in one second flat.
@norwoodmusic is that a goatee?
@JFSIV @ClarkHoward just like Clark to miss the hottest trend in mobile - WINDOWS
Someone in the office just sneezed seven times in a row. I didn't even know that was possible.
This might have been clever in college, gents, but you have neighbors now. #trashy #getoffmylawn 
This is what my Nokia Lumia 920 looks like while it is wireless charging. #geek #butiloveit 
Irrationally excited about my Nokia Lumia 920 wireless charging stand!! #windowsphone #windowsstore
@DavidSMcDonald me too!! I love it...

#Revenge @Revenge
Now that Apple has proved with iMessage that SMS is pointless, can we just do away with those now?
My sides from Almost Famous. Thanks again for hiring me @CameronCrowe but u cou ...
Instagram alternatives   
Windows Phone. So easy, even a baby can use it. 
@_christina_ I am now a Target professional... I am in there three times a week. Lol.
Testing metweet with photos 
...and then I got a Nokia Lumia 920...
I played with a Nokia Lumia 920 at lunch and now I want one bad...
An iPhone user whose home button is also broken showed me how to properly bang it on the counter to center the rubber button component. SMH
How is it possible that having your eyebrows pulled out is so popular that there are three stations to do so on this mall??
I can't believe assess is an actual word. What other swear word can you add an "s" to and it becomes entirely professional?
It is bedtime. Keep an eye on the election for me while I sleep, please.
"who won?...who won?...who won?" my brain every election day.
America! America! 
I might be leanung towards the 920... Review: Nokia Lumia 920 
Batch 2 with donut baking appliance is much tastier. 
To all my friends that did not get to sleep in because their kids are too young to understand: haha.
Two Presidents and a Governor on stage 
Number of guests that left my neighbors house party this morning: 8 #getoffmylawn
Number of not good donuts I forced myself to eat: 4. #ugh
Homemade donuts and other things that aren't good on my first try #looksgood #butnotgood 
When you go to an impromptu Dia de Los Muertos party, it's a comfort to find costumes on sale at CVS. 
Willy Nelson is ten times the performer than anyone paying tribute to him #CMA #whyamiwatchingcmas
Skipped gym workouts this week due to #Frankenstorm Now I am seriously considering just getting fat this winter and going back in April.
@_christina_ yay! you are my blood donor hero.
Movie posters at our theater are now LCD screens. Now the buttons on the mall coke machine are touch screen. 
This is the song the old man had dreams about: 1 4 8 8 3 8 8 4 8 8 4. Really? That's the magical song you are going with? #notmozart
Cloud Atlas is a great movie, but the theme has been stuck in my head for six days and it is only 8 measures and 4 notes. #shootmenow
It has been 16 years since the movie Scream came out and I still find it to be the scariest costume. #nevecampbell #saveme
@baucs yes, yes it is.
"Trick or Treat" is a weird phrase. Is this 6 year old dressed as a hamburger really going to trick me if I don't give him a laffy taffy?
A real vampire would not have a reflection... 
@yoyoel good thing you wore your galloshes. did the wind blow you down on the way there?
Another day of working from home while @MrManMO marathons Dr. Who. #Sandy #Frankenstorm
@_christina_ ours is back on if you need a place to hang out and/or work.
Power came back on around 4am. 11 hours without power. #Sandy #Frankenstorm
Settlers of Catan by candlelight #Sandy #Frankenstorm 
Saved my evening by visiting friends with power and picking up Papa Johns. #Sandy #Frankenstorm
5:20pm. Power goes out.
So far #Sandy has provided a day for working from home in sweats. Wind and rain in N.VA, but otherwise no drama.
How many days until #SpringTraining?
I was not expecting the Giants to win the #WorldSeries... Yay for the National League.
Most difficult pumpkin I have ever carved, Yoda was. Cool, it is. 
Th Grizzly is a bear of a roller coaster. Calling my chiropractor now... 
Cloud Atlas... Three hours... I hope at least a third or it is entertaining...
Either that or there is often a group of kids screaming outside my office.
The AC at work whistles a little giving the sound of kids screaming on a nearby roller coaster.
@Dec_Geater wow. Netflix next time? Lol.
After 4 hours of meeting starting at 6:30, starting my day completely over at 11. Coffee and oatmeal. #timetowakeup #tgif
Scary Halloween pumpkin on my neighbor's stoop. Carved by the neighborhood squirrles. 
After joining a gym and going for a month I have nearly decided to commit my life to never using weights for anything ever.
iPad mini is way above my impulse buy purchase price. Won't anyone make a new gadget for me to buy myself for Christmas?
Windows RT not supporting Windows Phone apps makes no sense to me whatsoever. Now MS can fragment their industry trailing app marketplace?
@yoyoel airport security is more about how we feel than real safety. The fancy line makes you feel better, so it is a success.
Is anyone else hating themselves for loving the Phillip Phillips song, Home? Or is it just me #badsinger #goodsong
I am sad that I have no compelling reason to watch this #WorldSeries. I think Bud Selig has seriously messed up the post season. =(
It's a sad day when you realized the yogurt you stocked up on turns out to be nonfat. #extrafatplease
I am seriously getting tendonitis in my thumbs from using touch screens and I don't know what to do about it.
One of those days when you forget to wear a belt and you don't notice until lunchtime. #sleepy
I love that wiki pages like this exist.  I generally root for the team with the longest drought... Go Tigers? 
@idrawclouds awesome! When will they be available to see in stores?
@yoyoel sign me up!
@yoyoel are you allowed to post your ICA submissions online? I want to read them.
"Oh -- I'm not --
I'm just here to -- 
I don't have --
I'm here with --

@austindavis130 pretty sure you owe your dad more than $16... so... call it even?
@yoyoel how did you let us leave Philly without trying @LOSBurgerTruck ?
Sometimes I groove to hold music so that I can pretend it is relaxing and not annoying. #selfmedicating
OMG 
BLAMMO! 
Because it's decorative gourd season.

Summer must be over because my feet are cold. I guess they will be warm again in April...
@harperben I am jealous! Also proud that this is still cool - I got one when I was about his age. =)

Why Apple Should Buy Nokia 
@tenorbp yeah we knew that already. Frowny face.
@tenorbp I am super pissed that Freddie did not get himself thrown out... Bobby would have never stood for that.
NFL replacement refs &gt; MLB umpires. #heartbreak
@tenorbp I want to maximize my outrage so I am using fb.
Drove to work early because my wifi wasn't working only to discover I had switched the wifi radio off. #needcoffee
Why is it that my gmail and Facebook have both become junk mail? It is really bad. I don't have time to sift for quality.
@_christina_ I follow cool people. Lol.
Why is Honey Boo Boo taking over my social networks?
Ah, Stephen King can turn a phrase... 
Someone should invent a cure for when I use my smartphone or tablet lying down too long and my hand falls asleep.
@_christina_ ooh. I am now totally out of shape due to vacation and the flu. But I hope the nice weather waits on me. :)
I haven't watched The Price Is Right in years... Legend...I got to see the one with @ActuallyNPH on it...DARY.
@yoyoel unless you are feeding a newborn baby there is no excuse to be up that early...
@saroy some of my friends ordered at 2am, so... Why not?
@mikeheldar well it is better than most shows the year after graduation... did you ever see Saved by the Bell "The new class"? Lol
How did Brittany not graduate? She is 25 going on 40.
@norwoodmusic I request your favorite hymn at DUMC sanctuary! It would sound great!
Bake sale at work is extremely bad for my diet.
truth... 
But started a new tradition of seeing my nephew on Labor Day! Loved my visit to WV and only today realized I missed the Labor Day race. :-)
Had a sinking feeling as I passed the neighborhood pool on my morning workout. The summers die one by one. How soon they fly on and on.
The saddest thing in the world is cooking your last bowl of oatmeal and then dropping it on the floor.
@idrawclouds I want to see the end of the commercial when the bike crashes because she's not looking where she is going. lol.
Can't believe I am 1770 weeks old now. #babylingo #somanybabiesomg
"Hang on, let me get my titties right," said the lady we encountered getting her photo made at the King Memorial.
@JohnnyGrubb haha. I like that guess but I can't spell that. Lol.
Remembered my obscure password for an AIM account I haven't used in six years. Amused to find my icon is Anakin Skywalker.
phase one of operation "shock and awe" performed on our back yard hashtag I have never seen so many weeds in my life lol
still following Olympians on twitter. someone please tell them that Olympic rings tattoos look stupid... never mind... it's too late.
@saroy did you enjoy my complaining that you were off twitter while having a baby? Lol.
@_christina_ haha
today was an excellent day to sit at home watching the west wing all day.
@artemis1979 check, check, check, and check.
@artemis1979 sad you did not drive down last night! we had a blast with @yoyoel
@yoyoel yay?
@yoyoel Kent wants some banana bread... with nutella if possible. lol.
@saroy please feel free to inundate us with pictures of Emma. so cute, and babies change every day! guess we have to visit Houston now, huh?
@saroy why aren't you replying to my tweet about the astros? what could you possibly be so busy with? gosh.
waiting to hear back after an interview is the hardest part of an interview.
@tenorbp cool. I love geek celebrations. =)
@saroy how did I miss this... the Astros are moving to the AL? you're going to cheer for the American League? say it ain't so.
Cool points to everyone who stayed up to watch the Mars landing. None for me.
Really only wanted to see ten seconds of the Olympics today and NBC held it till 11:30. #nbcfail #boltrules
ok, I have a new 
@_christina_ if you're not first, you're last
omg I can't stop buying things on amazon until it's time to make a birthday wishlist, then I can't think of anything to add...
somehow, watching the Olympics makes me want to go back to visit Australia...
@saroy that woman announcer was mean! She said one of the Chinese guys was "terrible" on pommel horse and he wasn't too bad! So dramatic...
I would like to start a petition to move "prime time" one hour earlier. #sleepy #olympics #oldgeezer
@tenorbp dc is totally too hot!! How's Philly? Tell Will I said (insert fart)!
@_christina_ which song?
finally achieved the elusive "500+" connections designation on LinkedIn. random useless goal: achieved.
following 20 Olympians + Flipbook on my Google Nexus 7 = twitter has never been this interesting.
@yoyoel I tried that once and learned that "fragrance free" means extremely smelly.
still 2 days till #LondonOlympics and I'm already turning into a junkie. This is not good...
when I send emails to myself, I always include my name. why do I do that?
@yoyoel or, the obvious choice, 
@yoyoel This one depicts you venting on twitter in a funny way to make people smile. 
2 hours spent uninstalling various things to get Flash to work on Chrome. Still doesn't work. Can we make Flash not a thing anymore?
@_christina_ stop bragging about your beautiful new deck. lol. it is nice weather today, but I stupidly ran in the 90 degree heat yesterday.
just blew up my twitter. 
Wait, I am confused. Sally Ride really has a sister named "Bear"? Bear Ride?
@_christina_ wow you are behind... you should be at the indiscriminately throwing things into the back seat of your car stage by now...
GT Career fair job description begins "Are you a nerd who can talk to people?". Actually, YES!
Got my tickets for Dark Knight Rises and I'm excited about it! I don't expect it can surpass Heath Ledger's performance, but should be good.
there are two flies in this starbucks. both are permanently residing on this lady with the iPad. it has been 30 minutes. is it her perfume?
@saroy I really hate armadillos. They can jump three feet in the air!
this is just to say I stubbed the bejezus out of my big toe. it bled everywhere. and I dont' have anyone to pity me for it.
Please. Leave me behind. 
Save yourself. Don't look back. 
Get. 
You get now, go on. Get! 
I said  ...
@seldo I have to block websites on my work computer and I have a different laptop that I use for breaks...
@harperben weirdly, I know how to spell souvenirs, and was unsure how to spell guitar picks? pik? pic? piq? pique?
Unrelated, I like a parent that acknowledges that their 0 year old is 0.
Number of items I had to google how to spell in that last tweet: 3.
Souvenirs I just found hidden in my travel Dopp kit: 1 fleur-de-lis bottle opener from New Orleans. 5 guitar picks from the Kennedy Center.
Called Washington Nationals Box Office, was told their terrible rain out exchange policy, and then was hung up on by Brandon. #servicefail
@yoyoel Natural peanut butter needs to be refrigerated. Normal peanut butter does not.
@website_blocker #bug #chrome This did not work for me at all. Uninstalled.
The problem with weekends is that coffee is good for breakfast and cold pizza is good for breakfast but coffee and pizza don't mix.
It's amazing how many ugly curtains exist at Bed Bath and Beyond.
this is the point in the day where I should be going for a run.
@yoyoel I have heard of "A-town" and ATL, but that's a new one to me.
soooooooo distraaaaaaaaaacted. stop being interesting, internet. I demand it right this minute!
@benpettit I am not sure. 75 or so...
today I learned about Higgs boson, video conversations with your future self, Spidey CG, and robots controlled with your mind. Youtube win.
@_christina_  Chicago popcorn is good, but not worth driving 600 miles for. Yes, the boys are back in town.
@_christina_ can I come over and eat popcorn?
I think instead of watching the Newsroom, I'm going to go back and watch the West Wing from the beginning. Gotta have Allison Janney.
there is nothing like a $10 fireworks show. I'm not saying it's good, I'm just saying there's nothing like it.
I started to read the declaration of independence today but it's just too many words... #twitterbrain
A baby nephew with hiccups is maybe the cutest thing ever.
you know you are in the country when you can't get on the internet because it is raining (aka: why it took me 30 minutes to tweet this).
@_christina_ obviously... metaphor for what? lol. I'll be home Saturday or Sunday.
@_christina_ monkeys?

In 20 minutes, I will be an uncle.
I should mention I had a dream that I befriended Stephen King and he wrote a detailed friendly inscription in his book for me.
missed breakfast due to an emotional roller coaster of a day. I think it's time for some cereal.
people say it all works out for the best, but I prefer my brother in law who told me today "change is uncomfortable... that's just reality."
the thing is, Tiger Woods may never win another major. and you never know when you favorite band is going to stop touring.
hmm 
@JFSIV Wikipedia says the term went out of use in 2010 but they used to all be alternative...
@_christina_ I'm guessing brick business lead to boo boo picture?
@JFSIV they used to be called alternative rock, but maybe that is not a term anymore...
4. Adam Duritz is 48 years old.
What's worse? 1. People here are old. 2. There are teenagers here that are the kids of Counting Crows fans. 3. The program says "folk rock".
The most enthusiastic person among 10,000 about this opening band (including the band) is the person signing the lyrics. I hate him.

Just rewatched Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close to confirm that it is in fact the saddest movie ever made.
It's a banner day in the stay at home job search. I surpassed 100 applications and the ice cream truck switched to a different song finally.
Beautiful weekend has turned into a hot week. Wondering if I will be running at all this week...
@_christina_ no motivation on Sunday... it's the day of rest... lol.
Prometheus is good although a tad confusing.  =)
@saroy Yeah we have Aliens on DVR. The line is crazy long.
Rewatched Alien. Now standing in line for Prometheus. High hopes.
@yoyoel I only wear Haynes perfect T's
@norwoodmusic why do you hate vegetables so much! you want them all murdered and eaten! lol.
I think talking on the phone saps my introverted energy even more than talking to someone in person. I just hate forcing being so cheerful.
having one of those weeks where nothing's working and the time pressure is getting to me. waiting for my luck to turn.
sometimes it gets to be 2pm in the afternoon when I realize I am extremely hungry and this frustrates me even though I haven't eaten today.
two asian kids, home from school early, sharing a violin and playing suzuki music outside my window.
@saroy no one knows.
@saroy I'm so disappointed you don't know that I'm not even going to dignify that with an answer.
@JFSIV nope! was watching the Braves...
God, I love baseball.
surprisingly depressed that the Braves game was rained out yesterday and the other games are sold out... =(
@harperben ok, fine. see you there. =)
@_christina_ Canadian border patrol is kind of mean. I don't know why they always do the shake down, but that's their default mode...
@_christina_ I am anxious and impatient about time lately, not related to the seasons. I am excited about summer though...
enjoying my last day of may. I'm not ready for June already. dang.
@_christina_ which one of you gets to go to Harper Blynn this time?  @MrManMO and I are excited about it.
@_christina_ It was actually perfect. I was scared it was going to get hot again so I actually ran already. #miracle
feel as if I should shift my runs to the morning to avoid the heat, but absolutely incapable of motivating myself before breakfast...
just saw the entire Brazil national soccer team. they seemed younger than I expected. I accidentally walked among their entourage/paparazzi.
When you see Dame Judy Dench and she smiles at you when you nod, it is a good day. No, I didn't take a photo. But she is amazing.
@seldo I think a house o'fire is a southern thing. Anything done like a house o'fire is done with great gusto.
@yoyoel I believe U are the big spoon. Do not believe @seldo is FALSE. Lol.
@sarabisms wait... I primarily make white russians with soy milk... is that wrong?
@tenorbp DC is awesome! you should come down for a Nats game. Hopefully we'll be able to see the Phillies this summer! maybe bring the baby!
@JFSIV despite that I know you are nice, you work so hard at not adopting any principles that would demonstrate that.
@JFSIV Cheney wasn't pres and didn't overturn DADT or DOMA. Sad that you never let the Democratic side of your libertarian views show.
@otterriffic sorry to hear. NY will be fun though.
@JFSIV I think what you meant to retweet was "the President was awesome today." don't miss out on progress by being snippy.
@JFSIV exactly... It was a weird quote... Maurice would have laughed... =)
@JFSIV um, he was an atheist...
@yoyoel such a good maurice sendak quote. loved his stories about weird kids. have been listening to fresh air interviews all day...
chat 3 people online. all are asleep. awesome.
can't sleep. what to do. what to do.
facebook during the day is worse than daytime television.
@yoyoel omg. Best internal monologue ever.
@yayblynn how do we buy recordings of the live show tomorrow?
@JohnnyGrubb wow. I make it easy on them - credit cards always have exact change. yesterday I felt bad when I put $1.35 slurpee on credit...
Finally filled up my old 80GB back up external hard drive. Yay I finally get to order a 1TB drive!!!
@_christina_ oh wait, you probably weren't talking about the programming language called "cold fusion." hahaha.
@_christina_ haha. the one and only project in my career where I was lead developer, I wrote the project in cold fusion...
@harperblynn how many downloads so far?
@_christina_ did you see it?
Ten year old with binoculars: "It's coming back!" He was right. Cool! #spottheshuttle
what is the cool hashtag I am supposed to use when I am on my way to #spottheshuttle
@_christina_ are they going to watch? I am meeting up with Becca in a bit to see it. =)
Yay! This record is awesome. Awesome and free. Download now, thank me later. 
Haven't used the acronym FTW in too long. Typing it in an email made me feel nostalgic, proving I can be sentimental about anything.
@jfsiv Yes, it is more offensive to have a car elevator than to try to help people in need... How is that a debate?
@yoyoel instant weird mental image of what a beard per capita ratio &gt; 1 would look like.
yay! RT @yayblynn: Paste Magazine decided to stream our record 'til release day!  Busy Hands, in it's entirety, here: 
Everyone needs more HB in their life. RT @yayblynn: Day 2 of premiering new tracks! Listen to 'Lovely Thing': 
@yayblynn I love the daily preview!!  So excited about the new album. Keep up the great work guys.
@_christina_ dang why did you have to use a photographer in Arkansas. =P We are looking for a local one for baby niece.
I hate it when you follow a comedian on twitter and they are not funny and they only hype their tour dates. #unfollow #azizansari
I was sort of rooting against Bubba but he sure made some good shots and it seems somehow fitting for someone named Bubba to win in Georgia.
@tenorbp get ready world!
@_christina_ I think our college experience was very different than most... we actually worked... lol
I wish companies would send a good old fashioned rejection email instead of just leaving a giant black hole. I mean show a little decency...
the problem is, the jetsons simply set the bar incredibly high for flying cars.
I don't know why more people don't give their kids a new last name. There is no law that says you must have your parent's last name...
@artemis1979 golf caddies are more like coaches. The best coaches in the world in any sport do well.
used kindle fire on sale for $139 today. makes me want one, but I'm sure I'd have buyers remorse immediately.
only thing in my fridge/freezer not past its "best by..." date is soda but when did that ever stop anyone from eating the last Klondike bar?
Jinxed it. Here comes the rain.
Enjoying the most beautiful morning for a porch swing and hoping the rain holds off till later.
Well... I'll see you on Facebook... =(
I root against any team that doesn't have the good sense not to wear orange... Bad call Peyton...
Amazon is giving away money again... $10 
I am definitely having an "I don't wanna" week. Haven't exercised. Procrastinating things on my "to do" list. Gonna be a long week...
It is strange to me that "going somewhere for Spring Break" was only an event in my life for like two years...
ok I wore my green shirt for breakfast but now I'm totally over it.
I'm not sure how long frozen chicken nuggets are good for, but I'm drawing the line at "Best By: 2009".
Having trouble with my pacing on this flat trail run. Accidentally bested my 5k time at 26:23 but then I was to tired to finish my 4. sigh.
@yoyoel to win you usually have to submit 3... 1 for favorites. 2nd with some upsets. 3rd totally random guessing. or just pick state names.
@_christina_ alllllllll the tiiiiiiime. lol.
I think the real saving grace of the human race is that mostly, people are boring.
@saroy I love the cities at night, but can't find any hi res images of them. have you already hunted for that?
@_christina_ prioritizing is good for you and ultimately good for your company!
Subway by me has no spinach, mozzarella, nor cucumbers. Tomatoes: mushy. Jalapenos: crunchy. And no caffeine free diet drinks. Very sub-par.
There are few things in life as satisfying as walking to the platform as you train is arriving and strolling right on.
Wendy's. There is no better place to get lunch for $2.12.
the glories of a flat, gravel trail run. Ran further than planned - 5.54 mile at a surprisingly comfortable and steady 8:58 pace.  
fancy salesman uses iPad to draw up a quote. spends 20 minutes inputting data. hits the home button. "oh, crap I lost all my work." fancy.
US saying: "Don't let the cat out of the bag." UK version: "Don't let the rabbit out of the bag." What's with animals in bags?
Today I ran 6.62 miles, 9.16mil/hr, &gt; 10k for my long run two weeks in a row!! not bad, but I still hate the 4th mile... slowest of the day.
There might have been more than average dancing during my Michael Jackson infused 10k workout today. 56:56, 9:09 min/mi #blameitontheboogie 
@seldo OH, maybe he was only naming the cars he actually drives. Not the cars his drivers drive.
@seldo I honestly do not believe they only own 4 cars.
@_christina_ really? haha. I never use "dear" for anything. with mixed groups, I used "hi all" or "hello team" most commonly.
@_christina_ I use "guys" for emails that include only males. What informal name do you prefer for groups of females? (never happened to me)
Wow! Just finished my 7k (4.35 mi) workout in 38:35. That's 8:50min/mi and 30 seconds/mi faster than on Monday. An amazing spring day - 60°.
you know you celebrated Fat Tuesday correctly when it is lunch time on Wednesday and you are *not hungry*.
#worst #fat tuesday #glee #ever
@_christina_ no and no...  but fine, take fake holidays I don't care. Lol.
@andrewsantelli um - when was that? Did not see Conan at all...
@_christina_ can't believe you get president's day off.
Did not, did NOT want to run today. But ran 7k at 9:20min/mi pace anyway. Promised myself I don't have to run tomorrow if I don't want to.
sudden and overwhelming urge to rewatch Dr. Horrible. please make a sequel @ActuallyNPH and @NathanFillion !!
isn't it nice to hear the words "pitchers and catchers report." it should be a national holiday. most of the Braves have reported early.
@andrewsantelli how old is little jelly now??
7k @ same pace as my 5k run on Monday (9min/mi). Hooray for adding endurance. Thanks to +Gavin Mendeck for tips on strengthening exercises.
@saroy see that's why you shouldn't drink an entire bottle of wine by yourself on a thursday night. =)
@artemis1979 apparently it was a coincidence... Very very spooky coincidence...
Slower than average 7k today. Running friends - what do you do to decrease impact on shins? Stretches, workouts, running style? 
5k in 28 minutes today. 9 minute miles, but still slower than last week. My theory: Counting Crows tempos are slower than Adele.
I wish the Grammy's had people's name on the screen at all times. I do not know any of these people. #whoisthat #grammys
@_christina_ woot!  she's coming to DC soon!
skipped my Tuesday workout and my shins thanked me with a 41min 4.5 mi run! 9:04 min/mi with one walk break to fix my mp3 player lol.
@seldo also helps with chit chat during an interview.
@seldo I disagree. When I was doing a lot of hiring, hobby notes gave me good feedback for whether folks would be a good fit for the team...
@_christina_ hmm. best thing about running is that I actually interact with nature for the only times in my day. and I'm not up early...lol.
@JFSIV I think your speed work must be helping. I had a nice 5k time today.
5k. 26:29. 8:31 min/mile. tired shins. beautiful weather. scared that when it actually gets hot out I will not be able to run at all. =)
The awkward silence on a conference call when a trainer tells a joke, but everyone is on mute so no one laughs.
4.4 miles in 41:41 which is spot on a 10k/hour pace. Really didn't want to run today which makes me more when I am done.
Rewarding myself for early meeting by enjoying a hot cocoa snack. Hot chocolate has been my drink this winter!
Wow, I am severely grumpy after that 6am meeting. I mean, it was a great meeting but now I feel like crawling back into bed, but I can't. =/
@JFSIV @_christina_ it's true, I'm the only person in the world that likes Glee except that I don't like any of the music.
I ran 4 miles today without stopping to walk. On a beautiful, Spring, January day. lol.
@JFSIV show off.
@JFSIV wow you are going to do the speed work for @saroy and me? thanks James!
@saroy for me, speed work consists of "oh, crap it is &lt;insert bad weather here&gt;". Freezing rain day was the fastest I have ever run. lol.
@saroy seems like with your marathon work it would make the 5k times go down, right?  I want to train for a 10k and then try a 5k PR.
I *felt* like running 5mi last week really helped with my 3.6mi route today. The *data* says my pace has been the same for two months. lol.
@yoyoel sounds fun. lmk when you're in town. hopefully the weather stays nice for you. =)
@_christina_ hahaha, no glad u wanted them. =)
@_christina_ no - fate has little to do with it. it's just people. congrats on your serif strategy. love it when a plan comes together. =)
@_christina_ shocking turn of events! what changed your mind about serifs?
@semicologne I hope you followed that tweet by kicking someone into a well.
Yes! I made it to 5 miles today. 5.08 miles in 51:02. Not bad pacing either - I took two 3 minute walk breaks so I could make it. 
@_christina_ sorry I don't do scramble. Stresses me out.
@saroy no but Iread both on my iGoogle homepage. I guess I usually don't have a comment for the blog... Just for you. Lol.
@saroy I don't ever go to your blog. I read your blog in an RSS reader which is in the same place as my twitter... lol.
@artemis1979 are you still friends with Irwin?
@saroy haha. yeah, I did the same thing with the Hunger Games. fast fast reads.
Boy, I really crash after 3 miles, but I finished 4.6 grueling ones today. Had it in my mind I could run 5. I couldn't. 46:47 (10:03 pace).
@NathanFillion you are funny. trying to get "polo" to trend? lol.
@NathanFillion Polo
My experiment following the cast of Modern Family has failed.  Hard to be funny IRL... Makes me find @NathanFillion all the more amazing.
@ericstonestreet you are strange. Lol. #stonestreet
@saroy toss it and get a Nokia Windows Phone.
24 hours later, this still makes me really happy, so I'm sharing. Who knew that President Obama could sing? 
Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is the saddest movie ever made full stop. I'm sure I have never cried that much in a movie. Bring tissues.
1. Doorbell rings, no one there. 2. I step outside - Doorbell rings by itself while I am on the stoop! 3. I ring the doorbell - Not a sound.
@_christina_ blame google.
@_christina_ sans serif for the web.
@_christina_ idk. google tells me a serif font of 12 points is generally accepted for the text portion of formal documents such as reports.
@Keenan_Rogers don't you ever attend classes?
@_christina_ hahaha. I hope pete gets toy-a-fied.
sluggish run today, but beautiful weather. 3.7 in 35:33. SportsTracker tells me this is 2 min slower than I ran that route last week... lol.
whew. finally. "Thank you for your application for the PMP Credential. Once your application has been reviewed, you will be notified..."
@otterriffic are you saying it's not 50/50?
@artemis1979 that's racist
spotify updates on facebook are weird, but it is effective peer pressure when more than one of your friends is listening to fleet foxes.
Cool. #15 all time. @JFSIV check it out - 
@_christina_ ben needs to work on his aim. lol.
@saroy posted to twitter accidentally. see Google+.
I believe I just set a PR running 5k in 26:44. I don't remember any number in the 26es  before. I credit Adele again... and the bitter cold.
Sometimes I just want to go back to before smartphones and dual screens and kindles and just drink coffee and read the newspaper. Sometimes.
Everyone in this game is too fat to score. #bcsisstupid #backawayfromthebuffet
@JFSIV awesome story. weird  blog. =)
@Keenan_Rogers He filmed a Hallmark movie in my home town... He was nice..
@Keenan_Rogers I once ran lines with Richard Dean Anderson.
@saroy jealous. now I'm thinking of something you can sew for me!!
sometimes I forget that the internet is not real life.
managed a cold, short 2.35 mile run today. spot on 9 minute miles and pretty consistent throughout. good to get back in the groove.
@_christina_ adorable.
I forgot to make resolutions this year, but I have a feeling 2012 is gonna have a mind of it's own...
@iMiiitch my parents watched all the harry potters with me in one day. it was epic.
@mikeheldar no it's a holiday...
5k today in 28:14 today. beautiful weather. 
@TGKW on the contrary - thank you Tommy for bringing your life and your work to so many people. Hope you know that you are truly inspiring!
@benpettit I love mine! hope you enjoy it. =)
@yoyoel kids in karate class wear white belts. Does anyone else?
survivor challenges still make my heart race. and ozzy is the best survivor in challenges ever.
@_christina_ just that humans do in fact wear stockings...
@_christina_ non-humans do not wear stockings
my brain has melted. may I start my Christimas holidays now, please?
omg I love apples.
2.76 miles at 8:48 min/mile pace today. Fast start and slower all the way. Heavy legs got sore, so I stopped but still farther than planned.
Anyone who thinks it's dumb to say "Happy Holidays" clearly hasn't had meetings scheduled with people in China, India, Turkey, and Egypt.
@JoshDaws true... I tried to sell it too but to no avail.. =D
haven't run for a week due to weather. knocked out 5k in 29:19. 9:23 min/mile. Proud that the last mile was the fastest at 8:50. 
omg. just discovered that the blog domain I gave up last year is now being squatted on and is now for sale for $4,188.  
if you are married to someone that you started dating during your last marriage, a "fidelity" pledge after vows is just a lie and joke.
Having a hard time with my amazon wishlist... kindle has eliminated my printed book wishes, netflix has elminated many of my blu ray wishes.
working from home means rocking a baseball cap, christmas sweater, pajama pants, and fluffy slippers on a conference call with no shame.
easy mac is proof that there is no limit to how many preservatives I'll cram into my body for the sake of expeditiously curbing a craving.
It's very sad to me that once you get up early for a 1 hour meeting, it's impossible to go back to bed and pick up right where you left off.
This time last year I was having drinks in the Philippines to celebrate the birthday of @unclebp but he wasn't with us. #forthehomies =)
@semicologne try just holding your hand up to your face as the x-ray goes by. "oops!"
I hate it when the relaxed, care free part of my personality gives way to the concerned, stressed out subconscious. 
@seldo I'm also biased, but I love my WP.
Also looking for a church to go to tomorrow. Being snarky about churches based on their website and the credentials of their music director.
Oscar season has started. might be time for first double feature of the season. maybe "Ides of March" then "Descendants". too much Clooney?
I have been running outside more this fall than usual.  
Nice long run today - 4.50 miles in 42:54. Perfect weather!!! easy 9:32 pace. Started faster but last mile was 10:37. guess I got tired. =)
@harperben did you chat him up?
started watching "American Horror Story." Still don't  understand how/why Hulu has things online (free) but not on Hulu Plus (paid)?!?
ran my Monday route again and found the problem - there is a HUGE HILL. first 1.5 miles on 8:27 min/mi pace. 3.73 miles total 9:03 pace.
People say that winter is better because you can always "dress warmly" but it's not true. I am cold all winter long...  
@saroy you can watch survivor on 
@_christina_ no fair! I need Ben to bake cookies at our house. =)
year end vacation max = December where my company says "you must take 6 vacation days and 4 holidays in the next month!" gee... ok.
Stop Carter, Stop!  I need that Forrest Gump sign to curb my holiday amazon addiction. Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Cyber Week... eek!
@_christina_ haha. Apparently only when I am too cold... Yesterday was so much slower...
testing tweet from google plus!
omg. cold and raining. ran a fast 20 minutes, covered 2.5 miles. 7:59min/mi pace. what?! guess freezing to death is an inspiration.
after waiting for over two years, "It's a Wonderful Life" finally went on sale on amazon. That's the power of wishlists...
though, happy that I had a 8:36 pace through 1.7 miles...
ran/walked 3.36 miles in 33:32 (9:58 pace).  this is what I hate about running - 1 week off and I was completely spent after 1.75 miles.
Car wash and oil change. Feeling productive by outsourcing car maintenance to other people...
It might be Thanksgiving if you awaken to the smell of food cooking...
went to honey baked ham for lunch mostly because I like to be places where shoppers are losing their minds. it was an engine of efficiency.
@saroy deal of the day on amazon. u should buy it.
today I am busy wondering "do I need a new laptop?" and "do I need a new tv"?  #blackfriday #gadgetfreak
walked by someone's office as they were typing "yt?" in an IM to me. why yes, I am here. magical IM called me forth.
@saroy I am old school about movies and music. I still buy CD's too (even though I immediately rip them into mp3 format).
the question is... do I even want all the star trek movies?  seems like something I should want, but not sure I would actually watch them...
office uses white noise generators to make conversations more private. therefore I have to use noise cancelling headset to make it quiet...
during black friday week I have to continually remind myself that the best way to save money is not to spend money.
10pm. as late as I can stay up. zzz.
@_christina_ any time she sounds like she is in pain, I run faster. which is pretty often when you think about it.
@_christina_ I am crediting Adele at this point. lol.
ran 3.0 miles in 25:30. Apparently I ran 8:30min/mi today but I'm not sure why. might be flatter terrain. or might be new shoes. or Adele.
Q&A was lightly attended so I got to ask 2 questions of my boss's boss's boss's boss. A rare accomplishment.
@norwoodmusic are you around for dinner wednesday?
google voice saved the day. I lost the number for my repair man, but google had it handy (once I remembered his name...)
I know that I should try to save the internet and everything, but I don't want to talk to my congressman ever for any reason. #apathy
I ran 11.3 miles this week at an average pace of 9:15min/mi. Yay!
had a great run today of 3.3 miles in about 30 minutes. really sad that my tracking app crashed again so I don't have data. #addictedtodata
On Survivor last night, Dawn was voted out. One of the people voting for her spelled her name "Don". That doesn't seem like it should count.
Imagine the surprise on non-listening people's face when they go to open an egg for lunch that they got from the last in the tray.
Sometimes people don't listen, which is funny if you say "there are hard boiled eggs in this box, except the last one in the tray is not."
Ran &gt;3 miles at lunch in about 30 minutes (lost part of my data). 9:11 min/mi pace. I think cooler weather = faster pace, but slow 3rd mile.
@saroy my alaskan friend reports it's 40 below there now. incredible!
@AndyStanley There is great Hanukkah music out there, though not played as much.
@AndyStanley Dradle dradle dradle...
@AndyStanley really? Frosty the Snowman?
ran 2.27 miles today in 20:22. 8:59 min/mi. quite a bit faster than yesterday even though my hammies were sore. pushed because it was short.
@_christina_ good luck today!!
@saroy yep. started running at lunch about 3 weeks ago (just started tracking it last week though).  really relaxing, and beautiful weather.
ran 2.7 miles in 26:20 (9:48 pace) at lunch. Legs tired, but weather beautiful.
I can't get over the fact that the guy sitting next to me at this restaurant ate the last slice of pizza left by the previous people.
reading the hunger games trilogy @_christina_
clever. borrowed a book for "free" from amazon. ended in cliffhanger. only one free borrow per month. must... buy... next book... now...
on a conference call this morning (not for work!). enjoying listening to @JFSIV run Great Urban Race! fun technology in play.
In a theater with over 100 empty seats, it is not ok to sit right next to me. It's called a courtesy seat smelly dude. #movingdown
ran 2.25 miles in 20:30 (6.57mph or 9:07min/mile). usually run further but I think @_christina_ broke my calves with a new running style. =)
a number day is going to happen again next year, but I still distinctly remember when it was 8/8/88. 9 and 10 don't really stand out though.
@devonr13 WOW! no wonder napster was so fast when I was at GT. lol.
I use too many commas. Why didn't someone teach me this? Any time I edit my own stuff, all I do is delete commas everywhere. sigh.
ran 3.0 miles in 29:05 at lunch. 6.19mph or 9:41min/mile pace. a bit slower, but enjoying the fall weather. forgot to time my tuesday run.
so, apparently "bat phone" is a globally excepted term meaning a direct phone hotline connecting two parties.  who knew?
1. I don't get all the hype about the FEMA emergency alert test. 2. Seems pointless if they are not alerting us via twitter or facebook.
one of my favorite conference call expressions is "yeah, no". As in "yeah, no we are doing that."
@mikeheldar but you can imagine it was awesome dancing instead of how ridiculous it actually was. wait, darn now you know it was ridiculous.
first conference call of the day starts with dance music! glad that I work from home so I can do a dance in my seat with no one watching.
do people still use business cards? is it uncouth to text or email your contact info?
I love $5 baseball caps.
if I have to transition away from working at home, I'm going to have to seriously work on my likelihood to burst into nonsense singing...
ordered running shoes online first time ever. so happy I can get the same kind I currently have. thank you @brooksrunning and @amazon.
Ran 3.6 miles at lunch in 33:39, 6.38mph or 9:24 min/mi pace. Slowed down after 2 miles, but enjoyed the weather.
@saroy oh, I'm past that. I buy ebook if at all possible. It's worth twice as much to me as paperback.
@saroy there are a *lot* of books by your bed. are you guys not on kindle?
had a dream last night I went back to my high school and all my old teachers were there. asked them for career advice, got no good answers.
swiss and mustard sandwich is so much less than turkey swiss and mustard
cool. that's a good one. RT @windowsphone: Running late to a meeting? Let everyone know by tapping the “late” button 
Used #LocalScout today to find some good food nearby while running errands at lunch. Now I'm soooo full. #wpword #phillycheesteak
Bookshelf contains pictures, books, music, and games. Amazing that my cell phone also contains all these things (and more of them...)
@JohnnyGrubb haha. I have a friend named Ben Harper, but it's not THAT Ben Harper.  =)
@windowsphone is there any screen capture tool to do this?
saw a link to a magazine I wanted to read. clicked on "buy magazine". then I realized they wanted to print out the internet and mail it?!?
@devonr13 did the goal posts come down?
What kind of stupid place doesn't have a Waffle House within 20 miles. That's so back woods.
I used to confuse Tony Larusa with another major league manager but I can't remember who. Any ideas?
I liked my Windows Phone before Mango. Now I would say I'm getting kind of addicted. Wait... how do I say that without sounding like an ad?
@JohnnyGrubb it's the out of tuneness that makes it work... I wish there were ever Glee songs that were out of tune... lol.
@_christina_ at least the jackets are in the closet, and not in every room of the house (unlike the evil BBB "coupon" scams). =)
could write a book on the things wrong with Adele - Rolling In The Deep, but can't explain why I nevertheless love that song. wrong of me?
@_christina_ are you questioning my passing complaint about things there are too many of? lol.
things there are too many of: music players, web browsers, jackets in my closet.
wait, so last.fm is just like pandora? (just now using age old website... makes me feel old... I don't get this new-fangled technology! lol.
@Keenan_Rogers napping is good but I only realized after graduating that I was sleep deprived for five years.
@JohnnyGrubb more like snatching a tie from the jaws of defeat, then snatching a tie from the jaws of defeat, THEN snatching victory. lol.
OMG I stand corrected. One more day of baseball!! Woo hoo! That was fun.
the sounds of those two home runs may mean the end of the baseball season... sigh.
"stop trying to keep up, measure up or catch up" good advise?
@seldo I was just wondering that... Please post the winners...
@_christina_ yay! Glad they liked them. Cool video!
@tenorbp you know it. U gonna visit?
I have a video from when I was 11 where my social studies class debated whether the US should be involved on the ground in Iraq...
still one month out from having my new Kindle Touch... but... but... 
so... he might have jumped the gun by 8 years or so, but... mission accomplished! should we make a new banner, or... 
@saroy I think that's rational anger.
working with global coworkers for years, yet I still find earlier timezones seem "so productive" and later timezones seem "so lazy"...
You have to look past the crazies at Occupy Wall Street to see the good points which is a good lesson for most of what happens in life. #OWS
I am happy that the particles did not exceed the speed of light. I am sick of "science" changing it's mind every few years. =)
@tenorbp yes!
imagine there's no pizza. I couldn't if I tried.
carter: "if it were me I wouldn't drop a bomb anywhere." kent: "except 60 minutes. I would totally bomb that. I hate that show."
@_christina_ nothing about that picture makes sense to me. =)
I was craving pancakes real bad... 
hungry for pancakes
behind, exhausted, doomed, but happy to be back in the US at least.
@JohnnyGrubb My hunger threshold is too low and the same part of my brain that tricks me into hitting "snooze" tricks me into stopping. =)
any work that is not done before dinner is sooo hard to get done after. I am not able to focus my brain on this document. at all.
holy cow this is a long but interesting rant. makes more sense why G+ is not gaining more ground against fb. 
unceremoniously passed 5000 tweets.
is "dummy" meaning "a placeholder used as a temporary substitute for the real thing" considered offensive? eg: creating a dummy document.
@seldo *adding Neuromancer to the growing list of sci-fi books on my kindle wish list*
I own six copies of Ender's Game. Yet I just put it on my Kindle wish list... lol...
@windowsphone why isn't there an app for custom ring tones? make it easier please.
@saroy I think to stretch a canvas you need special clamps, a bit of knowledge, and patience... what I understand from my friend who did it.
@saroy it was not hard because I have a friend that does that as a hobby. I suggest getting byron to do it. =)
@saroy when I tried to do this, I found a place in California that looked promising... but ended up printing mine at the GT Student Center.
finished "Needful Things" by Stephen King and tonight I am lonely for the company of the imaginary friends in Castle Rock.
@areyousuprised also, what did you say to the guy with the sign?
@areyousuprised that guy needs more room on his sign for the other things Leviticus says...
@JFSIV so you're saying computers are bad at predicting our inevitable demise?
@areyousuprised yay! glad you could make it out. wish I could be there.  you are truly inspiring.
I'm not sure how but my gmail account is full of things I want to unsubscribe from. Secretly, I think I just like getting frequent messages.
Having a cleaning lady enter the men's room while you are there is off-putting. Having two enter with lively banter is out of control.
@_christina_ so, you're saying that "y'all" is not accepted in your professional documentation? lol.
It is always a joy to watch the Yankees lose.
@vernonwalker hmm. I just keep thinking how fast the parking lots would overgrow with trees the moment the last human is gone forever.
I don't know what people mean when they say "change the world".
@JohnnyGrubb I'm drinking the kool-aid... Nokia will have WP soon and they will be awesome...
@JohnnyGrubb the future otherwise known as "welcome to Windows Phone a year ago"
had a 20oz diet coke yesterday forgetting 1) I don't drink caffeine and 2) if I do it's a tiny bit. made me feel like I was gonna explode.
@windowsphone why not just let me use mp3's as ringtones directly... too many steps...
I wish I didn't hate "Arrested Development" so I could be cool and excited about it coming back.
already in baseball withdrawal. when do pitchers and catchers report?
@saroy by the end I was just feeling badly for them. combo of old men in pain and young men in over their heads. it was tough, long season.
@JFSIV that's like saying a marathon should only be 18 miles. the options are 154 or 162. kickoff the silly football after the World Series.
Braves had some bright spots this year but just couldn't grind out the marathon. 162 is a lot.
Now I know what the NY Mets must have felt like all those times they collapsed.
OMG Braves get this DONE
kent: ask google how to fix a garmin touchscreen. me: google says try using high tech pressure applying devices (rubberbands) kent: works!!
only just now connected the product "kindle" to the verb meaning "to make fire".  lol.
irrationally excited about the Kindle Fire tablet...
hey @google since I get more updates on buzz and google reader than I do on plus, why not make the obvious integration?
@clnhll once a got a 20 on a final. that's 20/100.
what do you do at the end of a long work day when you're working from home? closing the laptop just doesn't seem dramatic enough.
I was just struck with the sudden and overwhelming desire to drive from London, UK to Glasgow, UK.
when people talk to you on IM and then quote themselves on twitter. lol.
@yoyoel Eggling! Never seen that before! I want one!
capital punishment is dumb. also, the state of georgia.
@_christina_ yay!! that's amazing for a red eye.
check to see if your library has kindle now! 
@clnhll that's a good sign. empathetic people are notoriously late, and it helps if therapists are empathetic...
@seldo we literally wore zip off pant legs to the vatican which was a great idea.
@JFSIV I agree... Just push the start back to NOVEMBER!!!
annoyed that football is a "thing" already.
comcast: we can upgrade you for only $5 a month more. me: what is my current bill? comcast: insane. me: can you stop ripping me off instead?
@JohnnyGrubb bath in a creek? that is seriously old school. seems funny that you are living the frontier 1800s life except you have twitter.
file folders. I know UI guys think they are out of fashion but I get REALLY cranky without them. looking at you google music.
not being available on netflix nor hulu streaming is a deal breaker for tv for me and not being on kindle is starting to be for books...
@mikeheldar it's faster for the maintenance guy if he puts them all on the left.
I have spent 2 hours a day for the past 2 weeks with Don Draper which is more than I've spent with anyone else (either real or fictitious).
@_christina_ I'm looking forward to some whooville waffles soon.
apparently drinking caffeine in the afternoon makes 5:30 come faster.
bootlegs explain why google music tells me I have "211 songs on 23 albums" for Counting Crows. high considering they have 5 studio albums.
my fav Counting Crows bootleg is of the band drunk at a bar in New Orleans (Shim Sham). unfortunately it's mono left speaker only. lol.
@yoyoel so... apparently swarthmore is 15th most rigorous in the nation... 
@mikeheldar thanks bud! twitter is an underrated forum for literature. lol.
reading a few Billy Collins poems per day. mostly I enjoy them. though, often I think "he could have said this simpler on twitter."
haha.  RT @harperblynn: Lost power in Philly last night only to learn that Whynot is a robot. #robotbassplayer #irene
@tenorbp oh yeah, pks are dumb. =)
@tenorbp what is pks?
@seldo @yoyoel that was the funniest commentary on the apple CEO change I have read. thanks guys. lol.
my flip flop broke and now I have "Margaritaville" stuck in my head
The oldest person in the world turned 115 today. This made me realize I will certainly not live past the year 2093.
thanks a lot @tenorbp now I'm tracking hurricane irene. 
@_christina_ I was never that kid. I was always slightly OCD about dirt.
@_christina_ why are you home from work?
@saroy is there a vehicle on the ISS to get people home even if we send no vehicles up?
@saroy more info please.
debating between mad men and movie night. MLIA.
Google says Fox News says the bureau says a producer says a Captiol Hill Police officer says that the Washington Monument might be tilting.
@tenorbp you can do it!
@JFSIV that makes exactly as much sense as a diet without exercise.
@mikeheldar that's mobydickulous
Just so you know, I have been in a cranky mood all week!
@semicologne I feel the same way about beers I'm now too snobby to drink.
@JohnnyGrubb that's a lot of exclamation points...  lol.
@tenorbp jealous! good times. =)
I was prank called by a 3 year old at 5am this morning and now I am sleepy. I don't know how parents get anything done with so little sleep.
@tenorbp that's awesome! pencil in your calendar for NY at New Year's... =)
@tenorbp Oh yeaaaaaaaaahhhhhh...
@tenorbp I don't know what that is?
weird that two people replied to tell me the democrats are going to beat me up. um...
my major fear in politics is that someone who would have beaten me up in high school might be in charge of laws that beat me up now.
annoying: when people don't read my emails. also, when I have not read someone else's email and I ask dumb questions. also, reading emails.
anytime someone says "wfh" meaning "working from home" I always think "waffle house..." mmm... waffle house...
1. people using nearly incomprehensible grammar. 2. people fwding me long email threads as an "FYI" without taking 30 seconds to summarize.
attention british people "fight back" is two words. geez, learn english.
weird that the internet is still becoming more useful to me. already search, bank, watch tv, listen to music, now books... read.amazon.com
outsourced IT = troubleshooting network connection problem  by asking you to reinstall...
@_christina_ that is *not* cool.  literally.
it is interesting, and perhaps not surprising that my calorie intake jumps 600 calories on Fridays and Saturdays.
books I have &gt; 2 copies of: the dictionary, the bible, Ender's Game, and The Gunslinger. The last 2 I have in 2 languages.
strange that I feel ok about having a shelf of books I will never read, but not ok with donating said books.
so... instant mix on google music is kind of fun...
@mikeheldar I don't know if it is good or not, I was just pointing out that your data was incomplete.
@mikeheldar you have to also compare against our assets. I mean, if you make $50,000/year and  owe that much, but have $1M in assets, good!
@_christina_ sending good day vibes your way!
@saroy this is why I check email before I get out of bed in the morning. lol.
@_christina_ what is making you poke out your eyes? did you accidently sleep with your mother oedipus?
@seldo if ever those functions fail you, you will no longer take them for granted.
this "music cloud" thing must be big. google, amazon, spotify, and zune all competing for my music. haha apple, I didn't list you.
I try so hard to ignore politics, but it never fails to surprise me.
@nickpick77 is it less depressing if I tell you I left one white board messy just for old times sake?
now I am feeling woozy from the whiteboard cleaner, but feeling better otherwise.
I just became possessed by the OCD person inside me. 10 minutes later I had 5 clean whiteboards from the laid off people on my row.
@_christina_ yay!
you know how sometimes you really want to think about something and put it into words, and then instead, you just watch a movie? yeah.
@tenorbp that should be your next tatoo.  lol
@tenorbp can't lose!!!
"May our paths will cross again.  May the force be with you.  Blah, blah, blah, …" We are getting some really classing "good bye" emails...
fb: check. plus: check. livestrong: check. amazon: check.hulu: check. blogs: check. flickr: check. check! CHECK!
@yoyoel re: stupid chase credit cards, I thought it was just me. thanks for helping me realize how dumb they are.
@windowsphone google plus?
@tenorbp you are right. and now I am on it.
@seldo Skittles did not make that video.
@seldo I would add "get what they want or they stop all governing."
I have reached my maximum weight of 172 lbs which means back to counting calories. Any fun social networking or WP7 apps for this?
spending the evening redefining google plus security settings. good times.
@seldo I think that falls under "googling" in the general "searching the internet" sense of the verb.
it's really my own fault, but I have the song from the Neverending Story stuck in my head.
I might be bashing facebook on facebook, and I prefer plus, but sometimes I feel twitter is the only social network that makes sense to me.
@kennysnow wait, bastion's mother's name was moonchild? I am so confused.
@harperben for status, you can get a plugin that will publish tweets to fb and Plus at the same time...
@nokia that link does not show 10 tips. it just shows a battery charger product.
the braves scored nine runs though no player had 2 hits. how weird is that? I wonder if that's some kind of record.
and now I am watching true grit for free. thanks @amazon !
I just got a $5 credit for instant movies and TV shows @amazonvideo. Click 
why? why did I schedule a meeting at 4:30pm on Harry Potter Friday? who does that?
"Worlds are not daydreams but sweatshops." -Robert McKee
@semicologne unfortunately, he won't be the first or the last - 
number one disadvantage of working in an office instead of working from home: arctic air conditioning... brr.
Annoyed that there is no Google plus app yet... =D
@nickpick77 at the peep store. believe it or not.
Dark chocolate covered peeps are the way to go.
yay! RT @saroy: The space shuttle is safely in orbit for the final time. Way to go Atlantis. You were beautiful. And ARE beautiful. #sts135
enjoyed watching the Atlantis launch. thanks for the info @saroy
Finally got on Google+ and it is pretty cool. Kind of the best of facebook + twitter. Loads of potential.
@norwoodmusic wait, did you delete your personal fb page?
how many times must I click on my google+ invite before they let me in?!? a million? worse than the DVM...
@_christina_ my guess is either it is not correct =) or the squiggly line does not understand all the words you used.  ;)
how long until sousa marches stop playing in my head?
I wish I had some resonable excuse to ride on someone's shoulders in the grocery store like the 2 year old in front of me.
@JFSIV I think u r right. The louder the speaker the dumber the comment...
@harperben that is simply outrageous. What are they thinking - as if you would go to the game just because they black it out.
Why is it that if you overhear a conversation at a restaurant, it is never interesting?
@JFSIV way to take a stand, james. rock those umbros and cotton shirts. very 1980's. =)
work is adding profile pictures to our emails, spoiling the imaginary people I made up in my mind... like reading a book made into a movie!
@saroy big time layoffs... =(
@benpettit other way around. I am still there but lots of layoffs...
I am now invited to Google+ but I am in capacity throttled purgatory. uggghhhh. Although, I've never been so happy to be in line.
so many good bye emails this week from close work friends. there is no getting around how depressing that is.
the results are in: new AC resulted in a monthly cost savings of over 33% on energy.That's over $300 a year. not bad.
@tenorbp so far all I see is people asking for invites. I'm not even sure it exists... lol. but you will have invite as soon as I do...
I find ice cream trucks to be a nuisance, a bit scary, and seemingly dirty. #oldmanthoughts
1 day free prime shipping when the warehouse is nearby + shop with points == I love @amazon
wow. last week I complained about no angry birds and no stub hub on WP7 and now they are available. I control the world with my mind!!
my line dropped right after I asked "is there any thing else?" they all responded no and did the good bye dance without me... strange drop.
asked on facebook and no response. tweet peeps: please send me a google+ invite. cause I just gotta try it out for myself.
pandora: perfect for when all decision making seems too much to bear. I need a "pandora" for tv, youtube, or especially dinner selections.
much as I love pi, he does have a point. happy tau day. 
found a note in my pocket: "starting now" "I don't remember you starting here" don't know where this note came from or what it means.
Shoot now I have 'I believe' from 'The Book of Mormon' stuck in my head. Watch it on youtube and u will 2.
@_christina_ haha.  yay decaf!!  =)
here's the thing about interleague play and there's really no way of getting around this: I hate the American League.
@jonathandudley "Why focus on it" is the wrong tact. Paul is very clear on the topic. He was just wrong, which is fine.
jalapenos... causing... my demise... aaa...
sad that the Braves pitchers have to pitch a shutout AND hit a home run to notch a win nowadays. #braves #cant #hit
slept late. read my book. went back to sleep. watched tv. read my book. GOOD DAY SUNSHINE! so lazy I might not be able to sleep tonight. lol
@_christina_ yeppers. I can only take so many newborn pictures on fb before I want to delete all my friends. newborns usually aren't cute.
everyone I know is pregnant, about to be pregnant, or just had a baby. makes me into even more of an introvert than usual.
@saroy spilled ink on mom's table cloth once. used a full bottle of hairspray - after an hour, it was good as new. spray and dab. repeat.
@norwoodmusic there are never any people in your instagrams.
@andrewsantelli that is definitely possible, because reminiscing is often the last thing you do before something ends forever.
just spent 10 minutes reminiscing about phone numbers and the worst customers we had back in the day. boy, I could reminisce about anything.
class done. choir done. summer is here. finally.
when I'm down, and troubled, and I need some love and care, I buy something on amazon instead and that makes me feel a lot better.
I think I have a brain cloud. I knew it. I mean I didn't know it, but I knew it.
I can't remember what we did before wikipedia. I guess people would make obscure references and you had to sit and wonder what they meant.
really, red squiggly line? you feel the need to correct my spelling of shenanigans? that's not even a legit word. for real though, squiggly.
just realized that fb stinks at searchable content. perhaps they don't know that shared content from friends is one of their best features.
Braves game for Father's Day. Check.
going halfsies makes just about anything better.
I think it's time to watch the Matrix on Bluray.
just grilled a coworker on why he would use a disposable cup instead the provided reusable mugs. when did I become an environmentalist?
the great thing about ping pong is even if you lose, if you get in a couple of respectable shots with spin you feel like a champ.
@saroy ooh. I hope he reads your tweet and feels burned.
@_christina_ hahaha.  thanks for that photo. I needed a good laugh.
wow. I am procrastinating studying for my final so bad.
@tenorbp oh boy. hot here too. pool has been nice. hot tub is not open for the season yet... =)
I don't like the phrase "agree to disagree" because it implies that your point of view is valid.
@_christina_ he looks so tall next to thos short people
@_christina_ hahaha.  regardless of whether you say you are brilliant, or someone grabbed your phone, still funny.
@saroy I want an ISS lamp!!!
worked with someone twice a week for a year - he says "this is the first time I have heard you laughing." it's clear I'm a joy to work with.
@artemis1979 PMP
why is it when I am too tired to study, I sit at the computer instead. why not 1) study or 2) sleep? I am so dumb.
@saroy I for one am happy to have 15 years between me an those days... =)
@_christina_ what is he planning to study?  will it be remote or will the boys go to day care?
@saroy your life is a party! I was talking about at your house though! :)
My car tells me it is 106 degrees outside. Wow. I mean wow.
@saroy any good party should include fire trucks.
nothing is quite as unnerving as when the friends that you eat lunch with leave the company.
reminder: today is not monday.
@nokia it's flickr, not flicker.  No "e".
crossed a threshold today... bought a book on Kindle that I was already reading in paperback. I wanted to have it with me all the time...
I didn't set my alarm today and woke up on my own, but couldn't get out of bed until I turned on NPR news. happy retirement Liane Hansen!
spent the afternoon at the pool with all the divorced old ladies in my neighborhood... reading, napping, picnicking... ahh...
deciding between studying, home improvement, and doing nothing this weekend. so far, doing nothing is winning.
this does not make me calm. this makes me stress out. 
subway sandwich rookie was over eager with the meatballs. this made my sandwich soggy and my belly full. oh my. nap time.
@harperben your brother played a great show last night!
Stalking my favorite small band tonight. Harper Blynn FTW!
@yayblynn see you there!  glad that this time you will have jblynn with you with his robotic appendix!
strange that American Idol has slanted so obviously towards a single audience.
called ATT because someone was SMS spamming me incomprehensible garbage. they checked and it was actually a guy who is dumb at texting.
I'm wearing shorts at work! I'm wearing shorts at work! It's our picnic day, but still... first time since I was a lifeguard!
seriously reluctant to start my Tuesday.
When you go to concerts for bands that cut a CD you liked in 1993 everyone looks OLD
I used to accept friend request on fb using the simple rule: do I know this person? need to add: would I speak to this person if I saw them?
feeling nostalgic about my 25 year old HVAC an old man is going to take to the dump tomorrow. running it all night nonstop as a tribute.
@_christina_ @mrmanmo take kent with you!
facebook has me in the habit of  not signing messages. weird.
bachelor lunch: chili quesadillas. pretty sure you can serve anything over tortillas and cheese and it is good.
I had already put my sweatshirts away, and now I have to dig one out for the day... but I don't mind the cool weather for now...
Drinking a Pepsi because Panera gave it to me for free and I have to wonder - why is this a product? It is terrible. #cokerules
@_christina_ thanks for adding "paranoid use of paper towel to exit bathroom" to my list of neuroses.
my AC guy has been sick this week and postponed my install until Saturday. =( I was all excited about getting it done tomorrow.
I find talking and engaging people to make sure they understand things exhausting after 1 hour. how do teachers do it?
@artemis1979 you type it on IM and I will read it to them.
@artemis1979 you should just do it on a conference call with me, and I can repeat to the astronauts anything you say.
got an 88 on my midterm despite being a zombie. woot!
I need a jolt. Going into a midterm exam but I'm a zombie.
@unclebp and seriously... $1.00 per page more for sending "out of state"? was it going by carrier pigeon?
@unclebp it was $2.50 a page!!!
I needed to send a fax yesterday from Kinko's but did not because they charge for long distance. Seriously, what is long distance?!?
@saroy @_christina_ we work from home so much I no longer think it is weird to send or receive email at any time...
@_christina_ my work computer takes an hour to boot up. seriously. I have had to cancel meeting because of a reboot.
when you are waiting around at times when no one is posting anything funny on twitter...
it was an extremely long week. just in time for a long weekend filled with relaxing fun.
my new AC guy talks so much that by the end of the call, I seriously zone out and I have no idea what he's saying.
once again, comcast had my line split with my neighbors. grr! then when they mixed up the rat's nest, they disconnected me... #comcastfail
I have been looking forward to Survivor all week and today my cable and internet decide to die. #comcastfail
how awesome is it that I have red and grey hair in my beard? way awesome. reason enough to keep the goatee.
all your base. your base. your base. all your base are belong to us.
I'm not sure if paper towels are acceptable alternatives to coffee filters, but you gotta do what you gotta do.
I think I am getting carpal tunnel syndrome. It's minor, but it's definitely a nagging annoyance.
@_christina_ btw, providing a link on your blog to nyt does not count against my 25 articles/month. it's direct online reading only...
I have zero patience today & nothing is working = annoyed.
perfect cinco party: margaritas and Glee.
had nachos for lunch in celebration of... the 5th of May... now I want a margarita real bad.
what has changed in my life that suddenly I really appreciate 50 and 60 degree days in the spring? sigh.
strange to me that nyt is still correcting information that I read correctly on twitter like two days ago. come on people.
this giant mutant angry bee somehow got trapped inside and tried to kill me while I did my laundry today. so I tried to kill him right back.
@unclebp cabinet falling... ug. must have been LOUD.
Bush: "Well, I loosened it."
I have been thirsty and sleepy all weekend.
Toy Story 3 is the saddest movie ever made. I definitely had a few choice words for Andy at the end.
watched the movie "doubt" a second time. learned nothing about doubt. learned only about damaged people constrained by an institution.
also, anyone know why they call the mall "The Mal"? I assume it is in tribute to Firefly and @NathanFillion #theroyalwedding
anyone know why William has no ring? I assume it's because Kate is now his property and he can't be owned!
this just in, NASA to shoot a rocket into space in honor of the royal wedding. thanks, NASA! 
ok, I need a nap now.
@saroy @photine choir people FTW!!!
go John Rutter go!
@saroy queen's hat fail.
@_christina_ so awesome!!
really sleepy today. starting to get concerned about my ability to get up for the royal wedding tv coverage tomorrow.
tornadoes are bad, but this after storm weather this spring has been AWESOME!
oh no. just added pandora to my roku and it is awesome. worried I might have to buy the upgrade.
I had 29.5 hours of meetings on my schedule this week.
the cable company should realize that if I'm recording it that they do not need to interrupt it with weather alerts. tv channels are stupid.
got to be on ”the list” thanks to @JohnnyGrubb who is the best bluegrass bassist you have ever heard of. Times a t 
thank goodness for helpful people. against a wall of unhelpfulness finally got a small break today.
rd: I'll just enter and wave my arms wildly if it comes to that
me: get a phone.
I don't respond to arm waving. only txts.
I was a pee-on, but naturally I thought I was in control of everything in the world and this must be my fault. I almost had a heart attack.
this one time I worked at PoFolks and they ran out of fried chicken, sweet tea, and silverware at the same time.
@windowsphone I want a shirt!
the sad minutes when you sit on a conference call hoping that the person that didn't respond to your invite will miraculously appear.
seriously reading this stuff for class makes my eyes melt and my brain explode. it's not even difficult, it's just that dry and obtuse.
vmail: "whatcha doing? why arentcha answering your phone" google transcribes "Switzerland might change your phone". hey @google, that's bad.
*perfect* weather day.
Eric and Tammi Taylor are my best (imaginary) friends. Just sayin.
it says something about me that my phone has no data plan, but is on wifi 22 hours a day through wifi @ 1.work 2.home 3.church.
@andrewsantelli stop taking my name in vain. it's not easy being green.
for the second time today, a coworker came by to say "see you on facebook" - the new corporate lingo for "I'm leaving forever."
it is so nice that I am a point in life that if I want to eat eggo waffles at midnight no one complains in the slightest.
45 minutes cleaning the study. cleared out the pile between the door and the desk. hmm... how does this happen?!?
the 25th anniversary Les Mis CD is not nearly my favorite. luckily I can't hear it over my own singing most of the time.
@baucs @_christina_ aparently not that great at keeping secrets afterall...
@saroy but the way Jeff Probst got in the head of the two people arguing was masterful. it was pure genius. seriously.
@saroy it is strange because no one is playing the game at all. but that will change after top 6... maybe. otherwise boston rob will win...
my amazon delivery is currently with a creepy company called lasership. laser ship? seriously? who does that?
I have always liked Jeff Probst but tonight I realized he's amazing. he totally resolved a tribe dispute by listening carefully! mad props.
what? nutella and cheez-its?!? yuuummnomnomnom-eenomeenomnom-nom
let other rise to take our place until the earth is free.
let us die facing our foe, make them bleed while we can. make them pay through the nose. make them pay for every man.
I hate realizing that I am most outraged and anxious about things on days when I have a macchiato. damn you chocolate deliciousness!
as @kennysnow informed me -today is the day. "April 19, 2011. At 20:11 Skynet goes online."
did I mention how devastated I am that the manager of the subway I go to moved to a new location? really really disappointing.
@saroy PMP certification
vegging out in front of tv and completing my class homework are currently occupying the same time spot. something's gotta give.
lazy day!!!
some people shouldn't be allowed to use power tools. I am one of those people #badathomeimprovement #alwaysdoitwrongthefirsttime
Yep. That's a winner.
In a mostly empty theater it is not ok to walk in and sit directly in front of me. Yes you - big haired lady!
Why is it whenever I want to see a good movie I have to go by myself? We will see if that holds true for "win, win"
my googling skillz are broken. I can't find the mcdonalds double cheeseburger commercial with mary lou retton. critical procrastination!
It has been so long since I have even thought of the country called USSR I momentarily forgot the acronym…
you never know how tired you are until - instead of watching tv - you try to study. unrelated - hanging new pictures makes me hate old ones.
the willys by perimeter mall has 100s since 2007... wow! 
@_christina_ haha.
wfh advantage: blasting les mis on the home stereo.
@andrewsantelli cool - we should go! how does May look for you? =)
dang it. seriously everone I know has been to machu picchu besides me.
2 days of travel related insomnia just hit me all at once.  really sleepy and it feels great.
@saroy at the moment a couple of days to actually do things at my house seems really appealing to me.
why does my HOA send  letters? thank you for this  stupid out of date info if only we had some way of transmitting electronic data instantly
emergency!  I am about to hit my vacation max. must take vacation in the next 30 days or else lose vacation days... stacation here I come.
someone has a case of the mondays. wait, is it too early to say that?
@andrewsantelli this is one of those issues I can see both sides of.  boy scouts don't let girls join either.
@andrewsantelli bathrooms and locker rooms are generally gender specific
added new (small) panamanian eagle carving to mantle by rearranging trinkets. dropped 4 of my favorite souvenirs. shockingly, all cast iron.
alas. can't sleep. some sort of bizarre jet lag. nothing happening on facebook and toy story 3 was too depressing for me to watch.
the responsible thing to do would be to go to bed now.
there is  nothing in "Office Space" that is NOT classic.
@benpettit that's what I meant by renting a movie online. netflix, amazon. there's nada I wanna watch.
I hate it when the pizza is hot and there is no movie worth renting online.
put a bed sheet over the window. ten degrees cooler in the study. ordered new curtains on amazon immediately.
home. boxers. golf on tv.
I feel the need for a chemical bath.
miracle of engineering people, come on.
posted video of panama canal. no one commented.
@yoyoel aw.  that is a seriously displeased face. don't worry, bolt bus aside, NY will be fabulous as always.
just realized that since getting my new passport two years ago, I have not used it for non-work related travel. this must be corrected.
I want a scientific study to understand what dies inside a person as they age that prevents them from sleeping in when they have a chance...
@vernonwalker drive away from there!! internet is life.
@yoyoel we definitely need to test this theory.
I have always wanted to get a popcorn bucket filled with diet coke. that seems intriguing. and miraculously... still zero calories!
@vernonwalker good points, but the defense to me is just mind boggling.
