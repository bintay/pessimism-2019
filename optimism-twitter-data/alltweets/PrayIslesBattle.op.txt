@SNLeTellier Hey Sebastien! Would love to connect man and talk about your artists!
Tornado touched down about an hour away from me in Dallas. Pretty epic. #twister #Dallas #nature… 
@StapeNewsday let's start a blog and make mega ad/revenue talking out our ace. Buff 1st to Isles A5. Team speaking to Tortarella. S10 #LOL
@TomLiodice it's fun trolling through @katemurray516 on Twitter and seeing the 98% of hate comments headed her way over #Isles
@StapeNewsday all good sir! No harm. And agreed, yet I'm still on it daily, SMH... Not happy but still optimistic about the staff decision.
@StapeNewsday speaking to the BS tease by hockeybuzz and the fans not aware of your article or Snows updates. Credible sources my ass. TY!!
@stapenewsday Exactly why I was asking for some light to be shed… this article was posted today. Not the tease we want to hear…
Can you comment on this @StapeNewsday - I'm sure plenty of fans are confused by @Eklund …as per usual #Isles 
That just made me tickle.... Thinking of Eichel setting up Nelson #Isles

@drosennhl did it to #isles last round and rangers attack is not as dangerous. They aren't forechecking hard enough IMHO
@myregularface making up for all the non calls in the #islesvscaps series
Hey @katemurray516 on behalf of #islesnation  I'd like to welcome you to Twitter. Now kindly F*** off! TY #isles

Come on man.. Diehard fans are gonna have emotions running wild. You threw some gas on the fire. Collateral damage 
Lmao. This is great haha #isles #wishlist 
@BigRedDiva you mean 8 games in a series? Right @NBCNews lol #isles #jokes
Imitating @Real_ESPNLeBrun shame on you.... And x100 for trying to pull something of this magnitude on #islesnation 
How many times were we up 2-0 or 3-0 this season and still lost? Including a 3-1 lead in game 2? Come on dude... 
@13Mike31 @mirtle considering how much he despises Capuano, I'm thinking he'd take the job just to spite him lol #Isles
@_legohead_ from afar yes, looking at the franchise makeup and the reasons behind each teams exit, not even close
The hockey gods would be repaying #Isles fans everywhere for years of Shitty coaches and piss poor talent management 
@mirtle @13Mike31 I'll gladly take his "sucking" in Brooklyn lol #Isles
It's not that shocking. Babcock is by far above and beyond what Capuano is capable of as a coach. #Isles 
@cal_dehaan I like most of #IslesTwitter enjoyed the sarcasm haha. Get strong this summer kid!! Wanna see 30+ points with Hammer next year!

@erincolton aren't you shamelessly getting followers by shamelessly knocking on roger? Lol @RogerWBAB @RogerandJP @JPWBAB
@SeanCaps8 congrats bud. You guys earned it in that game. Beat the crap out of the Rags. Next year is gonna be crazy
And maybe a coach who knows how to change and adapt his strategy as his opponent does... #Isles #SorryCappy #Gottago
Just think... This young team has now felt the sting of losing a game 7. Watch them come out w/a new fire &amp; maturity next ssn #Isles #deadly
@islesblogger <PENSIVE FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Seeing this one really cuts deep.... Love this team. Going to miss the coliseum. But just wait till next year #Isles

Isles fans.... 
@BigRedDiva that makes two of us... #sadDallasLiving <TIRED FACE>
@alex_prewitt @Riz2525 he should passionately S My D
@DFriedmanOnNYI and you know he's playing hurt
@DFriedmanOnNYI  zero forecheck on his line. No secondary support so even though two of his shots tricked Holtby, no one to force play
@DFriedmanOnNYI I actually thought he was one of the stronger #isles last night. Drove some play into the ozone. Had a few shot attempts
@NumberBradleyF it's not even a joke. Think about how dominant they were at times. ZERO credit to Capuano. Just grit, forecheck and skill
Capuano coached this team out of the playoffs ruining what couldve been an even more dominant season. Think how far we'd go w/Babcock #Isles
If Capuano isn't fired after this season, I will delete this account and never attend or watch another #Isles game.
@RJinVegas @ReaganKingIsles what about $100 on the 12th? Sign me up
Nite nite #latenight #postshower #selfie #sleep #Dallas 
@barstoolsports that is a damn good question......
The game is NOT over and they just toss 2/3 of our most complete line out for what? Being aggressive?  Non-calls all over the ice. bs #NHL
I'm sorry but I think this officiating is just as bad as the coaching
Didn't think so.... #isles #canyouhearus #NHL
The only thing loud in that building is the damn horn. And it's just annoying. Does the Coliseum need a horn to start chants? #Isles #Caps

Dylan Strome"
It's ok #isles fans. My buddy Scott isn't watching the game tonight. That's usually a good sign for the team. He has no luck as a fan
Yet everyone is praising how well Straiter is playing.....  
@barstoolsports as he rightfully should. I actually agree with Kanye... O shit
@barstoolsports hahaha
@costello_barry @barstoolsports with the history my family has had with this team.. I'd take my Gpa who worked with trotts n Nystrom #isles
@costello_barry @barstoolsports right? I'd give anything lol. Including my tax return for a ticket. My family wouldn't mind seeming me lol
@HamonicsEgo3 he's been a leader on the ice. Never gives up on a play
@SeanCaps8 @MaciejM22 @Shannon_Hogan @tom_wilso I thought so lol
@barstoolsports this would mean so much. I'd have to fly back up from Dallas but would in a heartbeat. My dad, bro and uncle are all going

@DanDanNoodles78 they are gonna pull the trigger. I'm betting my balls on it! POO-BEAR!


Dubby dubby dubby, can't you see....
Wasn't expecting the response but appreciate the diligence! 
@BillFoleyHockey you are very welcome my friend! Looking forward to the future success of your franchise #VegasThunder #VegasOutlaws #NHL
#dbzsquad 
FAV FOR WACKA FLOCKA 
@WFAN660 @DFriedmanOnNYI lol
Agreed 
@BillFoleyHockey good luck bill. I'll gladly be apart of it. More hockey and business understanding then most the #NHL
#Isles will come out strong n shove the #Caps "Swagger" right down their throats. Cant wait to silence that library of a crowd #Isles #NHL
@StapeNewsday what about Dehaans status? He was just god awful last night in his own zone. I counted 5 giveaways w/ample opp to move puck
@StapeNewsday not going to happen but would like to see Pulock take that spot. Righty shot. Just a bomb... Pair with hickey.
@BattleLevel @IslesFan_Ben @KevinRogers98 @MayHockeyCSN I'm sure we could get this unprofessional dbag
@BattleLevel @IslesFan_Ben @KevinRogers98 @MayHockeyCSN if a redneck #caps fan can twist a story to play #isles fans as classless....
@BattleLevel @IslesFan_Ben @KevinRogers98 @MayHockeyCSN we should instead right an open letter to have him publicly apologize for that shit
@BattleLevel @IslesFan_Ben @KevinRogers98 @MayHockeyCSN maybe I'll fly up to Washington for tomorrow's game. Anyone down?
@BattleLevel no, May. Just notifying you guys of my thoughts  @IslesFan_Ben @KevinRogers98 @MayHockeyCSN

3 goals, same spot and another broken stick. That changes everything #isles
@applesiderr @MattSaidman we #Isles fans are classy, respectful gents. Could never hit a girl. Hence why no #caps fan has been beaten up <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@MattSaidman @applesiderr she must be slapped... Openhanded.... With a feather

@francistancis @chrishowrad @nhllsles hahaha I want in. This is tough. But gotta go with Chris!
@IslesFansUnite @Sbeige clearly a reliable source.....
@Sbeige @NHL did you see the guy who made that claim that the Washington post picked up? Total bs and clearly looking to provoke.
Ovi on golfing after losing series: "We lose... Now I try to put hole-in-one. I still score goals, just much smaller net. No goalie. I Like"
Ovi is gonna talk his team right out on to the ladies tees #Isles
I think it's every #Caps personnel's objective to downplay the #isles and their fans in this series. Not smart #NoNo 
@sbeige well said. I reached out to #Caps fan who was feat. w/me in the Playoff moment video from @NHL - Passion, Class and respect #Isles

@BigRedDiva @kGrosebud you're goin? I'll be out there filming and might go to the game
@nyifancentral I'd say he goes for just about 6mill per avg. Leddy is 8 years younger and had FA years eaten up. Tougher deal to make
Not sure whether to bash #CBJ or #LeafsNation for the Horton/Clarkson swap..... #islestwitter #pointless #NHLTradeDeadline

@ScoutingTheRefs what's their record for the isles?

@kafren224 @blurrybluesmoke he died
@IslesWild @islesfan84 hahaha exactly. Pitt, Caps, Devs, Flyers, Rags.... It's inevitable
@IslesWild @islesfan84 that's where to not in this teams makeup. They don't do rentals. The Vanek experiment was a failure and same w/Smith
@IslesWild @islesfan84 Stewart is another interesting case and the Isles have great relations with Buffalo
@IslesWild @islesfan84 and yes the vet presence. Similar to how Boston rose him to the finals.
@IslesWild @islesfan84 Jagr with JT and KO? It would be too easy. His board play opens space, he can pass, control puck and score
@IslesWild @islesfan84 @bookerT2116 same. He's a workhorse. Plays with grit and passion ever since that Pitt series
@IslesWild @islesfan84 well now that we have Strait we should be set <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@IslesWild I actually would consider reinhart for Kane but that's it
@IslesWild @islesfan84 personally I'd love Jagr on the too line. But he's not built for speed game. Although neither is Lee. He does shoot
@IslesWild @islesfan84 that's this team for us though. It'll be interesting to see if a move is made, that's for sure...
@DBZSquad_ @YaNamekPiccolo English translation?
@IslesWild no doubt the kid has talent but it's  too much risk.
@STLMelisaNicole I might be packaged with it haha
@STLMelisaNicole cant this just for once be an isles shirt <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@islesfan84 @IslesWild we all think about Berard. But this is 2015. Medical tech is much more advanced. And he didn't take stick to the eye
@YahooSportsNHL so pretty much the entire Sabres roster
@IslesWild bro I've thought the same but this kid is a headcase. And we'd have to give too much. Plus he is clearly injured.
@IslesWild I deem you better take those words back lol

Maybe time to package Bailey and a 3rd for the wiley vet. Jagr would look damn good next to JT and I'm betting would help ease the pressure
If I was Snow I would find a way to bring over Jagr. The playoff experience alone is worth it. He wants to play. He wants to Win. #Isles
@NHLonNBCSports @NHL the kid played a great game!
Not a Yankee fan by any means, but what they are doing for that cops family is nothing short of beautiful. #selfless #hope #family

@joshbarely if @ehornick took you on as an intern it would be an extreme honor. Well said.
Taking bets on how long before I pass out from hanging upside down on this inversion table 
@joshbarely you are on your game with these numbers lol. Someone call @ehornick and tell him he has an intern!
@stlmelisanicole @robertjhudson People are greedy.
@stlmelisanicole Actually he's the sweetest most caring guy out there. Them good ole homegrown Manitoba, WPG kids lol
@isleswild @brsilk86 bang bang. #officepop
@joshbarely @isleswild ok ok ok we get it lol Bailey is useless. But he's an Islander. Unlike Brian Strait
@stlmelisanicole Hamonic's Middle name is "Hammer". Guess why lol :P
@stlmelisanicole See you in June. And your team will Meet Travis Hamonic and Johnny Fucking Boychuck
I was showering… what happened to Howard?
@stlmelisanicole the beautiful woman of hockey. Of course. And I need someone to chirp at when the isles beat the blues in the Cup finals!
@isleswild I'll supply the Gun. JT and KO are mature enough that they can snap their own funks
Who am I kidding Half of #IslesTwitter wasn't around when we had Osgood lol… #FeelingOld #Isles
Its ok, its ok. Now we get to play Miracle Hockey
@palffynyi16 @joshbarely in fact… if this team could connect on one-timers… man it be scary.
@palffynyi16 @joshbarely if only he had some hands.
@palffynyi16 @joshbarely Now I disagree. He is always in on the hit but you can tell he holds up ALOT more then most guys that play that way
@joshbarely @palffynyi16 in other news… I picked up Nabby on fantasy tonight…. immediately regretting it
@palffynyi16 @joshbarely ooooo man how can you not be a Martin fan? He's going to be one of the few surviving NHL enforcers. and Sydney….
@palffynyi16 @joshbarely Hey! He's not Brian Strait HAHA OK Boys… GAMETIME! LGI
@joshbarely @palffynyi16 lol I'm not disagreeing. I think its time to shit or get of the pot too.
3 years ago they saw different potentials. This team also signed Yashin and DP to BS contracts and gave away Chara n 3 other Hall of Famers
@joshbarely @palffynyi16 Both players are inconsistent. The difference is Comeau Grinds the game out more then Bailey does n its paying off
@joshbarely @palffynyi16 when did this turn into an argument? All of #IslesNation has seen the way bailey is capable of playing.
@palffynyi16 @joshbarely Are we going to compare Brock Nelson with Rhett Rakshani next?
@palffynyi16 @joshbarely Not overrating him at all. Stating the facts. they are two completely different players.
@joshbarely @palffynyi16 he also has finally seemed to master the COZO
@joshbarely Wonder is his father was a drill Sgt
@mirandowjm18 I hope that wasn't sarcasm. I would take Moulson back in a second. His character, his bond w/JT n the team. He is an Islander
I want the JT from 2012 back…. and Moulson…. Please… Santa PLEEASEE
Vintage Capuano (circa 2010) would totally beat 2014 Capuano in a hotdog eating contest
Here's the infamous 5-0 shutout lol
@joshbarely He still hasnt let go of his Lunch money from the 3rd grade
Geezzzz Been a while since I've seen Vintage Isles highlights like this… lol
@palffynyi16 @joshbarely Terrible comparison. And Comeau is a direct product of Malkin + going to dirty areas. Bailey is a possession player
@jrossiello @nyislesnation I'll be at the game tuesday.. Festivities commence!
@joshbarely Well the next outing was his retribution… but you know deep down he hates Cappy. #whodoesnt
“@GwenIsles: “@IslandersPB: NBC Sports could add Isles games to broadcast schedule 
@chrishowrad but an ugly girl with hot girl photos on instagram…. #Breaktheinternet
@_brockkkk29 and if they win?
Long travel day from Dallas.. was up at 3am… But home just in time for the pre-game AND PIZZA!!!!! LETS GO ISLANDERS!
So I'm thinking tonights matchup is all about Babcock vs Crapuano. Who remembers the 5-0 shutout win a couple years ago? #Isles
Cal Clutterbuck has some swaggalicious hair join on tonight. No Homo… We have a pretty damn good looking team. #Isles
Finished up work and my boss surprises me with these. Couldn't be more thankful! Insane seats! Flight to NY in the AM 
Anyone have an extra ticket to Saturday's #Isles game? I'm back in NY for the holidays! My company comes with two free Beers and Food!
NEED HELP! Who should I start tonight. Lack or Backstrom????? #Fantasyhockey #fantasyexpert #Fantasyhelp
@bigreddiva you should just have the game playing in the background. Lesson #1 - Battle Level and the 2 man forecheck weak-side


[after a pause] …
I mustache you a question! But I shall shave it for later... 
Late to the party but what a game!! Huge huge character win. Something to build off of and gain renewed confidence for sure! #Isles #Depth
@JRossiello @NYIslesNation I'll be back the 19th for two weeks so defimitely
@JRossiello @NYIslesNation if I was back on LI Id totally join you and by the beers
@Riz2525 did you crosscheck him in the throat?
@Left_Wing_Lock my fantasy team is banking on him staying that way tonight! Esp after just trading Miller
@JRossiello @IslesBlog I want one!
@Chrishowrad when I lived in the city I came back to LI during Santacon.... Stupidest thing on earth
@MeganStael gamer tag?
Also picked up Gaborik but I may let him go soon of the Kings offense doesn't pickup. Great playoff team but can't grind out 82+ like that
My fantasy lineup now has Tavares, Parise, Backstrom, Ovi, Nelson and Vrbata up front... And i was already in 1st without the first 3
@MeganStael @_Hornqvist young guns?
@_Hornqvist @MeganStael gonna need to test my skills against you kids
@LeddyOrNot is that Crosbys face? Or did you steal that from Strait's lunch box?
@JTsHelmetHair @russianmachine @Allie____ "Yeaaa. I had the last cupcake. Hehe"
Sidney Crosby looks like he just came from fat camp
@Chrishowrad penguins are known to attack in packs... Just tip one over and they'll all fall down
@Chrishowrad see what happens when you joke! An innocent little boy just lost his dream
@Chrishowrad @NYIslanders well I thought it was gonna be a good day. Then I stubbed my toe while uncovering the truth.... #cruel #goodone
@kupkrazy We were that team before we played STL a last weekend
Remember remember, the 5th of November. The last time @bookerT2116 scored. He's been ok since then anyway. But tonight we could use a GWG.
@SP19hockey @Shannon_Hogan also send me some sweet lovin. #justsayin #ifitworksitworks
#Isles #IslesTwitter #islesnation #majorleague #moviequotes 
@DFriedmanOnNYI tell that to the kid who said he was playin like a rook. No1 gets that highlight reel plays aren't what make a franchise C
#IslesTwitter #islesnation 
I think Strait has blackmail on someone on #Isles front office. Maybe he caught Cappy putting some Weight on Garths Wang?
@DFriedmanOnNYI Bold strategy Cotton! Let's see if it works out for em.
Oh hey #islesnation lol
@NYIslesNation butch has alsheimers and repeats the same shit every game
@TheIslandSheik Dear Mr. Brian Strait,
Go DIAF. Sincerely, #islesnation
@Chrishowrad me with kiddo. Sad day
@nyyankee04 that would be a Christmas  miracle
@_nikobae peewee career lol
@most_VALuable_ both off his ass
Why not have Grabovski center the 4th line? Put grabs back with 51-15 and Strome on the always reliable kid line again. Thoughts? #isles
So what do you think #islesnation - Think they have learned from the last two games? I mean.. We still have strait. But we also have Boulton
@BCISLEMAN @nyifancentral amen
Was waiting for this one to finally happen LAWLZ #waivestrait #isleisfittoys 
@phavrephan Not going to happen.
@phavrephan Is this what is going through #IslesTwitter these days?
@phavrephan wait… what?!?
@PhavrePhan @NYIslesNation yes Boychuck and Hamonic are out, but team needs to understand how to adjust play accordingly. #notevenclosecoach
@PhavrePhan @NYIslesNation my pee-wee coaching career was 10-0. And we only let up 5 goals. I think I'm more qualified then Crapuano
@_KuIemin if go 37<PISTOL> <HOCHO>30
Kyle is pissed
Of course the refs have to make sure Minny gets some "karma". Bullshit but it happens. Play your game boys. We got this. #isles
This looks familiar..... #dejavu
It's a Brockleddy. Sounds like a vegetable or ninja turtles character #Ises #nicknames
@drive4fiveNYI el Shino
#Isles
Where is Halakingjay?? I was in the gym
Pulock should replace Strait IMHO
Does anyone even live in Vegas? Other then pit crews, showman and strippers?
@Riz2525 was gonna ask where you got it. So cool
@Riz2525 that's awesome!!!
Tough move by #Sens to fire MacLean. There are going to go through an interesting transition period I think. Maybe they'll take back Yashin
Welp we have learned you cannot win them all. Need to collect. Plenty of time to rest and get some guys healthy and most of all. Lose strait
Another goal with strait not seeing his man..... Example number #GTFO
@giaaalynnn I remember high school lol… I had a gf was was afraid to tell me she gave her ex a BJ in the past. O to be young and innocent
The length of Kulemin's Stick is the reason Hickey was able to tip that puck out of the zone
Quick whistles for Broduer ay?
@giaaalynnn o_0
I swear if Strait is not waived soon I will lose my shit…
All the action has worn this lil lady out. She's the best to watch games with. #Isles 
Thats the kind of goal the #isles needed. Gritty, Crashing the Net. Bobby Ny Approves! Isles up 4-3
I do not like the hesitations on shots. I do not like the Passes blocked. I do not like the neutral zone jam. I do not like them Sam I am
Maybe if #islestwitter starts showing some positive encouragement for Strait, he'll feel better about himself and improve.... Nahhhhh
Halak + Mockingjay = Halakingjay
@IslesBlog he's never had an issue with rebound control. Something #isles fans have never seen
@_SC87 not as much as Ernhoff
Halak should be the Mockingjay lol
@_hornqvist suck on that one hard.
@ehornick you let howie beat you to the punch!!!
@Shannon_Hogan and @grabs40 wanted to make sure you were ok to with that one
I guess he finally sniffed it out. @grabs40 welcome back ha gremlin! #isles
This is just sexy now
@Shannon_Hogan aww Shannon! #noshame @strome18 scored that just for you.
Love this kid! @strome18 #Isles 2-0 
From super Mario to the baby face. He's sniffing a goal 
Grabner and those quick feet on the PK are gonna do great thing for the #isles when guarding those point shots
The Danish Prince strikes again! #ThatsSoDanish #isles #matinee #hockey
And what I am referring to has nothing to do with sex or my relationship, both of which I am thankful for. #ijusthatebitches
I realllly hate bitches... And I don't hate anyone... But bitches with no accountability... Thank you too all the amazing woman out there
@miakhalifa @bangbros Classy gent that pup is. Turning away while the sexiness changes
@JTsHelmetHair @BDGallof @TheNLKing @hockeybuzz more to come............. <SKULL>
@BDGallof well top forwards are available, but isles don't need to shop. 1st line just needs to start clicking
@NYI_World @_nikobae no one will pick up baileys contract. Eberle is garbage. Team needs depth. 4 regs out last night. No need to make trade
People talk about it being a long season. The #Isles depth took care of business last night. So Im ok with that 
@miakhalifa @wowidk321 Id be glad to hop on board
Can't get much closer then that. First Place Baby! Halak with an #Isles record
Absolutely terrible shift by #Isles KO way too lethargic there
Chiasson was trying to scoop up deHaans balls there
@NYIslesPride please send in photo of rules and we can all play next game
And Halak with a bigger save them you might think there. Slows play down. Settles momentum shift. Steady as she goes. No rebounds #Isles
What a look by @thomas_hickey14 to @zeeker11 - heads up play!! #Isles
Great control along the boards by kid line. Feet moving. Gotta start putting pucks at a detains pads. Get him moving a bit more
Would've loved JT to powerskate that in a little deeper and 5-hole it
Howie mentioning the #Pens lost almost dooms us as bad as @91Butch mentioning a shutout streak right before it's broken. #isles
Man I forgot how quick Grabner was
@islesfansunite @DFriedmanOnNYI they never play in a box. They play to allow passes along perimeters and nothing through the middle....
Well it is after all Alfredo night in Ottawa. Wouldnt be surprised if the Canadian refs skewed the game a bit in the #Sens favor over #Isles
Anddddd another one #islestwitter @MrKnobles needs to learn to tweet for himself lol 
@MrKnobles is still trying to figure out Twitter. But he wanted me to give all you a message #IslesTwitter 
@Riz2525 @StapeNewsday he should go chill with @Shannon_Hogan and @sarahjeanmaher who are probably a blast!
@DFriedmanOnNYI I don't blame you
@DFriedmanOnNYI is trying to get it in @sarahjeanmaher
@Shannon_Hogan @sarahjeanmaher thank you indeed. #beautifulwomanofIslesHockey
@sarahjeanmaher @IslesArmy @NYIslanders yumm
@NYJayT91 let's see the two of them get it on. She should motorboat Shannon
@_nikobae Id give it to her @sarahjeanmaher

maybe we'll get there before...        ( •_•)&gt;⌐■-■

Im just saying my pregame report specifically referred to Hoffman as the sneaky player to watch out for tonight #isles #scoutingreport #Sens
@BuzzFeedEnt @BuzzFeed @islestopshelf awesomeeeeee
@emergencygiass @420humor and then have nightmares for a week
Who hasn't read tonight's #Isles Pre-game report? Mine is the obvious resource for your fix. Right @ehornick ;) 
@ianalittle yes please
@eliselevasseur givin geeky a whole new meaning
@NYIslesNation good. Then he can stay there
@RichDeKorte @91Tavares @PR_NHL @ESPNStatsInfo that's all the record is?
@lexii_gee they were a step off there game tonight but stuck with it. JT was tired as hell on that play, muscled it out. Great 2 pts.
Not feelin good about the shot Okposo took off his foot..... #isles
@lexii_gee how's the game looking from your perspective
@lexii_gee ok ok that made me like you a little bit
Interesting little transaction by #Isles today. Garth Snow restocking those draft picks
@lexii_gee wear that rags jersey and it will be burned…. #sorrynotsorry
@sp19hockey also without brouwer and green
@smokersupply @weedcode bullshit
@nyifancentral Not gonna lie The Coliseum was pretty packed last night for a Monday game. Id say 85% filled
@left_wing_lock Reto Berra?
@leddytoboychuk If i go I'm in
@KatiaVillalba if you like iced tea, try monster rehab! A fraction of the sugar redbull has.
@tazman19 #isles need to come out firing again. Can't be complacent with this news.

@BigRedDiva we gotta catch up then when I come back again around Xmas!
Love getting to the #isles game with family! 
He's such a good cuddles. @mattymarts17 #isles #cuddling 
@BigRedDiva you at the game tonight?
The "stud" del zotto sits in the box. Can't get over his pathetic attempt to use a pornstar as a dating service. #isles
#mondaynighthockey and the crowd is packed and into it!!! Big PK #isles
Me and @islestopshelf wanna meet up with #islestwitter tonight!!! If you are at the game let us know!!!! #shotshotshots #isles
Back on Li and had to come to tonight's game! @mattymarts17 is getting back his fighting groov!!!! #isles
@Russia305 lol
This array of tweets pretty much sums up last night for #Isles @Hornyqvist LAWLZ 
That's what you fucking get Downie! Go suck Crosby off when he comes crying into the locker room! Let's go #isles
Downie is a gutless Bitch! Let's take advantage
@HDumpty39 always good to see you talkin #Isles hockey. Missin you out there everyday. Move down to Dallas. Let's get a league going!
Tarasenko scored again. Who does this kid think he is?
@isleskuleaid Strome all day er day
Back on LI for the #Isles vs #Pens game tonight! Lets go boys! Take it to those sideto side waddling fairies!
@_jaymeariellexo you mean #crosbitchwatch***
@thingsandsteph I've been paying $2.50 in dallas for 6months and couldn't be happier!
@hornyqvist Downie couldn't destroy Boychuck's turd. Sit the F**k Down.
@IslesArmy the #pens announcers are the most ignorant pieces of shit in hockey broadcasting. And not just during #isles games
@StapeNewsday #Isles fans w/too much trauma from lengthy history. I disapprove Cappy using "They" and not "We" when referring to team.
@_Strome @Jessica_Reva I giggled
Why yes! I would love to watch the #Isles score 3 goals in 1 minute. Suck it #Pens fans.
@garik16 what are the luck stats you can report on? Interference no call leads to Martin redirect.
Dallas traffic causing me to use data to watch #isles but I'll take that period of hockey anyday!!! #pens being dominated. 2 lucky breaks
@thetonym @rotogrinders "And as so you believe, it shall be done"
@mikemcc21 @nhlexpertpicks #1 Hutton is playing against OTT. #2 Ward has been the reason Carolina has been winning of late #3 your an idiot
@nhlexpertpicks you got my follow, how about an answer lol
@rotogrinders @thetonym I'd say Hutton. Smaller sample size but #Preds are scary team to play and its a lot to ask Ward to beat champs twice
@nhlexpertpicks yes massa
@goaliesnhl Thank you!!!!! Want to put faith in Ward but taking 2 from LA will be tough. Hutton has less sample size but damn r #Preds scary
@rotogrinders @thetonym who should I start tonight? Cam Ward or Carter Hutton?
@nhlqubes who should I start tonight? Cam Ward or Carter Hutton?
@goaliesnhl who should I start tonight? Cam Ward or Carter Hutton?
@left_wing_lock who should I start tonight? Cam Ward or Carter Hutton?

Vote your #Isles #NHLAllStar team! @NHL opened ballots today! Boulton got my 10 votes! #BoultonForASG 
@russostrib Smells like Spirit
Great thing about scoring depth. We can move point per game players to the second line
@THCchicks @alyssabelieves please yes
Need to come out hitting this period. TBL embellishing everything. #Isles heavily out skating them. Wear em down and goals will come
@bklynjoker90 @jyennifaaaa__ Love that place! Old asshole Irish Service.
Last time #Isles faced their old netminder in Tampa was Roloson. Anyone remember Nielsen peppering that slapshot over the glove hand?
Time to get back on track today. Got our old pal #Nabby to face tonight. No let up allowed for the Vet. Tavares opens the scoring! #Isles
Fun fact about @MrKnobles Played in his glory days w/ guys like Scott Gomez and Robbie Scuderi. Great to have him on #islestwitter #family
“@MrKnobles: Fuck Lundqvist's little zen moment before the SO!!!!!! #Rangers @PrayIslesBattle” My uncle has found Twitter!
Me thinks this team is for real. #isles
@islesfansunite Pens won too. Getting there though!
@ehornick 5-0 when @91Butch doesn't talk about himself... Wait, that's not right... #jokes #isles
@ReaganKingIsles Johnson saw more of TB with the Bruins. Also good to keep Halaks with back to back shutouts going
Wow. The power of moms on social media…. this is going to be some damage control
@BigRedDiva I get pissed how they bring their daughters to games and get pissed at me for getting intense.... #passionatefansyndrome

Love that Bruins fans are including boychuck on their list of missing players as if he is still on the roster
@AmalieBenjamin @daboych Boychuck is no longer a bruin lol so that train has left
Last Night: 2 players scored their 1st Goal+2 Scored their 2nd+2 goals by Defenseman+ None were by JT or KO = #ISLES #DEPTH

"The Skinny"  

By Eric Hornick

Game 15

Isles 6, Colorad... 
Listening to the sea of Islanders fans crashing down with chant after chant over the final 60 seconds tonight was music to my ears #Isles
@Riz2525 oh you're good
@RollBlackhawks I can think of a few other things to do
These players are poised, present and punctual #Isles
Strome is about to ascend to a whole other level. #Isles
181 minutes and 11.268 seconds since the isles last let up a goal. Defense wins Championships. #Isles #believe @ehornick
@ehornick is having a field day with some of these stats after tonight. #isles #win
85 degrees yesterday and tonight we have a freeze warming in effect and 10 degree windchill. #Dallas #effinA #missinghome #LongIsland
Hey @ehornick how bout that there Halaks save % #isles
We totally 1 upped the #Avs tonight. #isles #hockey
@stat_sam @RegressedPDO a stat all #Isles fans love to hear

In all seriousness when was the last 1-0 Islanders Game? #isles #BoultonForHart #THATSSODANISH
Capuano is like "give me a raise bitch" #cappysolucky #BoultonForHart #THATSSODANISH 

1. Play
2. Eric
3. Boulton
@Mermousse @IslesEnforcers and 3-0 with boulton in the lineup
“@Mermousse: @IslesEnforcers Also 3-0 with Conacher out of the lineup” rough stat for the kid.
“@GrumpyBahr: 9 out of 10 men prefer a woman who gives blowjobs. The 10th man prefers the other 9 men.” Fun fact
@applesiderr @MattSaidman they got plenty to the net. Again Smith was sharp, very few rebounds.ARI collapsed on D tight in front of the net
“@nyyankee04: Islanders and OSWEGO wins have me like... 
@kevinmcarney no way do not break up the Kid line. They are clutch and provide a great punch. Bailey on top line clutz on 4th. Kul on w/51
@applesiderr @MattSaidman I disagree. PP had some great looks tonight. Smith was sharp, or it would have been 4-0
Well looks looky! Shutout for Halak. Full 60 min effort. Huge win. @91Butch "they are getting dangerous" #Isles #THATSSODANISH

@nyi_world not that tough to admit lol.
Sad truth: I could've made it to #Isles game. Traffic towards Staples Center was just nuts. Happy to enjoy this game for my Hotel room bed
Top to bottom best 60+ minutes of hockey the #Isles have played in a very very very long time. That was playoff hockey. Love this team

Yes in fact Quick is an Elite Goaltender. Case in Point
Second end of Back to back and the #BattleLevel has been as good if not better then any other point this season #NeverGiveUp #Isles #Believe
Easily the best TEAM game they have played in this young season. Let's see what they can do with some open skating space. #Isles #OT
Best thing about the #Isles Goaltending work tonight. NO REBOUNDS
“@islestopshelf: @PrayIslesBattle @Isles_Country 
Tavares owes us a goal and Johnson a fucking steak dinner. Why did he not just fucking throw it on net!
My balls are tingling…….. #PKplease
“@Isles_Country: What religion do I have to convert to so the Isles can kill this penalty?” #IslesReligion
Teams have played hard all game and refs are calling that?!?
Cizikas again WTFFFFFFFFFFF
Great Shift by top line! Gotta take advantage here. Kings 7-0 when giving up 2 or less goals. Lets break them!
@islestopshelf you sound like a friggin nerd
2 kills in a row? Can we say they have finally learned how to defend down a man? Pressure pressure pressure
No words for how much I want to smack Cizikas for that shit in front of the net.

@niykeeheaton meant to tweet this from my other account HA. @ARTastemaker
@niykeeheaton Just had a convo about you at the @billboard #FilmtvConf earlier. Been saying it for a while. Can't wait to see how far you go
@stapenewsday Thank F8cking God
Captain my captain. Now I can have a good night!
@ieshamariee I bet you could get people to pay to bring some to you.
@tomliodice and then proceeds to just stand in the dzone
What #Isles PR failed to mention before tonights game is the Carkner surprised the team in the locker &amp; dubbed Conacher the new traffic cone
@islestopshelf Not if Capuano has anything to say about it!
@monicalsims needed this to give me a smile tonight
@dostthoulove @laurenanderson_ @laurenanderson_  me too
In all honesty. As much as it wasn't a goal, this team and this coach do not deserve the win with the fact they aren't dominating #Isles
Just got to the Hotel in #LA in time to see the tying goal. What the flock? No Perry/Getzlaf and our coach is still a fucking amateur
@BeCoco77 baby's come out your butthole? You might want to get that checked out hun #justsaying
This sign has actually welcomed quite a few people here at the #FilmTVConf @billboardbiz #welcome #icebreaker 
@katiavillalba Form is everything! Keep at it. I'm sure its paying off!
@katiavillalba I used to make most of my income of PT. We are motivators by trade. If you can do it  (Properly) yourself, #Kudos
In LA tonight… closer to the #Isles game but unfortunately won't be watching tonight. At the #FilmTVConf for @Billboardbiz - #IslesTwitter
Traffic on LI sucks but drivers cause wayyyy too much traffic in Dallas....
@Rob_InTheSlot what sort of sauce does he throw during the rest of the week? Is it special sauce? Why sunday? Is that a special sunday?
@JesusTWlTTER @KMartinNYI dude! He noticed!
Tweetable moment of the fucking century. "He's my toy... I'll play with him how I want to!" #whatajoke #chucklesisourcoach #isles
Capuano on Strome: "He had most of his pts last year with Colin McDonald and Matt Martin... I can move him around where we need him." #wtf
Purposely not commenting on the Strome situation. #islesnation #yourgonnahaveabadtime
Just caught a fly out of midair without even looking. I am the One.
“@Riz2525: @PrayIslesBattle  check @thereallisaann tweets” ooooo Michael michael michael you little perv. Treat all woman w/respect. #orelse
@Riz2525 ahh what happened lol
@nyislesnation don't forget MARTIN!
@dougpinelli_65 @leddytogo This is now my Profile Pic. Thanks for making this guy smile after that loss haha #Isles #IslesandBourbon
@riz2525 RIZZZ  I want a shirt… so I can take drunkin selfies during every #Isles game and not feel shame
@58steelcurtain I'm confused. I want the shirt.
So glad we decided to keep Capuano and not bring back Laviolette…. #Saidnooneever
@58steelcurtain Where can i get mine? Size Schmedium
@sydthesinister Coco pebbles!
@joshbarely you nuts? Martin and Conacher become scratches.
@nylslanders You saw Dougie with his hand down Cappy's pants too?!?
That one stings….. Halakkkk
@sydthesinister 0_0
Like that little play boy Strome in the corner forcing the puck to the front of the net. #NeverKnow #PuckLuck #IslesandBourbon
I like it. I like Halakkkkk!!!
Halak does his job
The Elbow went into his face… these NBC broadcasters are fucking retards.
We've been a solid 3rd period team. Lets come out quick and hold down the fort! #LetsGoIslanders
I could watch a game like this all day. Great effort. JT needs to score a goal for himself and loosen up a bit. He seems to be forcing plays
@stapenewsday Looks like the #Isles coach actually showed up in between periods
@islessnipe Yes but if you want to get technical, Wiz actually shot the puck. Wasnt a look first type player
@islessnipe You know exactly what I'm referring to. But thanks for the battle of semantics.
Hickey needs to learn from Jurcina, Streit, AMac and just about every other #Isles offensive minded defensemen. Don't pump fake at the point
Love the back check effort by Strome. Something we didn't see last year from him
Great movement on PP. Finally moving their feet but have to anticipate things better
That Strome line looking good again. Low shots from point. Bodies in front.
Can't help but love Kulemin. Patience all the way. Bad luck for Hammer. Great wrist shot
That 3rd line looks good with boychuck and leddy out there, but martin just can't keep up with the puck moving possession guys
And there it is.... I watched NInja Turtles today. Does that mean I jinxed us? #hertlpower #isles #crap
Halak looks sharp and fought both those two shots off. Let's give him some support
Huge start! Getting caught in their own end a bit but solid 9 minutes so far. Big PK coming up. Let's go boys! #killit #isles
@dfriedmanonnyi Don't flatter yourself Danny boy. He's been solid all season long. Your powers only work on anti-isles shutouts
I have never seen such disconnect between staff and players. I always thought it was “we” and “us.” -Great article @DanDanNoodles78
@chrishowrad @arianagrande Pretty sure they are molded to her head
@dfriedmanonnyi Maybe because Strome played with Martin the last 10 games last season and actually scored some goals. #WhoKnows haha
Waiting for the person who dresses as a Laundry basket full of Cash and calls themselves Thomas Vanek for Halloween.
#FF @islestopshelf @BigRedDiva @KevinRogers98 @mattymarts17 @tazman19 @BattleLevel @IslesRM #goodpeeps

@NotMattyMarts this is what Capuano wakes up to every morning
@tazman19 if this team hires bylsma Id become a penguins fan
#tat halloween last year. Wanna know how I got these scars??? Watching the #isles year after year since '88.

#FireCappy #NoReally #LightHisFuxkingHairOnFire
@Amyleighandrews looking at you almost makes me forget how angry I am over this hockey game
@drive4fiveNYI I still would
Hey butch. I'm sure the message from cappy will be, "guys... Please save my job." @91Butch
@IslandJudgement so hickey is getting double shifted huh?
What's funny is I get pissed over there play in a game in the moment, not in what the other 70 will be like... Yet I'm get shit for it
@JustinRishel giving away picks up the middle in Bridgeport
I guess if I take a shit now, I probably won't miss much
Hickey: check out my no look between the legs pass.... O shit...
@Riz2525 that's light. I throw mine threw the TV
@kupkrazy no. Cap needs to be fired
29 out of 30 teams the league would not allow the time nor space for either of the past two goals.
@nyifancentral Halak had a shit game in WPG but other then that has made the big saves when needed. This trip will speak volumes of team
@nyifancentral didn't say it wasn't a problem. But coaching and D is more the issue then goaltending. Soft goals will happen.
@kupkrazy its 10 games in. Calm yo tits.
@nyifancentral bishop, bob, Rask and Lundy all have similar numbers. All are #1s but will still be sat if for bad starts. Not a big deal now
@nyifancentral he earns it by making the most of his starts moving forward. 10 games in, not 50. Marathon not sprint.

MORE: 
Too many people fretting over goalie situation. Halak is the number 1 but needs to earn it #NuffSaid #isles
@islestopshelf Capuano's hair with call a much needed time out in the 3rd with #isles up 2-1 and they will hold on for the win
@nyislesnation @DonCherryParody had a better reaction. "The Islander Guy" should never do that lol 
@sassafrantz ………… -__-
@aryannahunter :-0
@nyisles10963 ya think? I was gonna go Miller and Gibson. VAN at home. SJS playing MINN Away.

@BigRedDiva I wish that I could be like the cool kids
@IslesNationBC it means he actually thinks people his words have merit enough to spark a controversial conversation
Coaching staff should be taking the blame. Terrible Giveaway by KO but this has been the same rebound routine all game #buckledown
@Ryan_Wombat91 15 actually

Typical Penguins fan.
@ehornick @Shannon_Hogan gotta love the guy. He just loves playing hockey
@BrettCyrgalis yes, quite casual Brett. <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
@MattSaidman what game are you watching? He put him down in the corner &amp; put him to his knees in front of the net #openyoureyeskiddo #isles
@ScottClinco I wouldn't say fortunate. Outside of the 5 min pp and the quick energy burst, the #isles have very much outplayed them
“@MSGNetworks: After a Crosby goal, the @NHLDevils head into the 2nd intermission down 5-3.” This has the potential to b a good night #isles
Grabovski owes Lubo a drink. What a move at the blue line #isles
Love our crowd. #LOUD #Islesnation
Not missing that. He put that in with angst #letsgo #isles
@r_gatt refs are from Manitoba
Refs from Manitoba and Hamonic isn't out there, hence they are against us tonight #Isles
Tavares is getting pissed #Isles
@dfriedmanonnyi I actually 150% agree with you on this one. Neilsen would do well with leddy though on PP2. Brings a calming controller
@dfriedmanonnyi @garylawless Good, he always seems to score from a strange angle
Feeling good that I picked up Kulemin in fantasy today. Loving our Top 9 right now. Just need top line to show more at even strength #Isles
Like Peter Parker, I suddenly woke up with abs. And some crazy shower hair! #fitness #abs… 
@ianaLittle some chill music. Windows down #liberating #relaxation

“@bigj2377: So can anyone in the @NHL explain why 3 second was added on icing at #isles #toronto #screwjob” so Franz could get the hatty
All of the goal scoring is great but the #Isles need to learn to win a few games 2-1. Defense wins championships. We know they can score now

OH. MY. GOD. I WILL LOSE IT

@Ballaban @IslesInsight hey I know ray! He's a great guy #raytheplumber #smartmarketing
Great pressure by Kulemin there. Must of drank his #Kulaid today. Had a feeling he would put one up tonight. #isles
@Razor5Hole And really with the Purrell comment? When the Ebola situation culminates in Dallas (Yes an #Islesfan in Dallas) #4CupsBeatsClean
@Razor5Hole Interesting pre-game report… but was he taking shots of tequila before hand? Not looking to composed there fella #Isles #Stars

@sp19hockey Absolutely. Just gotta grind it out
@sp19hockey Stars can be very physical. Big bodies. Benn is the sneaky one that can kill you. Guys can't lose their assignments #Isles


Love you lmao
With the #Pens blowing a 2 goal lead and losing in OT, tonight's win feels that much sweater baby! #Isles #Hockey
Wow Pittsburgh… Learn to hold a lead. #LOL #Isles #Memories #Timesarechanging
@FuckingHenrik30 shut up Henrik
@NotMattyMarts #IslesandBourbon
Big testament to the #isles D and G tonight. And without Hammer. Forwards gotta stop reaching in the dzonethough. All in all great effort

Looking forward to the excuses analysts make for why the #isles beat the #Bruins in tomorrows news. Great win! Stood tall in net @ochocinco
And for God sake even McDonald could've hit the net there. Martin needs a lesson in making contact with the puck
Reaching in, puck watching, no moving there feet. This coach needs to wake his team up and get them playing consistent fucking hockey
Bad luck for Bails. He was starting to feel fan support finally #isles
Now this is some solid Islander Hockey! #isles
@strome18 almost gave me wood. If only he finished that open ice check HARD #isles #takethebody #scorerscanhit
Love that JT takes the hit like a man. No one has a fuss. Good hard hockey hit and move on. Playing to win. #isles #bruins #oldtimehockey
I like the battle level of the Frans line. Kulemin with the big body and Bailey actually winning battles. #isles

Just want to take a second to point out the GREAT article by @DeeKarl here: 
@hackswithhaggs Watch Karma bite him in the ass
@chrishowrad That would be sweeeeet
Been saying it from the start, biggest issue in these games has been the coach. Teams go through slumps. Coach makes the difference #Isles
@NYIFansForLife @KeithLHHockey @Schultz88 yea that closed door meeting should be with a new coach
Did vanek kick that in? #isles
The theme of tonight: "Hit the Net"
This 4th line is brutal tonight
@ericaa_millerr hungry for a Johnny Brocket!
The most anticipated moment on game day #islestwitter #islesnation #isles #hockey #nhl #LeafsNation #anticipation 
@Chrishowrad wonder if my dude Ryan is at the event with her

@Shannon_Hogan I think that 2nd line will be deceptive and the third line will be sitting down Kessel and Van Reimsdyk
“@BattleLevel: @PrayIslesBattle @IslesWild i said it one time in the third and we let in 4 quick goals lol” #yoursilenceisappreciated
@IslandersNation have 4 for me
@BattleLevel @IslesWild ooo cappy. Always so superstitious
@IslandJudgement I was excited... Then I was not...
@islestopshelf Strome needs that guidance from 51 to be better with his possession and timing. He'll get plenty of better looks now too.
@islestopshelf Grabbo made the difference on that 2nd line. Adding 86 and 15 to 29s flanks gives a lot of size for a big shutdown line
Someone's got jokes. #isles “@michaelgrange: "I think talent-wise, there's not too much difference" -- Kadri being Kadri on John Tavares"
@islestopshelf English?
Strome will be put to test tonight with 12 and 51. Needs a lesson in defensive responsibility. Turn over more pucks then you turn up #isles
Going to be interesting to see how 12-51-18 mesh, feel like they could be a sneak offensive threat with a great counter attack. #isles
Lots of criticism on the new look 2 and 3 lines for the #isles - I'm a fan of the big boy line of 84-29-15 #hustle #grit #winbattles

I need to find a Dallas Hockey League or Beer league to play in….. #Help #dallas #Hockey
@dfriedmanonnyi @islanders1932 We all know the team can score. But he's taken 2 TERRIBLE PIMS in the last two games. #StillnotasbadasStrait
Where was our team tonight? Where was the effort? The drive? #islesfailure
Again kinda crap.... No #isle had contr of the puck.... And there's the tier. Malkin was lookin for it
Even howie know that was complete bullshit.

@Hornyqvist so you like to suck on your own shaft? Always thought you were talbot lol

@Riz2525 @flynnkatie 1. Crosby is still a bitch. 2. Malkin still can't speak English. 3. Fluery still has nightmares of @zeeker11 #isles
Yesterday #islestwitter successfully dominated the #ragsfans today will pose a great test with the #crosbitchers and #pens fans alike
What #Pens fans arent realizing is #isles actually have a legit G + a competent Top 6 D this year.. This should be a fun game. #flowerpower

@theahl @goicehogs @ahlflames @tonelli2nystrom So what you're saying is The #Isles beat the @AHLFlames
I think Cappy is gonna deprive them of oranges in the locker room. He wants them to get hungry for a nice #JOHNNYBROCKET #Isles #Yum
Just saw Dupuis's Scary injury… ouch. Gotta pray for that guy. Hate the #Pens but can't hate him. He's on my fantasy team lol #Getwell
@bcisleman Just revived
@islesblog He pulled Halak short side just s tad with that shoulder pump
#fantasyhockey #isles #islestwitter #applecider can't have a better night. 
Howie has referenced this crowd at least half a dozen times tonight. They sound like a soccer stadium. #MusicToMyEars #IslesNation #Isles
NO NO NO…….. THAT WAS JUSTICE!!! #BAILEYYOUSILLYBITCH #Isles
Not gonna lie my timing was pretty on point there. ;) #Isles
JUSTICE IS A SWEET ASS DISH!!!!! #ISLES #GOAL #JUSTICEYOUSWEETBITCH
Justice may be served
Bailey shot this one like he already put it in. #Pathetic #WaiversWillSeeYouSoon
@hockeyguy0194 and he can sit down or split lay and sill move around. Gotta let it. ThAts why KO n FN hit posts, they lifted it #isles #fuck
Elevate the fucking puck into the fucking net! Stalock will get it if it is on the ice. Get lumber that wont bend and left it!
@Amber_Raynexxx @HockeyRanter @NYIslanders yea they are!
@hockeyguy0194 effin a
@bookerT2116 hit the net or pass the puck! Can on bro you're better then that. #toofancy
And of course it goes off Hickey. He's is probably now 10x as pissed
@Jeffler @KeithLHHockey is he secretly Broly!!!!!
@thomas_hickey14 wanted that pass from @strome18 in a bad way. Shoots puck around boards in frustration after BS penalty #letthemplay #isles
Solid period it seems. Need to get those bodies to net and force some rebounds. Stalock seems sharp #isles
Our crowd sounds 20k deep!!! Love it! #letsgo #isles
And @Shannon_Hogan I apologize for my uncle videoing you as he met you last Saturday night at the Coli haha. He wasn't talking to his wife
@Shannon_Hogan really compliments @91Butch and Howie well. Love this broadcast team. Great pregame words from Howie @NYIslanders #isles
@nyislanders @papajohns Will they deliver to Dallas? #RelocationProblems #Isles
@bigreddiva Go flip tires. Great workout.
#isles - #sjsharks tonite!￼ 
@bigreddiva One of the guys in my Fantasy League named his team FIGHTING TAYLOR SWIFTS.
