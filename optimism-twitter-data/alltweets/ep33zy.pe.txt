We wonder why things are going to shit when we vote on officials namely on the party they represent and not their views on actual issues
People IN OUR OWN COUNTRY can't read/write and are sleeping on the streets and we're so concerned with the rest of the world we're oblivious
Really I don't know why we complain so much. I am guilty of it as much as anyone, but we are some whiny ass motherfuckers yall...forreal
It's hard to think or even worry about the bigger picture because our frame of reference is so small.. we are a generation worried about now
And that's all that life is. Chaos. Perfect, random, utter, chaos. It is not fair or mean, it is not right or wrong. It just is...
Everything you choose to do on a day to day basis affects everything else, no matter how infinitesimally small... this is Chaos Theory
And you thought you had a bad day? 3 billion of our brothers and sisters are starving daily and you're salty cause your Starbucks was wrong

That's very classic and vibrant, a walking disaster
Imagine it like a figment, I'm a walking talking enigma, something you never figured

I'd rather wallow in self-deprecation and pity like everyone else. Self-entitlement is the best.
I know that I'm more intelligent than a majority of people. I can just truly not give a single modicum of a fuck. You don't even know it.
I will fucking murder your entire family.

Roll up the grass 

Flosstradamus - Rollup (Baauer Remix): 
I listen to way too much music at a way too high volume. I just like it when the music hits me and it actually hurts.
Mr. #TipToeWingInMyJawwdinz
definitely just woke up, guess I'm not doing community service today. whoops.
Cama
So someone explain to me why I have to pay the city $250 to do community service for the city.
With every push there must be a pull. Give and receive. Yin and Yang. We are all connected whether you like it or not.
We're just little puppeteers, desperately grasping at what strings we can pull and what grand plan we can orchestrate next.
I may not be religious but even I know that everything happens for a reason. There are balances and limits to the universe at play here
eventually you move the fuck on and life slams you head on into another part of your journey. You have no time to feel bad. No time at all.
When people say "I dont know what I would do without (their s/o)"... I just kind of laugh. You die, slowly on the inside...and it hurts.
Unwind and just smoke one, it's the perfect kind of meditation
Core - RL Grime is obscenely fucking incredible and the off-beat bass drum hits are nastier than that $2 whore your dad calls every night.

What do you think happens after we leave this Earth?
Aint a damn thing though. We live and we learn and life goes on with or without you, so hop the fuck onboard and get on with it!
Sometimes I feel selfish. Then I think of how others have treated me after I have given so much for nothing and I just feel sad.
I just want a beautiful girl to roll up my tree and  to chill with. It's the little things that count. Aint askin for much...
