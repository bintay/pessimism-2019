@IVNNAGRNDE yeah, you catch my drift <DASH SYMBOL>
@IVNNAGRNDE not to mention I feel like plastic surgery is on the rise now as women try harder and harder to compete on social media <FACE WITHOUT MOUTH>
@IVNNAGRNDE to each his own, I'm just in favor of being happy as you are. Just like some people have mixed feelings on tattoos
@IVNNAGRNDE I just think there's a limit. Being comfortable in her own skin is more attractive than covering up an underlying insecurity
If I'm in my late 30s, I'd rather be married to a woman who loves herself and is focused on more relevant shit than implants
Not against it in any way, I have just seen way too many mid-life crisis scenarios.
All natural confidence is wifey. Plastic surgery makes diamonds out of dust. Just my opinion.
@VaneTHEcreatrix that's pretty dumb

@JanelChristine obviously it's by choice, the most common tasks anyone needs to do on a day-to-day require you to gaze into a screen.
@JanelChristine that's not the point. The point is, waking up one day and going the whole day without looking at screens would be difficult
@JanelChristine so people with office jobs who sit at the computer all day have a choice?
@JanelChristine no matter where you are.. Work, school, grocery store, driving... At some point you're constantly relying on a screen.
