I'm still too sick to read this sucks so many things
Album leaks are one of my least favorite things in the entire world. Where is the respect for the artist?
Please teach me how to play the harp someone
I'm going to write a mini series called cross stitching on narcotics.
For a second I thought this was real I almost threw up out of excitement 
My job probably thinks I'm the biggest flake but actually my body just sucks ass
If I start puking again then I fucking give up on myself.
S/o to almost passing out at work.
@PoemsPorn half of the things I write are titled exactly as this is
Sappy posts are over ok I'm sorry just missin my Roo.
But I can't wait until he visits and I can show him off to my family bc I finally am with a man I can be proud to be with.
@righteoustiger but I'm thankful to have someone worth waiting for.
Always wishing Joey lived closer.
I live over an hour away and yet my sisters still steal my clothes <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
So beautiful 
Melissa sending me prom pics made my day. She is actually a Disney princess.
Joey is too good to me.
I haven't read a book in 3 days. This is so harmful to me I need to get better
I had a dream I bought a chocolate covered rug. Even in my dream I instantly regretted that purchase.
@Melissa_H_Smith is so beautiful
I've been on 11 different prescription meds since Sunday lmao
Accidentally hitting so many buttons im sorry I'm drugged out and not by choice
My paycheck is going to suck next week but that's ok because I needed to get healthy
When your body is trying to fix problems with your kidneys and it accidentally makes you so dehydrated that you damage your kidneys <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
Well maybe not cause I can't breathe lmao
God bless being born the year I was if I was one year older Id have to wait a lot longer for a room
At the hospital again homies <OK HAND SIGN>
Can the hospital come to me instead this time
@righteoustiger but holy hell it sucks going through it
Have to keep reminding myself that whatever this sickness is, it'll pass.
I'm beyond pale right now. I'm basically translucent

I have never felt more miserable
@TeddyET @KidCudi haha no I was telling him that I wasn't a very good singer when I woke up
@TeddyET @KidCudi he was very nice. We were talking about shows &amp; I told him I would pay $600 to see him and he said he'd pay more to see me
In one of my many naps today I had a dream where I met @KidCudi so that was swell
@Zachamaroo <ANGUISHED FACE>
I just don't understand humans I guess
If you think gender inequality is funny then unfollow me
@bunburyfestival YES
If you think meninist tweets are funny then unfollow me
The fact that I even have to post this is so sad 
I seriously hate not going to work I feel horrible about it but I don't think anyone wants me there in this condition tbh
Someone call my job tell them I won't be there I can't open my mouth without my insides coming out
You know I've been feeling shitty when I haven't even been able to read
What do you do when you throw up anti nausea medicine actual question here
I feel like I'm dying
The amount of times I've accidentally followed someone from the people you should follow tab on MY OWN Twitter is ridiculous
I am so damn tired of this pain
@Zachamaroo @Melissa_H_Smith @Alien_Anya6 @JessicasJigsaw always <TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS> 
Losing you would shake all that I know
On all kinds of pain killers today...
Yeah so the Vicodin can kick in any minute now...
When the morphine hits ya 
When your kidney just won't cut you a break
@Melissa_H_Smith thanks bby
@Melissa_H_Smith thank u tell ur teachers your sister is in excruciating pain and you need to miss school to take care of her
Well since sleep is impossible with pain like this to the hospital I go!
WebMD says there is a 50% chance of having acute kidney failure (haha go me) but my brain says I'm tired so do I go to the hospital or bed?
3 cheers for only having major health issues on my days off. I appreciate you, body
I guess it's really not the middle of the night anymore

WHY did I read the replies lmao
Lmao I'm so pathetic I just tried to reason with a directioner. I'm going to bed before I lose all self respect
@itsnownieves Louis not replying probably has nothing to do with not hating on Zayn and more to do with having a better publicity manager
@itsnownieves Zayn is in that picture. Dissing the picture disses Zayn so what is it that you're not getting?
I love music but there's more to life than worshipping those who make it.
Directioners are literally fucking crazy lmao 
@itsnownieves @zaynmalik this is the picture he was making fun of???? 
@zaynmalik if people think you did anything worse than Louis did then they're actually crazy
It's so sad to see someone's intelligence wither away because they chose not to use what they had/expound on it.
Huh
@AHYJordan I can teach you though <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@bleachersmusic thinking of you <TWO HEARTS>
@StonerHunter well I sure hope I'm not the last it's golden
@StonerHunter your bio tho
@kenzienimmo UT PO box heightened my suspicions that you were LDS but I did some heavy creepin to confirm 
@Melissa_H_Smith 
I wish on all the stars I meet William Shatner at awesome con I'm going to fan girl so hard I love the Priceline negotiator.
I cannot fucking believe tomorrow is May like damn
Just tweeted two extremely basic things so no shame in this next tweet
I'm like a boat on the water; you're the raise on the waves that calm my mind
Ok tru 
All we are is dust in the wind
Physically hurts me to miss you this much
@ry_curtis824 that is unfortunate
I asked one of my strict supervisors and it's allowed I can color my hair I am so happy
@ry_curtis824 <UNAMUSED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE>

On a more positive note only 20 days until blurryface
@ry_curtis824 I know I freaked out when I read the article and then got so sad
@simpleplan I literally stopped eating meat for 6 years and one of the factors was your anti fur campaign PLS come to md
Wow I can't type tonight
@ry_curtis824 this is the warped app though <DISAPPOINTED FACE> 
@simpleplan please add one more day and come to maryland it is consecutive with the dates your performing it's not hassle please
Simple plan was my first "favorite band"
@righteoustiger @simpleplan still incredibly unfair I'm just sayin
@righteoustiger @simpleplan see them at warped and I wasn't. Well it's many years later and they're on warped but not coming to md and its
In 5th grade I wrote a letter to @simpleplan that admittedly I never sent telling them how unfair it was that my older sister was going to
So many uncomfortable situations could be avoided if I would just remember to not open vine in front of people
I need to cool it with the typos, man
@Melissa_H_Smith we need to take*
@Melissa_H_Smith it's alright. Our buzz feed quizzes have proven to me that we are on the path me need to take
@funksoulbruh I will one day do not worry
@righteoustiger but first I need to learn how to roller blade <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
Really though Ramona flowers would be the most fun Cosplay in the world, ok?
This would be a lot easier if @Melissa_H_Smith was born a boy because then I could be Ramona flowers or clementine but noo she's a girl
I do not want to wait another month to dye my hair uggggghgggggvvvvvvbbansnsbsb
@righteoustiger their LMAOOOOOOOO they're
@righteoustiger not that their at all related just saying they're lenient
And my job allows facial piercings so I'm pretty sure I'm safe on this one
@righteoustiger like literally nothing mentioned about hair color at all
My job has nothing listed in its dress code about dying my hair teal so that means it's ok, right?
Can awesomecon get here so I can dye my hair pls and thank u
@righteoustiger or like I didn't spend the whole damn week watching her child.
I think it's SO funny that my stepmom has the nerve to complain about something I forgot to do before I left like its my fucking job
Of course 
Out of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the latter
I am grateful for that town though because it provided me with the realization that I want much bigger, much better things.
I've known some pretty amazing people that were born and raised in Boonsboro and what a mighty miracle because that place is hopeless.
Small town minds...
@ry_curtis824 I can't tell if that's sarcasm or not lol
@ry_curtis824 you are a mountain range. You still have many peaks to come
What do you do when you're so happy that it feels like your soul will explode???
Damn
Nope I'm not crazy 
I honestly thought chad sugg dropped the name backseat goodbye as he got older weird as hell man
@AnHonestYear I didn't even know chad sugg still went by backseat goodbye wth
@righteoustiger HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAGA
Joey and I just swapped pics of ourselves from embarrassing time periods this is the one I want to share with you all 
When you're having a contest of embarrassing pictures there is a no saving rule that is a thing
SAVE THE TODDLERS 
Let me tell you it sucks having a sister that is leaving baby years when you're old enough to realize it
Where did this baby go <TIRED FACE><TIRED FACE><TIRED FACE><TIRED FACE> 
@Melissa_H_Smith hair goals
@righteoustiger LOT*** holy
@righteoustiger I think about this a lor
My greatest achievement is still saving a little mouse's life. Probably always will be
Somehow I have the weirdest breaks. It's cool
Somehow I was clocked in 15 mins before I even got to work it's cool.
Ok whatever
Wow I do not want to work today
@ClairesAParrot 
Goodnight, moon.
*sighs heavily*
@ClairesAParrot @goshhdarnit @jillianreeta what about laws that prevent police brutality? Since your convinced minds can't be changed.
@AlexAllTimeLow people love to pick at the details. Most of us knew your intentions were full of love and there is nothing shameful in that
@ClairesAParrot @jillianreeta @goshhdarnit you do have power though. Please know that. We all do. Our voice is powerful enough.
@ClairesAParrot @goshhdarnit @jillianreeta 
@ry_curtis824 and no one ever NEEDS a reason to feel a certain way
@goshhdarnit @ClairesAParrot @jillianreeta 
@ry_curtis824 but I totally know where you're going with this. I hate the "I have more of a right to be sad than you" mentality.
@ry_curtis824 the very aspect of life is traumatic enough
@ClairesAParrot @jillianreeta @goshhdarnit again, I've never condoned their actions. I just understand why after so long they are acting out
@ClairesAParrot @jillianreeta @goshhdarnit it should not be though. Humans are humans and everyone needs to be accepting of that.
*tries to educate high schooler* *loses hope* *crumbles to pieces* *dies*
@ClairesAParrot @goshhdarnit for god's sake the kkk still exists. This world can do better
@ClairesAParrot @goshhdarnit it's really not that incredible when you think about it. How much change has happened since the 60s?
@ClairesAParrot @goshhdarnit and what protestors are saying, is that things should've changed a long time ago.
I refuse to believe this. 
@ClairesAParrot @goshhdarnit that's not good enough.
@ClairesAParrot @goshhdarnit 
@actrane yeah I feel you
@ClairesAParrot @goshhdarnit 
@actrane I think that's the whole point. If you're terrified of someone who is supposed to protect you then where can you feel safe?
@ClairesAParrot yes to those who are already racist
@ClairesAParrot @goshhdarnit I don't think so. Those adults raised children who they taught to judge people based on their skin color.
@ClairesAParrot 
@ClairesAParrot should say something.
@ClairesAParrot violence of any sort but obviously racism cannot just be "fixed" it's 2015 and police brutality is still an issue. That
@ClairesAParrot these riots are people fed up with a system that is supposed to protect them but instead oppresses them. I don't agree with
@ClairesAParrot I don't understand how these riots are worse than hundreds of years of racism tho. Js
@TBTDerek obviously the riots are disgusting but so is police brutality. Just wish these people voiced their protests in a peaceful way
@KidCudi I just need you to know that you will always have hold on a piece of my soul. I owe you so much.
And now I'm finished.
@righteoustiger I will never support violence but I will also never support racism. I dont agree w/ their actions but I agree w/ their cause
If you ignore why these people are rioting then you are just as violent as they are.
@Alien_Anya6

If you choose to make a joke out of this situation then you are fucking disgusting.
I am so sorry for those who chose to protest peacefully today. Their voice needed to be heard and this violence is suffocating it. <PENSIVE FACE>
I don't know why one human would ever want to hurt another human. <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@Melissa_H_Smith u no wat pic im thinkin of dont u

Why do I still even expect the movie to live up to the book at this point <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
The problem with making the shining in the 80s is there are so many crucial parts that just couldn't be done &amp; it makes it a horrible movie
Been watching the shining for 30 mins and I already hate it. Why ruin a great book??????
Wow this really sucks hahahahaha

Can't wait to get home and cuddle my monty.
I love my family and the few friends I still have in this region but it's long past time for me to get a move on.
I swear if 5 years from now I live in this area and its not because I'm working for the U.S. Government then please shoot me in the calf

Never been so sad to be back in the dmv
So close homies
Still going home tonight <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Homies I may be staying another night in Tampa. They asked for volunteers I will know in 20 if my prayers were answered.
Please tell me why I run into someone random that I know every place I go
@righteoustiger or that there is some issue and my flight gets delayed in general
Please pray that my flight asks for someone to opt out and fly at a later date.
Really don't wanna go back to work tomorrow
Man how am I going to force myself through security.
The closer I get to my flight leaving the sadder I get. <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>

Pretty places 
Embarking on what is sure to be the longest piece I've ever written. Wish me luck. 
Makes me so happy to see a 4/20 tradition continue. You jump that sock, kids.

Seriously though I am so elated about life in general just being alive makes me excited. I haven't felt like this since I was a kid.
Somehow I became the luckiest girl ever and let me tell you it is a pleasant feeling

Monty has never been certified or trained to help with any of my issues but he's never once failed me. I couldn't ask for a better dog.
Fun fact: Monté Vista was the psychiatric hospital I stayed at in Vegas. I twisted Monté to get Monty. The name of my therapy dog.
Melissa took a quiz on buzzfeed called what is your dog name and got Monty that is awesome
HAPPY BIRTHDAY FRED AND GEORGE WEASLEY
@Melissa_H_Smith you made some very good choices young padawan

@Justin_5591 WORRY LIST IS THE BEST SONG LIVE
Officially seeing @twentyonepilots and @echosmith with @Melissa_H_Smith and @Alien_Anya6 in September #happyearlybday
@JessicasJigsaw I feel like a dog chewed it
It gets better.
@righteoustiger I think that's kind of a testament to how much both of us love books
When I was a kid I would steal @JessicasJigsaw's books from her room. She hid them so they would stay in good shape.
@righteoustiger as in based on the people I know I feel like the average should be higher but I guess not.
Honestly I find it hard to believe that on average people only read 13 books a year though like that number is so low to me.
I'm feeling pretty proud that it's not even April and I've already read more books than the average American does annually.
@righteoustiger lmao I'm going from Stephen King to Nora Roberts lmfao
After the book I'm reading now I think I'm going to read Nora Roberts' Boonsboro trilogy just for kicks
@funksoulbruh actual quote from message
@funksoulbruh cole 80% of people don't go to church today don't become a statistic
2 unknown numbers texted me today in massive group chats telling me to remember Jesus.
It's 11 am and I've already finished 2 books today it's cool
I think the saddest thing in the world is when people become comfortable with mediocrity.
It's ok I just had an hour long discussion about taxes and 401ks it would be cool to be 6 again
Please take care of yourself was the last thing I said right before that operator made us disconnected.
@patmaine is so sweet that I don't even mind that my #AmericanCandy package will be coming late.
My favorite nights are either spent with my siblings or Eric and so far every day this week has supplied one or the other. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
WHERE IS MY WALLET
My Bank Account: DO NOT TREAT YO SELF
@righteoustiger (((it's actually a huge deal)))
And don't forget to give me back my black tshirt
No big fucking deal 
I need a water bottle as tall as I am because no matter how big my water bottle is I always finish it before work
Take me off your worry list; it'll be better that way. I'm doing fine and I got plenty of friends around.

Also if you get angry when having a discussion...you're doing it wrong.
I'm just saying if you can't accept that people see things differently then you're already wrong.
If everyone in this world just opened their mind a little...
@MiiMichael @ry_curtis824 world progress.
@MiiMichael @ry_curtis824 different and that's completely ok because everyone is different and different opinions are the reason that this
@MiiMichael @ry_curtis824 Ryan takes something else from it. You're not right. Ryan's not right. My interpretations not right. They're just
@MiiMichael @ry_curtis824 discuss anything about what Ryan believes or not I was just simply saying that you interpret the bible one way and
@MiiMichael @ry_curtis824 but if it was altered by the same people it doesn't matter how many times it said something. Look I'm not here to
@MiiMichael @ry_curtis824 but he believes that the bible has been altered so essentially he can. Everyone thinks differently. That's ok.

I like to cross stitch
@Melissa_H_Smith not the whisperer I mean who do you think of
@Melissa_H_Smith whispers it in your ear. Who is it
@Melissa_H_Smith ok pretend there is no context. I just say the name Zach to you. No not me. Someone comes up to you in your sleep and
Monty is so cute always I will never get over him
When melissa hears the name Zach does she think of @Zachamaroo or @zach_helm15 first???
It doesn't matter to me that bad things happened in the past like that person is still a human and I want them to be well.
I don't understand why it's cool to not care about people. Like there have been a lot of people who have hurt me but I still care about them
I think we should all just be nice to each other.
The sad thing is that Zayn is probably the most talented out of all of 1D

@righteoustiger but I hope they prove me wrong
Especially since finding dory is being released in 2016 and I find it hard to believe that disney will release 2 Pixar sequels in one year.
It makes me mad that release dates for an "untitled disney animation film" are announced but the release date for the incredibles 2 isn't...
@righteoustiger 2 days because math
Hey also someone teach me how to read manga
I'm 78% done so I know I will finish it tomorrow but that's 3 days later than I expected
Also because I planned to read the book I'm reading in 3 days and it's day 4 and I'm really tired and don't think I'll finish it
I'm mad because I'm only on track for the number of books I set for myself to read this year. I wish I was ahead of schedule

@ry_curtis824 me too because I never have to worry if I'm going to lose a friend over it. Thanks for being open minded bb <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@ry_curtis824 I seriously was just about to text you to tell you I don't think less of your character at all hold on I'm going to send it
@ry_curtis824 as usual
@ry_curtis824 yeah I get that I really never meant for this to seem like an attack on you because it's not i was just questioning society
@ry_curtis824 be? He can't control how tall he is and if his personality and mine click then height shouldn't be an issue
@ry_curtis824 like if I meet a guy and he seems really cool but I don't pursue for the sole reason that he's shorter than me? How can it not
@ry_curtis824 and it's not an oppression thing it's me questioning why society has morphed our thinking
@ry_curtis824 another person because of their height.
@ry_curtis824 and the guy is taller or whatever I just think it's kinda messed up that people will pass on being involved with being with
@ry_curtis824 imo all gender roles are negative. That doesn't mean I'm right it's just how I view things. Idc if a couple ends up together
@ry_curtis824 right and I was commenting on why that is because without societal impressed gender roles it doesn't give a shit who is taller
@ry_curtis824 mean it applies specifically to everyone
@ry_curtis824 well you already said everyone is shallow and I never called you a chauvinist? I was just observing our culture that doesn't
@ry_curtis824 it does actually, there's tons of studies that show that being shorter than someone makes a human feel inferior.
@ry_curtis824 men*
@ry_curtis824 and has taught me they need to "protect" their woman which is just pure bull shit to me
@ry_curtis824 yeah idk I guess I'm just against the whole "guy must be taller" thing bc society has taught women they need to be "secure"
@ry_curtis824 dude no offense but that's pretty shallow.
@ry_curtis824 I don't get why that's a problem with people tho who tf cares how tall someone is
Lrt only rted because it's true about belle
@alexelmohandes oh no haha she is much too important
@alexelmohandes she is a great character but has no connection to royalty! She can't be a princess

I turned my brightness all the way up and it's still blue sorry that's not it
@LaineyMentzer1 no like I showed the exact same picture I was looking at to my sister and she saw different colors
@TheBigTimeBand whoever says white and gold is wrong game over
I'm confused and scared.
PS it's OBVIOUS…
@ry_curtis824 he's who I asked <DISAPPOINTED FACE>

Based on the way I'm feeling Id say I have strep
You're awfully judgmental for someone who boasts about positive energy and good vibes
I'm really tired of being thrown to the side and only being paid attention to when it's convenient. That's not a friend lol
@righteoustiger my life right now
"Hey I know we made plans to do something really important to you but I don't care about you that much so I'm hanging w someone else"
@rainnwilson love you Rainn thanks for the reminder
In my life I have been retweeted by @rainnwilson and @aaroncarter it's safe to say I will die happy
Honestly I dont know why @aaroncarter has haters. Hes so sweet and loves his fans. If you dont like his music then listen to something else?
I applied to this school and in an essay I told them how I would conquer the world and they won't stop calling and emailing me damn
@aaroncarter we love you bb don't worry <FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS>
@FefferyJarris @aaroncarter better question: when did you become relevant enough to comment on Aaron's life?
I just want to be friends with everyone in the world. Let's hang out we can climb mountains or read books or look at my dog whatever u want
I'm talking about Harry Potter with three different people right now this is the life
@RyanYouKnow I know the feeling you're talking about exactly though. I miss my mission everyday because of it.
@RyanYouKnow it gets better when you get back to school. Not that that helps you any right now but it'a true
@TeddyET everywhere and the questions change all the time.
@TeddyET try pottermore's really. You can kind of tell which direction it'll take you on the first question but after that the test goes
@TeddyET oh we can of course! Have you taken the pottermore test?
@TeddyET I feel like we've discussed this before but I want to say gryffindor
I came to get down
So get out your seats and jumper hound
Jumper hound

@TeddyET why??
I am so completely and utterly a hufflepuff it's fantastic
@righteoustiger also so freaking happy but those two always seem to go hand in hand
@actrane my reaction exactly
I am so freaking petrified
@tomdelonge so happy for you. Can't wait to read it.
@timbronke @tomdelonge imagine you decided to change your career path and the entire world judged you for it.
Just realized I am missing my Harry Potter shirt ahem @Alien_Anya6
V scary moment when you tell people about extremely dark times in your life but when they respond with positivity &amp; support it feels so good
Super nervous right now
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Stop what you're doing and look at my prairie dog

Just searched YouTube in the YouTube search bar yep
LMAOOOOOOOO 
@righteoustiger and supporting artists I love is worth billions so idc
If I saved the money I spent on music for my entire life by like 45 I would probably end up being a millionaire but listening to good music
Plus all morality aside it is very cool to look at your music library and think wow I spent like 6000 on music through my life huh crazy
Lmao but ok whatever helps you sleep at night
Even if I get off my soapbox and let go of the fact that it's someone's art.....it's stealing no matter what???Like ok ur being dishonest??
@righteoustiger or trying to I should say because it's never ok
Literally nothing makes me more angry than justifying piracy
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into…
When twitter puts someone random on your TL and you accidentally hit the follow button <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
Maybe I'll go back to target tomorrow and get that Cinderella journal
Started a new journal and now I really want to finish my quest to find the perfect notebook to write things I'm more serious about in

There's something tragic about you; something so magic about you. Don't you agree?
Aka I'm saving all my FB photos be back never
@righteoustiger longer want to partake and FB is like ok but you're not leaving without a fight
The problem with social media is you think all these pointless yet meaningful photos will be there forever and then you get older and no
I'm not deleting my pinterest guys lmao lets be serious plus I don't interact with humans there doesn't count

@samplaczek hahahahaha I will accept that title for the night.
But if anyone were to beat out Bennedict I'm glad it's Eddie not even because he is gorgeous but purely based on talent
Jussssss my opinion that Benedict moved mountains in the imitation game.
Eddie is a fantastic actor and he was wonderful in The Theory of Everything but Benedict still should've won. I am just saying
“@TheAcademy: And the Oscar for Actor in a Leading Role goes to... 
“@boburnham: No! Give gold thing to other person! GOLD THING TO OTHER PERSON I SAY! BLLLUURRRRGHHHH *transforms into a snow leopard*” lol me
Don't even try to convert me to another actor. I've seen 'em and I don't just think Bennedict should win because I'm in love with him
I'll be pissed if Benny doesn't win best actor js
Wow you guys obv never listened to gagas music before she became famous duh she has that talent <SKULL>
Be thankful I've been right most of the night otherwise I would be tweeting like this a lot
And I like dogs and disney so that is saying something
Also the single life was 2 minutes and was just as good if not better than feast.
I can't believe how mad I am over a short seriously the dam keeper was FLAWLESS seriously
Yeah whatever who cares about big hero 6 we knew it was gonna win disney didn't have to sweep animation dumb academy
Go watch the dam keeper give them your money and support it it will make you cry in under 20 mins GUARANTEED
So mad so mad so mad
Does disney really need an Oscar for an animated short no and on top of that it wasn't even as good as The Dam Keeper
IM SO MAD THE DAM KEEPER WAS SO GOOD I WANT TO PUNCH DISNEY OK? THAT IS HOW BAD THIS IS

If Melissa ends up getting this puppy and doesn't name him Yoda I will be extremely disappointed

So many good pictures of Zach which ones do I share
@ry_curtis824 and people who will say happy birthday to @Zachamaroo and @brierroot
Goodnight <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Ok yes and the facial hair <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
But honestly the maturity is what most impresses me.
Plus there is something so attractive about a guy who lives on his own, has started his career and is successful
I honestly believed age didn't matter before but it 100% does
@RyanYouKnow yes
My favorite color is starting to become heather gray I think that says a lot about me
@_Marsalis imo most of the major festivals have had subpar headliners this year but maybe @lollapalooza will prove me wrong.
@_Marsalis artists excite me. Plus I'm partial to all things involving Scott Mescudi
@_Marsalis hmm ok I disagree with a few of those but not all. Tbh I agree that the headliners weren't spectacular but the lesser known
@_Marsalis are you serious? Why?
@AaronJaackson you preach it <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
@AaronJaackson bio, not only does it glamorize it but it also makes people think mental illness defines you and it doesn't it's just a part
@AaronJaackson I totally understand tweeting about struggling w mental illness BC people use Twitter to vent but I agree it's not cool in a

It's been a minute since I've posted this sweet face. 
@righteoustiger more successful at a later date.
@righteoustiger people go through slumps all the time. Just because they aren't as successful as they once were doesn't mean they won't be
Gosh I hate when people say they peaked at a certain age like that's the best they will ever be.
@_AdamPeters whoa look at all those people replying to say you're super swell. (((Hint: it's because you are)))
@rainnwilson MOSE?!
The worst part is when your body part comes back to life
How long can part of your body be asleep before it stops working?
I can't feel my left foot at all. It feels awesome
I love when parts of my body start to fall asleep is that weird?
@righteoustiger it's nice to not be talked to like I'm fragile because most of the time I'm not.
Do you know what's really cool? When you tell someone you have a mental illness and they continue to talk to you like a human being.
@righteoustiger a message from my facebook friends
Let me beat around the bush and pretend I have a point about this political issue oh wait I'm at the end and still no point
NICE
Sigh
@righteoustiger grudge eating me up inside and for that I am thankful.
I experience a lot of sadness in my everyday life and sometimes I feel like this world is full of chaos but I never have to worry about a
Life is so much more peaceful when you release yourself from bitterness.
I don't understand the need to hold on to hate towards another human being. I never will. I cannot hold a grudge.
@RyanYouKnow thaaaaaaat is false
@markhoppus so if the last member never responds does it never get posted?
See, if you can't do what you imagine then what is imagination to you?

Dad ruining my naked brothers band jam sessions by skyping in the same room
Seriously I've bought tickets to 2 different dates and both times I just wasted money because I ended up not being able to go
I'm hesitant to spend so much money on a date that is far away and the venue is far away because something ALWAYS comes up for Copeland
This is seriously upsetting
I will never see my favorite band that's wild lol
Lmao tickets are $25 more because paramore is touring with them and I don't even like paramore lol lol lol
I MISSED SEEING COPELAND AGAIN AND NOW THE BALTIMORE SHOW IS SOLD OUT LMAO LIFE HATES ME

But who knows if I was really an ambivert I was the fakest person alive so no one would know how sad I was lol
I feel like I used to relate to ambiverts but now I'm so introverted it's frightening.
Now I don't have friends so no issues
@righteoustiger avoid plans or cancel plans because now I'm like uh that was your anxiety disorder you goon
It's so weird to look back at high school and think of all the times I was scared to hang out with my friends and even went out of my way to

I LOVE seeing musicians giving their full support to other musicians. #EnglishGirls is filling my TL with love it makes me so happy
I can't believe Cartel is touring for the 10 year anniversary of Chroma...that makes me feel so old
Maybe I'll use all these shows I want to go to as excuses to visit my friends in other states <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Really though if you like classic @themaine listen to #EnglishGirls you will enjoy it

LT and I know I'm a hypocrite but it still sucks
This world is so obsessed with appearances it's so sad.
Like can we look at a musical transformation instead because she's a musician I'm pretty sure that's more important than her outfit choices
@righteoustiger it matter if she didn't look "normal?"
Guys I really loved Gaga when she was out there and I really love her now. I hate that transformation tweet. If she was happy then what does
Like this is a bad thought for me to have I love both puppies and Harry Potter so here we are at Crazy Obsession Drive I believe its my stop
Alright I'm kinda getting too into this whole Harry Potter puppy thing
S'cute 
Open for breed discussions on Ron and Hermione
It would be tempting to leave McGonagall as a cat but it's hard to say those decisions will have to come later
And because Voldemort is a pug...monty is half pug SYMBOLISM PEOPLE
Because Monty is a star
Monty will play Harry
Sirius Black is easy as hell to cast-same with Lupin. And instead of changing into animals the marauders would change into humans
Neville would be a Shar pei because fat and kinda ugly as puppy but majestic when mature
Voldemort would be a pug
@righteoustiger this is supposed to say puppet harry BUT SOMEONE MAKE A REENACTMENT OF HP USING PUPPIES READY GO
Ohhh german origin yeah makes sense
Whoa angst is spelt so weird is that English
Angst angst angst
I dare you to say the word angst without thinking of puppy harry from Harry Potter puppet pals beating his head against the wall
Tbh I own that cd that headstrong is on and I still like more than one song but mostly because of my childhood angst that is attached to it.
@rye_curtis824 dude I wouldn't mess with them. They're headstrong. They'll take you on.
@rye_curtis824 haha this is true
Even tho Headstrong was my jam in elementary school
Just for the record I don't disagree about trapt though lol I didn't know they still existed
Sometimes I disagree with @rye_curtis824's opinions of music but I think out of anyone I personally know I respect his music taste the most
I'm so glad it was @Melissa_H_Smith's first concert too. What a good note to start her live music journey on
I'll never forget when I saw @OFFICIALFTSK wow SUCH a good show even in the pouring rain
Like first Paul McCartney now Beck what is this world coming to
Sorry guys this is getting me bent out of shape
I totally respect your opinion if you don't like Beck but if you have no clue sorry nope I don't get it
Wasn't there a Beck song on rock band or guitar hero or some shit like please there is no excuse for not knowing
Wow how did so many people not know who Beck was before tonight? What rock are you living under and where is it so I can destroy it
I love Beck
Wow people who aren't famous can present Grammys too????? 
I'm so obsessed with how tay looks tonight I'm about to make her my avi but then I would be one of THOSE fans
LET ME BE YOU OR AT LEAST YOUR BEST FRIEND 
And blink is my home screen I can't change that I'm still in mourning
Like on one hand I'm so dedicated to my current lock screen but on the other hand tay is so cute tonight
Tay and Lorde have been my lock screen since last years Grammys but now there's this pic help what do I do 
“@mkruvant: You call EVERYONE your friend, Taylor Swift.” SHE IS A NICE PERSON OK
@AlexAllTimeLow have him there and have him face such a great movement in such a public way
@AlexAllTimeLow assault anyone anyway than it doesn't accomplish its full goal. In a way I think it's kind of calling him to repentance to
@AlexAllTimeLow being there is important so he hears, he knows, and he takes the pledge. If #ItsOnUs only gets followers who would never
@AlexAllTimeLow idk if I were Chris I would be super embarrassed knowing most people were probably thinking about his prior actions him
New avi is so important #ItsOnUs

Love is being willing to take your sister into the aviary when you're afraid of birds
Day two at the zoo nbd
Just fed a giraffe nbd
I just want you all to know I'm having a really good time <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
Smile and wave, boys. Just smile and wave. @ Tampa's Lowry Park Zoo 
Oh to be two years old and my only worry be that I can't go to the zoo naked..
“@Pete_Rosenburg: Quote this with a picture of your dog and I'll RT” 
I'm so bored someone come to Tampa and keep me company we can go to the zoo
Tampa smells like mold
Brianna is so smart how is she only 2
We made eye contact bye I can never look up again
If love at first sight exists then this is it
Omg beautiful german boy notice me while I hide from you
So many people around me help
This robo-mormon I know got into kid cudis after party and I'm sitting here like <PERSON BOWING DEEPLY>
Sometimes I pretend I'm still a vegetarian. @ Sunflower Vegetarian Restaurant 
@Susary51 @brierroot WHAT
Who is sleep
They might be bigger, but we're faster and never scared.
Gosh i miss Isaac so much.
The beanie isaac knit me is way too big for my head but it will always be my favorite beanie. <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
I'm only going to be gone for 6 days and I've packed 11 hats <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Where is my green beanie though???? I had it on my birthday???
I (((ironically))) favorite my tweets idc
@righteoustiger all weather is beanie weather
Does Tampa have beanie weather rn? Because that's the only thing I've packed so far
Someone tell me what I want to wear for the next week
My issue right now is I can't find the suitcase I'm looking for
Is 65 degrees warm I don't even remember
I'm going to miss monty though <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@righteoustiger worried
Oh wait I'm lying I forgot I flew to utah that one time ok good I'm less worries
Wonder how that's gonna be...
Huh I haven't flown since I came home from my mission
3:13 am still not packed
I would rather die alone than die surrounded by people who only half cared about me
3 weeks ago I actually was starting to think letting people in was a good idea HAHAHAHAHA wow I'm so dumb
@righteoustiger leave <RAISED HAND>
@righteoustiger ur tweets r always annoying
After 1 am my tweets get annoying all late nighters can attest to that
Hahahaha I wish everyone in my life didn't throw me to the side like a used tissue
The sad thing about having a perpetual baby face is the guessing of your age nvr gets any higher. I've been 15 to most strangers for 6 years
I went to bed at a reasonable time of course my body thought it was a nap <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
It's incredibly creepy how often the past harmonizes
@righteoustiger AND HOW COME THEY ALL LEFT ME IN MARYLAND
HOW COME EVERYONE I KNOW WENT TO SUNDANCE TODAY
@ihaveredcheeks today it was Ida and it was really good but really sad
When not a soul in the world cares to listen to your story you learn to stop telling it.
I love being treated like the garbage I so apparently am.
Melissa: pick me up at this time. I'll make you wait 20 extra minutes and never answer my phone but it's ok bc who cares about you
THIS MOVIE IS SO DEPRESSING
Watch foreign films with me
I love the ocean (I am also afraid of it)
41 days until Isaac is home. 83 days for piglet. #missmybestfriends
Actually completely true about my piglet. I miss him <PERSON FROWNING> 
Yeah ok
Ok night
I need to go back to school
My fb just became a never ending stream of relationship status updates so
I want to explain to you why you should try to not be so sheltered/ignorant/dumb. But I know nothing will get through to you so why bother
I love my dog
I'm not afraid to go bungee jumping though I think it'd be cool
@righteoustiger that I would pee on them
I really want to go bungee jumping attached to someone I really trust but there are two problems one I don't trust anyone and two im afraid
I just started laughing really hard because I remembered that the other day Zach asked my aunt where they kept their ice hahahaha
Also I hate science but other than that I'm pretty smart
@righteoustiger that is until I have discussions with Zach
Actually I know it's real because I have confidence in my intellectual ability.
I think confidence is real
@righteoustiger that is so sad
I've always wondered if confidence is real or if confident people are just really good at pretending
And I've probably spent an incredibly long time worrying about them when I could've spent that time making myself smarter or something
I could give you a list a mile long of all the things I don't like about myself without even touching my personality/mind
Life really is like that tiny little part of mean girls like why do we analyze every detail of our appearance
Also she has a more angular face also she's old
Honestly though my nose is far too fat to look anything like Jodie foster
Weird
Like really looking at it I don't look anything like that girl
Maybe I'm just tired
Also if I look at it long enough I start to see past me as a man. Weird
One of them compared me to Jodie Foster I don't look anything like her
My dad made a picture of 15 year old me his prof pic on fb and too many people liked and commented on it
I really want to say like feb 15 or like feb 23 I can't remember ugh I hate myself
I know it's like mid February
I'm such a bad friend I totally don't remember isaacs birthday and he doesn't even have FB so I can cheat
Pretty sure my mom's twitter was just hacked ha @Ocdmamamia
I should pack for Florida or something
Keiko...go to sleep
@righteoustiger I just don't want
@righteoustiger BUT THE POINT IS I COULD DO THIS IF I WANTED
I'm just gonna go to the liquor store and yell "I'll take the lot!" Except then I'll walk out cause I don't have that much money
So I guess I'm a grown up
Today my mom took pictures of me with a lighted birthday cake and I didn't smile and she didn't even care
*forever pouting*
“@ryancurtis824: The only two people I can guarantee are awake at 1 am are me and @righteoustiger” always <WHITE SMILING FACE>️

@righteoustiger not ALL men
"I'm so afraid of women being treated as an equal to me I have to degrade them to make myself feel better." -men
Finally blocked all meninist accounts from my TL happy birthday to me
.@MeninistTweet or it's just disgusting to me that there is a human out there that thinks women are less than men. Maybe that. Probably that
Woke up to pictures of puppies and my future husband courtesy of @Melissa_H_Smith. Thought I'd share the wealth 
Don from Napoleon dynamite steady wishing me a happy birthday it's cool it's cool

I'm freaking out
Only a mormon would listen to hymns while they lift....like....?
@joshgall24 haha I'm still half asleep so no worries there. Thank you love you miss you bunches
@righteoustiger happy birthday to you
But I got my wish so who can complain
Fall asleep wishing the pain on my left side would subside. Wake up with the same pain on my right.
Oh look at the time I'm 21
My body is in so much pain I don't know how to handle this
...nice
Wah <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
I don't know what's going on with my body right now but I hate it

Monty seriously nudged me from where I'm sitting on my bed to be able to sit in front of my space heater
I'm obsessed with you 
#hony this is my fav page I think 
Also I can't be president with our current system no one would vote for me bc independent and I don't change my views to people please
@righteoustiger heaven help those who aspire to be president. Those pictures alone are enough to scare me off.
@righteoustiger I love comparing pictures of a new pres. Vs. one who has been in office a while but it also frightens me every time.
'08 vs. '15. 
Bold moves
The past harmonizes.
Nah lol
@JOrendi c'mon SOTU it's obvious
If you've never had a puppy run into your room, kiss you and then leave then I'm so sorry.
Not ok with this 
Hahahahaha when people tell me I look like a baby hahahahahaha I've never heard that before
Love/hate relationship with my natural hair. #wavy 
I wonder how much of my life I've wasted trying to decide what to wear

I'm so mad at my book right now I don't know how to finish
Happy birthday @rainnwilson! I love you a million times over thank you for contributing to the happiness in this world
I've been waiting 715 pages for what's about to happen I don't know if I can keep reading I'm so scared

@ihaveredcheeks I'm gonna dm you a variety one sec
@ihaveredcheeks what genre are you looking for?
You think twice about your life it probably happens at night. Right?
I chose nap earlier in case you're wondering
Kinda wanna go to the library kinda wanna take a nap
@righteoustiger I feel more uncomfortable around ex therapists than ex boyfriends
When you're psychiatrist and your ex therapist share the same building its so awkward.
Rule number one of the psychiatrist office don't talk to people. Lady please reread your rule book
If more people understood me the way @TeddyET understands me then I would have a lot more friends.
@righteoustiger this is me 24/7

Its been a weird night but if we are being honest what Im most stressed out about is the fact that I didnt put my bookmark in the right spot
Isaac:hey I just read your feminist facebook post
Me: WHAT WHY ARE YOU ON FACEBOOK WHAT DID YOU THINK WHAT 
Isaac: *crickets*
WHY IS ISAAC EMAILING ME WHY IS HE ON MY FACEBOOK
Bye
Shower breakdowns have become my forte
I woke up this morning and wanted so badly to make it a good day in honor of Mandy but I can't I'm sorry I failed
Been holding in a breakdown all day
And I seriously go out of my way to avoid stuff like that but I can't deal today I can't
If you go out of your way to be a dick to me today of all days then yeah you're getting cut off. I'm not sorry
Wow
HA 
So I guess I'll go there
I just found a school that Id have to pay roughly $75 a semester to attend without loans bc I served a mission soooo

12 years since you left us. I miss you so much everyday. 
Eeep I am happy <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
It feels so good to stop caring <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@righteoustiger please
Someone watch every Oscar nominated movie with me and then discuss why we disagree with the academy after the oscars are awarded
Spent my evening with bae 
Spread the word! 
Today has been such a good day <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
I bought a Hilary duff cd today Id say I'm doing ok.
<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
It's just sad like there are so many amazing things in this world how can you not find something your soul latches onto.
@righteoustiger people never find something to be passionate about. And then I get less mad.
Sometimes I get mad that I'm passionate about so many things and it makes choosing a career really challenging. But then I think of how some
@righteoustiger I'm more excited for that than my birthday
I can't wait for the 24th <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
@ryancurtis824 this song has been stuck in my head since 3 weeks ago
Lmao number 8

If life is about to play out the way I think it is I'm just going to laugh because there's nothing else I can do
My dad beat me and I can't even play him back for another 30 mins because I wasted my lives on dumb randoms that fell asleep.......
MY DAD IS SO GOOD AT TRIVIA IT MAKES ME MAD
3 am playing my dad at trivia crack because even randoms aren't awake
We're buds! We're a team! Oh heavens I miss sister Neider
Maybe I'll travel the world and deal with world leaders maybe I'll live a quiet life in a large library maybe I'll do both maybe not
Why am I not a librarian
And yeah I'll get around to reading all the other Stephen King classics but I'm so glad I started somewhere not as well known
@righteoustiger idc because I love it and I love Jake Epping/George Amberson and everything about this book.
This is my first time reading Stephen King and when I showed my dad which novel it was he was like, "eh, I wouldn't start you there." But
What I can't get over this book
I'm crying I'm so happy my phone notified me 
I want to be mad but they're both watching such good things 
So yeah I obviously just watched the third episode of scrubs
THAT YOU GIVE ME NO REASON YOU KNOW YOU MAKE ME WORK SO HARD
Lana del Ray is horrible and can't sing
I wanna let ya'll in on a little secret
IM SO IN LOVE WITH YOU ID BE FOREVER BLUEEEEEE

New book light is bright af
It kind of scares me because I'm only 37% finished with it, there's like ~800 pages anyway what happens when it's over?
I'm becoming very attached to this novel I'm reading. I feel like when I pick it up I'm going to hang out with friends
I WISH I WAS ASLEEP THOUGH
Just kidding monty would eat a hedgehog I will take the bonnaroo ticket though
Alright so here's the deal...i need someone to donate $630 so I can buy a bonnaroo ticket and a hedgehog. And then I will be happy
@righteoustiger stop
@righteoustiger girlfriend you do that during the day too

Tomorrow I'm going to Barnes and noble and I'm going to buy a new journal
@TBTDerek always am <PERSON FROWNING>
I actually have three good entries in that journal so yeah
Seriously I can't believe the girl that wrote those things is me lolololol
A look into my 11 year old life. #usher 
Guys this was my first journal ever. I never filled it but it's embarrassing. Mortified diaries embarrassing 
@Melissa_H_Smith wyd?
Well in all actuality I hate birds but I'm trying to overcome that
It's probably really hard to find a nice journal if you don't like birds and flowers and things like that
Even cvs and Walgreens have been known to have good journals
And staples has even better journals
I wouldn't run to Walmart if target was open though target has better journals
This is the part where I start to get ideas and I run to Walmart to get journals that will sit in my room for months
For seven months I wrote down a miracle a day and tbh I'm not sure why I stopped
I filled the first three journals and half of the last one in 7 months like yeah I documented pretty heavily 
My most prized possession are my journals from my mission hands down
The problem is most journals don't stand up to my standards for writing other than journaling
I really really really want a super spectacular journal to write in but until then I'll use spiral notebooks
@ryancurtis824 shhhhhh it's ok it's ok
LRT I'm actually into animated movies a ton but I still loved the Lego movie more than I loved most things
@ryancurtis824 you make them with someone I will raise them I have always wanted to raise ginger babies

He was a quiet, unassuming man who was eating an onion when he was cut in half by a train.
I'm obsessed with my bio #Camus
@ryancurtis824 especially when you are forced to eat them with gravy (dreams are weird)
@ryancurtis824 just had a dream involving pancakes
I better be because if I'm wasting my dream on Twitter I will be so mad
