Wow. Fantastic and sincere poem from @Scarlet_Snow about the difficult parts of Bryan life.


@BryanTriangle I'm a little fuzzy on what the forum is. Is it a bunch of people coming to complain, topics 4 discussion, prepared talks?

@AlexLyttleton Yes! We all admit watching a movie alone isn't the norm, but the phrasing says stories r not a primarily social activity now.
@AlexLyttleton Yet, I'm pretty sure the "gather round" verbiage holds.
I guess my main thought is, why not "gather round" to watch a movie?
@AlexLyttleton haha, for sure.
Except, I was even thinking bard traditions and "golden age of radio," where I would think people would sit.
Why do we "gather round" to tell stories but "sit down" to watch a movie?

There's no way what I do is called a sneeze, because I'm caught up every time with whether snot came out my body or if my nose exploded.
Lauren, my little sister, just sang, "I'm gonna die because my brain's made of mucus!"

"And the traffic is terrific." Good grief, if I ever get anywhere, I'll be saying, "It's a Christmas miracle!"
AAAAAAAAAAND... I'm done!
Next stop: Home.
One final down, three to go. But first, Tiny Wings.
What does God laughing sound like?
Funder.
Every once in a while, I manage to get NOTHING done... And it's wonderful. :D
Dear December, you're not supposed to be this warm. For your punishment, I'm sticking on my crocs.
You have been warned.
@danablairebb THANK you, Dana! Amen!
Friend at school in an interesting competition, but he's a cool guy. 
Some people back home told me to post to Facebook and Twitter more often... So here I am... Posting... Good stuff.
Anybody going to Kairos tonight?
@A_t0wn2 @bryanswayze @alwaysgreenerr @derekcressman14 @DaltHughes 
You and me both, Adam.
Not sure if it's healthy, but Mom keeps me alive here at college with peanuts and candy corn. :D 
@ivanoffnothoff that was a "haha" moment if you didn't catch that. XD
@ivanoffnothoff @jonacuff 
Yes, I've seen these, and yes you can buy me one for Christmas. How thoughtful of you.
Well, running through pitch darkness with accumulative $3200 in film equipment with 4 people at midnight is fun.
Maybe if I dig hard enough and in enough places I'll find some buried work ethic. #longnightahead
“When people stop believing in God, the problem is not that they believe in nothing, but that they believe in everything.” G. K. Chesterton
That excellent but scary feeling when the midterm was easy.
I've counted 13 people outside studying. Yup, beautiful day on Midterms week.
*goes to library to get productive and away from people, gets on twitter* I am a sad strange little man, and have self pity. Farewell.
@kbayallen
Amen!
Water fountains outside of restrooms always make me feel like the restroom is saying "Come back soon!"
Gentlemen, I will only say this once: 63 degrees is not cold. Please, man up.
Someone is trying to sing down the hall. I say 'trying' because it sounds more like he's dying. #dormlife
Only in Film is watching Singin' in the Rain a part of class. Cool to watch again from film prospective... And then all dance afterwords. XD
"Men Have Forgotten God" by Aleksander Solzhenitsyn. Gosh, that's the SECOND time he's COMPLETELY blown my mind. #whatamisupposedtodowithme?
@AlwaysGreenerr hah, know what you mean. The library is like my second home now.
Retreat this morning, play frisbee, retreat ends, played frisbee, homework, lost my frisbee, and now? Swing dance in a bit. #goodday
I just saw two butterflies get in a fight. #whatjusthappened?
@WeauBilliams Your life is more interesting, I'm sure. Regale me with tales.
@WeauBilliams dude, most people aren't as awesome as you. Haha #butseriously
College is good so far!
@WeauBilliams Haha, it's about time you followed me! What, with your bio being my creation and all. XD
@WeauBilliams No sir you were not! THANK YOU.
Well, looks like my hand's gonna be in the splint for at LEAST 2 more weeks.
#onehandedforlife
The sun caught me sleeping this morning. Time to hit the day!

You was a boy like I was once, but was you a boy like me? I grew up around Indiana, you grew up around Galilee. #RichMullinsAnniv
If I sing let me sing for the joy that has born in me these songs, &amp; if I weep let it be as a man who is longing for his home. #RichMullins
@KattDoyle well, you got up and gave the speech, didn't you? That's something. :D
Why yes, I did just brush my teeth so in a small while I can have oreos without them tasting like garlic, only to brush my teeth afterwards.
@kattdoyle And I also rock back and forth like a ship, making my audience seasick.
@KattDoyle oh yeah, I agree. I found out when I'm not so prepared I could give the speech during a zombie apocalypse, I'm slightly monotone.
@KattDoyle my speech professor's doing that too. Kinda disheartening.
Those moments where you finally find the time to write something but the inspiration has left you. . . #STINKIT
I said "nice Jesus Juke" and no one knew what I meant. Oops. #newfriendoddities @ivanoffnothoff @danablairebb @jonacuff
Video editing is taking FOREVER. Especially when I decided to fix saturation, add another sequence near the end, &amp; edit music... #filmmajor
@BrotherOffice I need a new printer to print my help-wanted: MINIONS flyers so I can take over the world... also #4school on campus.
@BC_Ultimate alright, it's drizzling, but anyone still playing?
199 unread e-mails are now read. College is... interesting on Saturday mornings as everyone sleeps. #morningperson
Take THAT Prospector. They made it to college with me. 
So... I'm in college now... Yes.
Skies of heaven come down on Nashville today because the sky is SO gorgeously BLUE!! #assumingheavenskiesareblue
"Wow, that was a long green light!" #saidnobodyever
#excited
Just walked outside and it was slightly COOLER than the air conditioned house! #falliscoming
@danablairebb If I had known a retweet was comin I would have made sure I did not say "my" wording. I think I heard it on FamilyLife.
@danablairebb Haha! Cool!
My exact wording is that guys look for girls whom they can love the way they've seen their dad love their mom.
@danablairebb Hahaha. So, what did you quote me on?
Song stuck in my head this morning: Where You Are by Rich Mullins
@wmarkwhitlock Hold your horses man!
Got here in the mail! 
After I woke up this morning I fell back asleep with my feet on the bed but the rest of me on the floor... How did I do that?
When you open a fresh bag of Lucky Charms and pour that first bowl, the marshmallow to other stuff ratio is oh so perfect. #IStillEatThese
@AlwaysGreenerr That guy is a monster.
Finally saw Brave.
That was so good, I had to say "Wow, that was as good as a Pixar movie!"
@danablairebb wait, what happened? (retweet was unintentional)
Listening to an audio Bible doesn't compare to reading it for me because the voice in my head is better.

Automatic doors at Kroger wouldn't open on my way out because the computer locked them, so for a second I was locked in. #firstworldproblems
I just slept through one of my favorite movies. I don't know whether to feel terrible for missing Up or great for the extra sleep. #haha
@sirwmichaelw: I am the only one who would be walking round downtown Chicago and sees Office Depot &amp; thinks about going. #IAmMyfather'sSon
Dark Knight Rises was pretty cool. You know what else is cool? The flip side of my pillow! That's righ--ZZZzzz...
At midnight premier of #DarkKnightRises
They showed a 10 second Wiggles commercial. There was applause. #IneverlikedWiggles
Seeing #DarkKnightRises tonight with MY Dad, @wmarkwhitlock  Nothing much better!
@littlebethevans props for using the correct amount of "na na"s.
I don't like "What Makes You Beautiful" by One Direction. But THIS is one of the coolest things I've ever seen.

Just discovered this guy the other day. Stinking HILARIOUS:


"This point's so good I have my own sound effects... I don't know who you are, but someone better pay attention." #morningmade @mikeglenn
@emilyann_33 Thank you for being a cool person. Now we can link in coolness and eat jelly doughnuts while jumping on mushrooms and cats.
@blimeycow 
GreaterNashvillian here.
@KattDoyle
Debatable.
@elizcantrell right there with ya.
@ivanoffnothoff @danablairebb *Elvis impersonation* A-thank ya, A-thank ya very much.
@danablairebb I would follow him &amp; unfollow you. "Dana tweeted about Jesus again. She really should give ME some of that bread... Of life."
"Your knight in shining armor might just be an idiot in tin foil." Haha
When I'm rich I'm
Going to go to a gas station and buy Skittles and ask for One Million dollars cash back and see what happens.
@yinyang314 @egracetaylor 
If that is so, explain why everyone goes gaga over the guys in superhero movies. Now. I'm waiting.

I believe this is true for music too.
On stage again for Brentwood Baptist VBS... But THIS time I'm swing dancing.

There's a dozen things I could tweet about the talk @mikeglenn gave tonight, but I can't decide, so here: "Don't die beholding to anything."
"I want the Chargrilled Salad with LITE Italian Dressing, a yogurt parfait, and... A chocolate milkshake."
O.O

Dear customer,
Trust me, you and me both love the sauces. But 11 BBQ sauces for your 12 count nugget? You want some nuggets with that sauce?
I never quite know what to say back to people who say "Wow, you smell good." aside from "Thanks...?" #awkward
@ivanoffnothoff if you had tweeted the original I would have been concerned. About both you and the weather.
You know when you're chasing a car &amp; it speeds up &amp; it's like you're slowing down though you're trying hard to keep up? Never happens to me.
Coolest thing I've seen all week Via: @josiahwalley 

@josiahwalley This is easily the coolest thing I've seen all week. And she does it like it's nothing, looking at the camera half the time!
The pro's job is to make the easy stuff look hard &amp; the hard look easy; that's why we love musicians &amp; artists... and hate mathematicians.

Fireworks downtown was UHMAZING. I actually covered my ears and burned out my eyes during it--but it was worth it! #truestory
July 4th and I have no patriotic clothing. #fail
Today's the celebration of this awesome country. Let's do it.
Isn't it #weird when you're in the room with a ticking clock and the song in you're head slows down to match the beat of the second hand?
"Can I have one of the kids meals with the chicken?"
Just another day at the old chicken shack. #Really?? #Chickfila
Sometimes, I have to go a week &amp; 1/2 without my good speakers &amp; headphones, &amp; then finally listen to them &amp; realize: HOW MUCH I MISSED THEM.
How often do you see such an amazing sight? #thunderbird 
I felt a raindrop!
@DaltHughes if you're THAT bored, unbore yourself by coming to bible study.
Money is expensive.
Watching #ILoveLucy with family. They don't make shows like this anymore.
