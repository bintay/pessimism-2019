Oh the things I do for my mother....
@ArkhamsSon *She walks over* What's up with the hood?
@KyleKatrina Kat? Are you ok?
@ArkhamsSon *She hops down from a tree in the woods, seeing him, and despite the cloak, recognizes him* Allen? Is that you?
@TheRavenboy13 No, I'm fine. *She growls*
@TheRavenboy13 Sure, why not? *she replies with a sigh* goodnight now
@TheRavenboy13 *she runs into a wall a few seconds later* ow...
@TheRavenboy13 Fine with me. Maybe it'll teach me not to be so stubborn *she smirks and heads to her room*
@TheRavenboy13 Nope. I got this. I should be able to manage
@TheRavenboy13 Nah... Wait, yea. Sleep
@TheRavenboy13 *She stops and drops back into the chair, nearly avoiding it tipping over* See? I lived *she smiles and heads over*
@TheRavenboy13 *She rolls her eyes* Never skip arm day. I wont kill myself. I'm fine
@TheRavenboy13 *She was doing pull ups on one of the bars in the workout room* Back so soon? *She jokes*
@theravenboy13 hope you know what your doing. *she sighs* well, other than those theres nothing else I see
@theravenboy13 *she pulls up a break in on the screen* hey, someones breaking into the comisioners office, and no ones there
happy mothers day to the best mom in the world!! @XDark_WingsX
@___cat_woman___ ARI!! 
@TheRavenboy13 Yea, well, be careful next time. More careful that you were, because no matter what, anyone could have surrounded you
@TheRavenboy13 Screwed business men *she mutters, scrolling though some live feed from the cameras*
@TheRavenboy13 I know that. But I know that some people cant be reasoned with
@TheRavenboy13 I do trust you. But I dont trust those people
@TheRavenboy13 *the man dosnt answer, and walks into the warehouse without another word*
@TheRavenboy13 You never listen, do you? Get out of there! *She says upsetly*
@TheRavenboy13 yea, I'll tell him *the man mutters*
@TheRavenboy13 *He raises his eyebrows, and steps back, moving the kid inside*
@TheRavenboy13 *The man holds up his gun towards him* Get out of here
@TheRavenboy13 *The kid runs behind the man* Hey, get out of there. That dude's dangerous *Ace says, though the com*
Right in the feels 
@theravenboy13 *he's met my a large mexican man with a gun* who are you?
@theravenboy13 *he shrugs* I think he was kidnapped...
@theravenboy13 *the kid watches him* thank you...
@theravenboy13 should you take him to cps?
@TheRavenboy13 Of course. I already did
@TheRavenboy13 *The kid looks at him with tears in her his eyes, fear etched on his face as the men cough*
@TheRavenboy13 *the car swerves and hits a wall, and the driver bails out*
@TheRavenboy13 *The people gag and cough*
@TheRavenboy13 There's a second car coming up behind the van. Be careful *She says through the com*
@TheRavenboy13 *There's a small child tied up, as well as two men there. Both look up and yell, pulling out guns*
Two of my best friends just liked my FB profile pic that said "I'm dying inside". They dont understand. That was a cry for help
@TheRavenboy13 *The driver and passengers are oblivious to his "free ride"*
My heart is broken. Life is meaningless. I wish I could end it now. I would. I'm not scared to die. I'm scared of what will happen if I fail
@TheRavenboy13 *She smiles and watches the live feed from the camera, just as they are shutting the doors to a van*
@theravenboy13 You were meant to
@theravenboy13 show off *She mutters jokingly*
@theravenboy13 yep *She raises an eyebrow at his "stunt" but says nothing*
@theravenboy13 *She hacks into every camera in the city, and watches for crime* theres a kidnapping in progress on Presidential Avenu
@TheRavenboy13 *She rolls her eyes with a smile*
When I was in middle school, I had to write a story where I was in the battle of the Alamo. I said I was Santa Hannah XD

@theravenboy13 Be careful
@theravenboy13 *she folows* You got it
@TheRavenboy13 *when she's nearly asleep, she wheels out*
@Rebel_Skywalker Sith hideout, and she returns inside*
@Rebel_Skywalker *She sets maul free, and rushes him out of the building, hiding him among the people walking outside. He heads back to the+
@Rebel_Skywalker *she shakes her head and starts to let Darth Maul out* He'll come back to us. We've gotten under his skin
@Rebel_Skywalker The Jedi refuse to let you love. That is changed with the Sith
@cryisalilcrazy I kinda do need that help...
@TheRavenboy13 *she wheels into Rose's room with her in her lap, laying her down in bed*
@Rebel_Skywalker And what of the woman you love?
@rebel_skywalker The Jedi know of your hate
@rebel_skywalker *She steps closer* you can join us
@rebel_skywalker Then what will you do?
@rebel_skywalker You know how the Jedi are. They'll kill you before they allow that
@rebel_skywalker You cant run from it *she steps towards him* you cant hide from it. It will consume you
@rebel_skywalker like you Skywalker, no one controls me. except hate
@rebel_skywalker *She dosnt move, staying put* your hate drives you. Demands to control you. Am I right?
@rebel_skywalker The Jedi make you hate. They pretend they are of peace but they are of hate and bitterness
@rebel_skywalker feel the hate Skywalker? *She asks, catching her breath*
@rebel_skywalker *her breath hitches as he does, and she stops the attack*
@rebel_skywalker *a smirk apears on her face, and she again attacks*
@rebel_skywalker *she makes one last attempt, going all out, slashing at him*
@rebel_skywalker *he hits her with his foot, and she backs up*
@rebel_skywalker *in that split second she takes another swing at him*
@rebel_skywalker *she uses the force to throw a crate at his head*
@rebel_skywalker Im giving you fair warning *she pulls back before attacking again* give up
@rebel_skywalker *She falls, but rolls out of the way before jumping up and taking a swing at him*
@Rebel_Skywalker me kill you
@Rebel_Skywalker *she flips backwards, avoiding his attack with ease* I dont want to kill you Skywalker. I've grown fond of you. Dont make+
@Rebel_Skywalker *she ignites hers, a sith one* Oh, and I can feel the hate and anger in you. You're consumed by it
@Rebel_Skywalker *her hand rests on her lightsaber* What do you mean "Master" Skywalker? *she turns around, her eyes a bright red*
@Rebel_Skywalker are no match for the Jedi *she says, loud enough for Skywalker to hear her acting*
@Rebel_Skywalker *she sences him through the force in that second, putting a snarl on her face* You always knew you would loose Maul. You+
@Rebel_Skywalker cocky master. I dont understand how you let him beat you *she whispers*
@Rebel_Skywalker *Not knowing he was following her, she enters the holding cell, and looks in on him, shaking her head* Skywalker is very+
@Rebel_Skywalker *she shakes her head, and walks out, taking the shortcut to the place they are holding the Sith*
@Rebel_Skywalker Yes sir. Oh, and Master Skywalker, I'd watch that cockiness. It can destroy even the best Jedi
@Rebel_Skywalker Master Obi-Wan sent me to check on you. He's in a meeting with Master Yoda, so he couldnt do it himself
@Rebel_Skywalker *she again rolls her eyes, hopping off the counter*
@Rebel_Skywalker *she throws him this robe*
@Rebel_Skywalker *She rolls her eyes* You over estimate your own power
@Rebel_Skywalker Overconfidence will be your downfall Master Skywalker. It causes great things to come to an end
@Rebel_Skywalker He was a formidable enemy. As are all Sith. I dont understand why they arent given that little bit of respect
@Rebel_Skywalker He most likely would have felt the same way if the tables had been turned
@Rebel_Skywalker Not maybe. You are *she hops up on a counter, watching him, a smile playing on her lips*
@Rebel_Skywalker *A young teen dressed as a padawan walks in* I see Master Obi-Wan was correct. You're cocky Master Skywalker
@GothamsQuinn Trying to sleep Harley! It's 3 AM you crazy fool!! *she sighs as she walks in*

@TheRavenboy13 Oh you guys? I'd say you guys are inbetween. I'm all for it. Just dont get caught where we have to drag your ass out of jail
@TheRavenboy13 what they do. But with our pasts, crime does have its place in our hearts, and we cant help but sympathise with the criminals
@TheRavenboy13 We're not exactly anti hero, and we're not exactly crime either. We have our preferences as to hero's, but we're all about+
@TheRavenboy13 Define good guy

@TheRavenboy13 *her eyes widen* Ok maybe I take it back
@TheRavenboy13 But its not... it dosnt do real damage. Like, maybe a scar, but no internal injurys like a knife gives
@TheRavenboy13 Dont tell him I said this, but seriously, why not just throw knives at people?
@TheRavenboy13 More like idiot-aranged

@SkywalkerJedi_ They didnt speak our language master. It wasnt easy
@SkywalkerJedi_ *a few hours later she returns with several natives of the planet*
@SkywalkerJedi_ true *she heads off without looking back, hopefull to find help*
@TheRavenboy13 thanks *she picks it up*
@TheRavenboy13 you sure?
@TheRavenboy13 Hmm... tempting idea
@TheRavenboy13 Yes but those people know how to keep their mouths shut
@TheRavenboy13 Hire someone? And let our identities out? Forget it
@SkywalkerJedi_ Fine *she mutters and slides off the rock* dont move, you hear?
@SkywalkerJedi_ Its almost dark. Do I have to?
@TheRavenboy13 Maybe I should. I dont know what to though
@SkywalkerJedi_ If you can walk
@TheRavenboy13 eh *she shrugs*
@TheRavenboy13 Well, times have changed. I prefer him over the other ones
@nicemansolo Of course she does. What she sees in you I'll never know *she teases*
@SkywalkerJedi_ Yea. flames and your horrible driving *she mutters* I thought I saw a village about 3 miles from here
@skywalkerjedi_ oh please. Im always in better shape than you *She jokes*
@nicemansolo oh Im sure you can be both. Especialy to your wife *She says jokingly*
@skywalkerjedi_ Thats why you fell, right? *She sighs* well, no matter what, we need shelter
@theravenboy13 It kinda changes the game
@theravenboy13 A little too classic for my taste
@theravenboy13 Still, even his didnt turn out as good as yours did
@theravenboy13 Yea... The robin suit... Bleh
@theravenboy13 I like it. Its not flashy, but not stupid either
@theravenboy13 Why does that not surprise me? *She jokes*
@theravenboy13 You made that yourself? Thats nuts
@theravenboy13 *She walks over* that. Was. Awesome.
@theravenboy13 *She looks around as ashes fall* dad?
@theravenboy13 *She backs up*
@theravenboy13 Wow...
@skywalkerjedi_ In the meantime, are you going to tell me what hurts?
@theravenboy13 *She again raises an eyebrow*
@theravenboy13 Better? Is that posible?
@valiantbat *She runs to the nearest car, easily hotwiring it and takes off, avoiding hiting a jaywalker*
@skywalkerjedi_ Yea, but we're kinda nowhere near anyone right now
@theravenboy13 Impresive!
@skywalkerjedi_ Cant. You landed on a non force sensitive planet, and the comunicator on the ship is destroyed
@valiantbat *A croud forms to watch, and just as the last man gets one good blow to Batmans face, she slips into the croud*
@skywalkerjedi_ Fine, be stuborn. See if I care. A posible broken back cant hurt too bad
@valiantbat Am I? I dont think so *she says with a smile, and three men stand behind him, guns drawn*
@theravenboy13 *She watches with intrest*
@skywalkerjedi_ *She rolls him to his back* well with you around, I wouldnt be surprised. Now answer truthfully
@skywalkerjedi_ Yea, and Im a Jedi master *she rolls her eyes* the truth
@valiantbat Goodness your here! That criminal broke in to hq! Its unbeleivable *she says with fake concern and an irish accent*

@skywalkerjedi_ Well if your flying gets any worse I wont be *She manages to joke* where does it hurt?
@theravenboy13 *She raises an eyebrow and watches silently*
@valiantbat *"Ace" as shes known walks out of the building wearing a police uniform, so no one stops the unsuspected theif*
@nicemansolo Well I heard you wera a nice guy, so that says a lot *she says with a laugh*

@nightlyacrobat *She backfliped, avoiding it* not bad

@NightlyAcrobat Oh and how do you "roll"? *She asks with a smirk*
@NightlyAcrobat Over my dead body. A girl needs to live *she says with a snarl*
@NightlyAcrobat *she lands on her hands and flips onto her feet, turning to face him*
@HunterDean_w And undercover jobs *she smiles and takes a drink*
@NightlyAcrobat *she spins instantly and punches him in the face, taking off running, reaching her maximum speed easily*
@I_Love_OpenRP *she walks by and sits by him* Welcome to life kid
@HunterDean_w *she did so* cheers
@jokes_can_kill *she smiles* very true. Who are you anyway "wise guy"? *she half jokes*
@NightlyAcrobat via the sidewalk. she looks through the wallet, taking all the cash and throwing the empty wallet way*
@NightlyAcrobat *she picks another pocket, getting a nice, large, cash filled wallet this time. With a smile she turns onto another street+
@jokes_can_kill at the bat in his hand*
@jokes_can_kill Smart guy. You must have been in the same spot a while back, am I right? Or are you the "other guy"? *she asks, motioning+
@NightlyAcrobat *A teen in a hoodie walks down the street, easily pick pocketing two people that she walked by*
@jokes_can_kill brow where a gash is from the fight she had been in*
@jokes_can_kill Who said I have a problem? *she asks, getting up as she sees him and the bloody bat. She wipes away some blood from her eye+

@SmilingAnarchyJ //Ok

@nicemansolo little warning. My crew might return soon, and they most likely will be drunk
@nicemansolo Oh, I wasn't planning on any. Glad to know you weren't either *she says with a small smirk, walking up the ramp* Oh, just a+
@nicemansolo *she walks to the ship and waits as the ramp opens, glancing back at him, with her hand near her lightsaber*
@nicemansolo *she rolls her eyes at his "nickname" that he called her, but walked out and towards her ship*
@SkywalkerJedi_ *she pulls you out and lays you on the ground* Master?
@ActualHuntress Same!
@ValiantBat Rp?
@LeRedHood rp?
@hunterdean_w *She smiles and orders another beer*
@nicemansolo *She rises and sets down her drink* very well
@hunterdean_w Another beer on me? *She asks, looking at his nearly empty one*
@hunterdean_w *She laughs* true
@hunterdean_w I see. Is it a good job?
@theravenboy13 *She follows, but keeps a safe distance just in case*
@nicemansolo Hopefully we can sir. In the mean time though, the rest of the load is ready for transport *she gives a small smile*
@TheRavenboy13 Cool!!!! That''s amazing!! I love it!
@TheRavenboy13 that'll creep any criminal out *she laughs* I like it though
@TheRavenboy13 then put the hood on fool! *she laughs*
@TheRavenboy13 I like it!! Much better
@TheRavenboy13 *she sets it to what he wants and walks back in after giving him time to change*
@TheRavenboy13 Super fucking hard p? Thats not odd *she jokes and heads the training room*
@TheRavenboy13 you should. It would be so cool
@TheRavenboy13 OOhh sounds cool!
@itsaaylasecura No problem :-)
@nicemansolo Exactly. Rumor has it that their supplies were low and they took what they needed
@nicemansolo as do I mr. Solo. You got everything that I was supposed to ration out. The Jedi confiscated nearly all of it
@nicemansolo thats all I could get. I was scraping the bottom of the barel. Its all gone. It would be monts until the next shipment
@nicemansolo supplies are low mr. Solo. I managed to scrape up about 3/4ths of it. my team did their best, but like I said, suplies are low
Vadering 
@nicemansolo *she grabs a drink from a passing waitress and passes it to him as she sits* Thanks. I've got the supplies in my ship for you
What a sense of humor 
Simply clever 
@nicemansolo Someone who made arrangements with you for a shipment
@nicemansolo *she stops at the bar for a quick drink and walks over and sits across from him* Han Solo?
@nicemansolo *The teen follows him, a smirk on her face. She was his contact, due to having to switch with a friend last minute*
@nicemansolo *A teenager at a smuggler hangout leans on the wall with a lightsaber hanging from her belt, looking at him as he passes*
@itsaaylasecura For someone you know about? Hmm....  "Whats your worst flaw?" might work, and that way if they lie on it, you know its lying
@TheRavenboy13 It means Follow Friday. Its kinda where you promote your favorite accounts
@nicemansolo Yes you Solo
@nicemansolo Rp?
This is terrifyingly awesome Joker!
Lightsabers make everything better 
@hunterdean_w really now? Interesting. If I migtht ask, whats the mission to where you have to be undercover?
@hunterdean_w well now that curiositys gotten the best of me. Whats your real job?
@hunterdean_w not really. You were pretty convincing
@hunterdean_w *She laughs* dont blame you. Boring profession
@HunterDean_w *she watches his face and smiles* I can read between the lines. As much as you may like flowers, I can tell your no florist
@HunterDean_w *she tries her hardest not to smile or laugh and succeeds* Well, at least your committed
@HunterDean_w Sorry. It's not that bad though, is it? I mean, as long as you enjoy it and get good money
@HunterDean_w *she smiles* that's a shame. We could use a florist here in town *she teases lightly*
@HunterDean_w Who's your brother?
@HunterDean_w *she laughs* You dont! I'm sorry but you look more like a lawyer or something like that
@HunterDean_w No, not that, its just that... Ok maybe I am *she stops laughing and tries desperately to keep a straight face*
@HunterDean_w *she covers her mouth to keep from laughing but fails pretty badly* I'm sorry, I shouldn't be laughing, but I cant help it
@HunterDean_w Really now? Wedding florist? Is it that difficult?
@HunterDean_w What do you do for work? *she sips her beer*
@HunterDean_w So, what are /you/ doing here by yourself?
@HunterDean_w Well I was looking for a good time, but I guess it just showed up *she laughs lightly*
@TheRavenboy13 Yea? What about it?
@HunterDean_w *A woman sitting by herself also looking around notices him and smiles*
@TheRavenboy13 So like... an angel rescue thing?
@TheRavenboy13 Like what?
@TheRavenboy13 What is it?
@TheRavenboy13 *she follows him, jogging for a second to catch up*
@TheRavenboy13 Yea!
@TheRavenboy13 Oh *she sits in a rolling chair and sits crossleged*
Falling and laughing 
@TheRavenboy13 Whats that? *She asks, looking at the device*
@theravenboy13 *She watches silently from the other side of the room, petting demon*
@theravenboy13 *a little while later she comes in, folowed by demon and furball*
@theravenboy13 *She calls and tells them of the arangements for the funeral, and then calls a friend to tell them the news*

@theravenboy13 and was put in a foster family. They just found her beaten body. Her foster father did it to her. She saved me more than once
@theravenboy13 just the perfect example of why I hate this city. One of my best friends was stuck in the same life I was. She got found tho+
@theravenboy13 yea... Just a friend...
@rockawsomeness (unless you want it to be just friends...) well, I suguest you clean up that blood
@rockawsomeness (dating work?) what?
@amythewolf_ *she scratches behind her ear* easy. They're in my parents room, dont worry
@rockawsomeness forget it *she shakes her head but smiles* (whats their relationship? Friends? Family? Dating?)
@amythewolf_ *she walks home, and the second she opens the door, the meows of the kittens she brought home earlier are heard*
@rockawsomeness You eat someone, like thats not bad enough, and then you act like nothing happened
@amythewolf_ *She smiles and pets her as she walks out of the forest*
@rockawsomeness Rock... You worry me sometimes
@amythewolf_ Flower? Pretty... Ok flower

@theravenboy13 Crust? Dad, thats messed up *she shakes her head*
@theravenboy13 Besides that. Nothing.... Religious?
@theravenboy13 After what you went through? Didnt that show you anything?

@theravenboy13 I think I will... *she stares at the wall, thinking*
@TheRavenboy13 I aint going to hell *she mutters, obviously displeased* Someone should change that
@TheRavenboy13 Damn it *she kicks the floor* so where does everyone go? Hell?
@TheRavenboy13 What? Thats almost exactly what HE said.... Who was it conquered by?
@TheRavenboy13 But?
@TheRavenboy13 Yea. OH! That reminds me! What did you do to get you stuck there? I mean there instead of Heaven
@TheRavenboy13 They have buildings there? I thought it was just flames and that crap
@TheRavenboy13 They were probably all just those dogs
@TheRavenboy13 Lame. Always have a weapon with you. That's the first rule in the book
@TheRavenboy13 You could have just used a smoke bomb or something
@TheRavenboy13 I wouldnt say that. You nearly died. That's not something to put faith in
@TheRavenboy13 Like you? *she jokes*
@TheRavenboy13 If you eat that rabbit I will have Demon eat you *she says to the cat, watching it*
@TheRavenboy13 *she props her feet up on the table and downs some milk before looking around* furball?
@TheRavenboy13 Guess you're right
@TheRavenboy13 So not cool dad *she rolls her eyes but laughs*
@TheRavenboy13 Yea yea yea dad *she turns slightly red*
@TheRavenboy13 *She rolls her eyes and tosses him some meat* I'm not a strip of bacon. I dont need my leg to smell like you. Stop it
@TheRavenboy13 Oh my God dad gross *she looks at Demon* You disgust me
@theravenboy13 well concidering I run around at night beating up people Im not going to smell like a princess.&amp; demon used the towels not me
@theravenboy13 ha ha very funny *she sticks her tounge out at him*
@theravenboy13 yea, basicly. it makes time for fun, friends and family. besides, we'd scare him to death
@theravenboy13 its not an "issue". besides, I like being single. it makes so much more time for what matters
@theravenboy13 egged a house, let their dogs out... etc
@theravenboy13 friends place. me and about 10 others. we kinda had to run when the neighbors called the cops for a "disterbance"
@theravenboy13 I smelled it. it smells good *she sits at the table*

@theravenboy13 *she does the same, but changes and slips out to meet some friends*
@theravenboy13 dad chill, I wont

@theravenboy13 Well your certainly what makes it LOOK bad! *She teases, laughing*
@theravenboy13 Eh. It was actualy pretty peacefull. Not as bad as I thought it would be
@theravenboy13 As usual *she smiles*
@theravenboy13 Yea, it was. Although a little pain would have done you good *she jumps off the table and kicks his legs out from under him*
@theravenboy13 Best I ever made was not killing you when you chased me *she teases, pointing a knife at him out of no where*
@theravenboy13 Yea, it was *she raises an eyebrow* one of the best
@theravenboy13 That was a pretty good choice you made though dearest father *she smirks*
@theravenboy13 Anyone that loves the joker is crazy *she laughs* you sure know how to pick em
@theravenboy13 She tried to kill a 14 year old?
@theravenboy13 I dont know but I have a feeling its going to end a lot like the catwoman story u told me when I was picking my wardrobe did
@theravenboy13 Is this going where I think it is?
@theravenboy13 *She sits on the table and looks at him with big, expecting eyes, like a child waiting for a story* do tell

@theravenboy13 It was? Crap, I musta been out killing that dude that- um, anyway, yea, it was
My boyfriends last name is Watts. I cant help but say "Watts up Watts?" every time I see him
@theravenboy13 probably a smart idea. that way you dont end up dead forever *she looks up at him* im glad your home dad
@TheRavenboy13 Well the way you go around and practically ask to get killed, that'll be sooner than you think *she smiles slightly*
@TheRavenboy13 *she nods but keeps looking down* yea.....

@KittenOfGotham *she smiles* hey, be glad they care
@XDark_WingsX @TheRavenboy13 *she pulls up two chairs, one for her and Jinx*
If they can save the world, you can make it through the day

@xdark_wingsx @theravenboy13 *She opens her mouth to say something but cant at the sight* I...
@theravenboy13 @xdark_wingsx *Ace hesitantly knocks on the door and sticks her head in*
@theravenboy13 K tnx. can I jump in here?
@theravenboy13 thats not good. That where you left off?
@theravenboy13 Oh boy. Thats bad
*Ace is out skateboarding when she gets a text from a friend that someone has been shot, but that's all* what the...? 
#MyExIn5Words  he is definitely not Batman
@TheRavenboy13 What happened to him?
@theravenboy13 Rp?
@theravenboy13 Tnx. Made my day better :)
@theravenboy13 Yea. Its flat out sad. anyway, thanks again For letting me vent
@theravenboy13 Sad that people cause that. Am I right?
@theravenboy13 Yea, true. Tnx. Sry, just needed to vent a little
@theravenboy13 yea, but after youve done it for years on end its hard to stop pretending to be happy when your dying on the inside
@theravenboy13 thats what I said!
@ArkhamsSon @TheRavenboy13 So that's how it went down *she rolls her eyes with a smile*
@ArkhamsSon @TheRavenboy13 Better than dying in the blast
@ArkhamsSon @TheRavenboy13 I can tell
True 
@TheRavenboy13 @ArkhamsSon Because you are a nice person *she smirks*
@TheRavenboy13 //Thanks. It's agrivating, but you know how it goes. Just practice smiling in the mirror and pretend everythings ok
@TheRavenboy13 OOOHHH YESS!!! Lets do this
@theravenboy13 //oh, just stupid people and an already bad day. No one can let anything from the past go
@theravenboy13 *she raises an eyebrow and grabs an ak47* crap, no ammo
@theravenboy13 yes! *She jumps up* lets raise hell! Or the inferno. Same thing
@theravenboy13 can we keep the cougars?
#itssadwhen you walk out of class crying
@theravenboy13 *She laughs* YES! lets burn the city down while we're at it, shall we?
@TheRavenboy13 I know that. We'll just be normal people causing hell
@theravenboy13 Yes! Lets do it
@theravenboy13 *She shrugs* Im kinda in the mood to cause trouble, but you stop mischeif, not create it
@theravenboy13 I dont need to feel better. Im fine. Really, I am. But at least we have the night off
@theravenboy13 Forget it. Its fine *she takes her hair out of its loose ponytail and sighs* dont we have work to do?

@TheRavenboy13 Yea, I figured that... *she rubs her eyes* dont worry about it
@TheRavenboy13 I think I know what it is. Dont bother *she runs sits up*
@TheRavenboy13 *she opens her eyes and looks at him as her eyes adjust* oh, hey.... sorry, guess I fell asleep
@TheRavenboy13 *in her light sleep state she reaches for for Furball when he jumps on her, waking her slightly, but her eyes stay shut*
@TheRavenboy13 *Ace falls asleep after watching some TV, an old western that is on is still going in the background* 
@ArkhamsSon But, like I said, not bad
@arkhamsson by not trusting people
@arkhamsson sorry. you need to change that
@arkhamsson but,...*she kicks him in the stomach*your too trusting
@arkhamsson *she rolls a few feet away, getting up* not bad for a beginer
@ArkhamsSon *She jumps over his swipe and kicks her foot out at his face*
@ArkhamsSon *she lands on her back but instantly flips backwards on her hands, landing on her feet*
@ArkhamsSon *she smirks and does the same, but instantly uses her leg to take his feet out from under him*
@ArkhamsSon Of course it would *she gets up and smiles* prepare to loose my friend
@arkhamsson maybe a little friendly "battle"? *she smirks*
@cybernetcyborg before you go out on patrol, I think you should test the new "improvements" out more than just walking around
@CybernetCyborg *she smiles* Seriously though, be careful
@CybernetCyborg Well considering that you risked your life over a nuke, I think you got the top spot
@CybernetCyborg *she laughs too* Between you and my father I dont know who's more reckless
@CybernetCyborg Just dont get yourself killed trying to do it
@CybernetCyborg Now you can actually catch them *she teases*
@CybernetCyborg That's cool! They better run! *she laughs*
@CybernetCyborg Woah!! That's awesome! *smiles up at you*
@CybernetCyborg Not bad at all. It looks like a normal walk
@CybernetCyborg Then try it! *she sits in a chair* This'll be cool
@CybernetCyborg So, is it cool being half robot?
@CybernetCyborg *She smiles* Dont worry. I cant stand when people use people
@CybernetCyborg Thats kinda freaky but AWESOME!
@cybernetcyborg so your half robot?
@cybernetcyborg a nuke?! I didnt know that!
@cybernetcyborg surgery? What for? Are you ok?
@theravenboy13 *she walks out after grabbing her sunglasses and giving a small salute and laughing*
@cybernetcyborg whats up? Still a kid I see
@theravenboy13 He might end up being YOUR son in law, so be careful *she jokes*
@CybernetCyborg hey Allen
@theravenboy13 *she smiles* thanks daddy. I needed that *she gets up and hugs him*
@theravenboy13 do you think I have a chance?
@theravenboy13 *she bites her lip* ok. I will. but, one more question
@theravenboy13 I dont think so. I mean, theres those "love at first sight" cases, so not realy
@theravenboy13 awww! so romantic! *she laughs*

@TheRavenboy13 Thank you!! *she covers her face with a pillow and trys to stop laughing* Dont want to know that!
@XDark_WingsX Not yet. Dad's kinda in the middle of trying to hook me up. Its kinda awkward and hard....
@TheRavenboy13 OH MY GOD!! *she facepalms and falls on her bed laughing* Did you get it?
@XDark_WingsX Dont worry they tell me the same thing
@TheRavenboy13 Romantic *she laughs* most guys would jump for a night like that
@TheRavenboy13 True. Wait, she fall asleep on you? *she covers her mouth to keep from laughing but fails epicly*
@XDark_WingsX Anyone ever tell you how crazy we are?
@TheRavenboy13 That fits you pretty well *she jokes*
@XDark_WingsX What are we even talking about? *she laughs*
@XDark_WingsX Aint that the truth?
@TheRavenboy13 Ok the shy part fits, but the DUDE part is really unhelpfull
@XDark_WingsX Very true
@TheRavenboy13 You're a dude. How do you understand?
@TheRavenboy13 Life is so difficult for those of us that are shy!! *She hits her head on the wall*
@XDark_WingsX *she smiles* like mother like daughter
@TheRavenboy13 If I find out that he likes me, then I'll say something. But I highly doubt he does
@TheRavenboy13 Ok, that I'll go with. But still, that's dumb
@XDark_WingsX Its crazy!
You had one job 
@XDark_WingsX The similarity is insane! Wow!
@TheRavenboy13 Uhhh... maybe.... WHy are you so interested in my love life??
@theravenboy13 Im sure he wouldnt. Besides that, he dosnt even like me. And im not asking him
@theravenboy13 Who what?
@nightsong17 *She shakes her hand* nice to meet you Sam. Im Hannah, as you obviously already know
@theravenboy13 whats so bad about him? Other than the crazy aspect
@theravenboy13 OH! him! Yea, well, I didnt even think about it. Although........
@kittenofgotham maybe, but hey, a girl cant let all of her secrets out *She laughs*
@theravenboy13 Well, with her, you pretty much wanted us together. Then with him, you dont want me near him. What changed? Theyre both gay
@theravenboy13 That college grad?
@theravenboy13 Dont worry, I wont. Wait a minute. Wernt you trying to hook me up with a lesbian? Why the sudden change?
@theravenboy13 Why does that not surprise me?
@orphangirlmia You dont have anywhere to go, do you?
@kittenofgotham Mhmm. Well, like I said, I wont pry. But if you wanna talk, Id love to listen
@theravenboy13 What about him?
@theravenboy13 yea? What is it?
@theravenboy13 Like him? Kinda... Maybe
@kittenofgotham Wanna talk about it? Or is it family stuff?
@KittenOfGotham Well you had better be more careful then. Anyone could see what you were doing
@KittenOfGotham So, ever been caught doing that?
[My Best Fans] @TheRavenboy13 @XDark_WingsX @ArkhamsSon @ValiantOliver @KittenOfGotham via 
@KittenOfGotham secrets
@KittenOfGotham Sure why not? *she gets up and puts the backpack on one shoulder*I wont pry then. Trust me,I know a few things about family+
@KittenOfGotham Oh yea? How much you wanna bet? *she puts hers in her backpack which was next to her*
@OrphanGirlMia Well? You're only what? Around 9? That's much to young to be out here. Come on. I'll take you home
@KittenOfGotham that *she teases, fixing the computer quickly from the virus bomb*
@KittenOfGotham *She smirks* As usual Helena, &amp; you're the one hacking into security cameras. Better watch out, the cops would love to know+
@KittenOfGotham *She covers her mouth to keep from laughing and sends her a picture of a squirrel with a lightsaber* Hacking. What else?
@KittenOfGotham *One of her classmates notices and smirks, typing quickly on her computer, taking it over by hacking into it*
@OrphanGirlMia You're kinda young to be out this late by yourself. It's almost midnight. What are you doing out?
@OrphanGirlMia *the teen looks at her and tosses the empty wallet away and looks at her* No, its my fault. Sorry *she holds out her hand*
@OrphanGirlMia *A teen is digging through a wallet, looking for money. She doesnt pay attention to where she's going, and bumps into Mia*
@SmilingAnarchyJ *she leans on a building* You might want to NOT roam the streets. The cops will be looking for you
@SmilingAnarchyJ *A local pick pocketing teen notices him and smiles, thinking to herself* The stupid cops are dumb. They let him escape
@TheYoungerBolt Sounds like a good plan *she smiles*
@TheRavenboy13 Not really. The Wally guy is 15, so not really
@theravenboy13 Theres not much to say. Oliver told me his secret and all, then introduced me to a Wally guy. Nice guys and all
@theravenboy13 Very oddly
@theravenboy13 It doesnt work out the way they hope
@TheRavenBoy13 remind me to never let family pick my bf *ace laughs*

@valiantoliver @theravenboy13 I understand. I see how that would be hard. I cant imagine it. It must be horible
@valiantoliver @theravenboy13 I know what you mean. but sometimes you just have to let that emotion go
@theravenboy13 @valiantoliver Im sorry. Thats sad to hear. I know it must be hard for you. Im sorry
@valiantoliver @theravenboy13 Well, I cant complain. Dad adopted me a while back and lets just sum it up to its been nice having family
@valiantoliver @theravenboy13 Im sure you are. Im sorry to hear about your position being taken. That must really stink
@valiantoliver @theravenboy13 Gotham. And you?
@valiantoliver @theravenboy13 *she shakes his hand* nice to meet you Oliver

@TheRavenboy13 I dont want it to interfere with my work and then our night job
@TheRavenboy13 Nah. I mean, I've got a few guys that I like and all, but as far as dating goes, right now I dont think I need it. Besides, +

@theravenboy13 *She practicaly swallows it whole* must be all that work
@theravenboy13 I didnt realize how hungry I was *she says, starting on the pancakes*
@theravenboy13 *She digs into the hashbrowns* mmm
@theravenboy13 *She smiles as they bring the order to them*
@theravenboy13 *She orders a large stack of pancakes with a plate of hashbrowns and eggs*
@theravenboy13 well dearest father, im in the mood for a giant stack of pancakes with syrup, and Ihop has the best
@theravenboy13 IHop or dennys
@theravenboy13 Ok *she heads out*
@theravenboy13 Always so formal *she jokes, dressed in jeans and a nice shirt*
@theravenboy13 *She goes to her room and gets dressed*
@theravenboy13 That sounds great!
@theravenboy13 *She jumps, not knowing he was awake* uh, just someone walking by
@theravenboy13 *She holds his muzzle shut as the person walks away*
@theravenboy13 *She hushes him but he growls at someone walking by*
@theravenboy13 *she sleeps until early afternoon, and gets up at Demms barking*
@PrinceOfEnigmas A pillow!!
@TheRavenboy13 *she goes to the living room and lays on the couch, watching tv, falling asleep after a while, with Demon asleep on her legs*
@TheRavenboy13 Well, I'll let you get some rest and think on whatever you are *she walks out and changes in her room*
@TheRavenboy13 I can tell
@TheRavenboy13 What does it focus on?
@TheRavenboy13 I do. If you want to talk about It I'd be happy to listen
@TheRavenboy13 About? Now I'm curious
@TheRavenboy13 *They get to the apartment and she glances at him* You should get some sleep. you look exausted
@TheRavenboy13 *she follows*
@TheRavenboy13 I do, but I feel that if wont be good *she smiles* lets go home
@TheRavenboy13 Where's your mind right now? *She raises an eyebrow*
@TheRavenboy13 are you ok?
@TheRavenboy13 Anyway *she looks at her watch* Its nearly 4
@TheRavenboy13 *she rolls her eyes* I just might prove you wrong one day
@TheRavenboy13 Because you don't have a womans ways. We know how to do it
@theravenboy13 Someone should give HIM a good beating
@theravenboy13 Might just beat him first
@theravenboy13 Oh yea... True
@theravenboy13 What if I would say it for you? Would he hurt a woman?
@theravenboy13 You can say that again
@theravenboy13 Oh....im sorry
@theravenboy13 Ew! Thats discusting. How the hell did you survive?
@TheRavenboy13 That's horrible!
@TheRavenboy13 Thats sad. Musta been hard
@TheRavenboy13 Aww, guess the poor babay didnt get enough as a kid
I have been on Twitter for 1 year, 1 month, 26 days (since 19 Jan 2014).
And you? 
@TheRavenboy13 That's retarded. Is he that desperate?
@TheRavenboy13 Really? Sad
@TheRavenboy13 *she smiles* I guess not. We'd get told wouldnt we?
@TheRavenboy13 Well if theres no more crime tonight....
@TheRavenboy13 I'm not saying that it's wrong. Im saying that in my eyes, it is, but everyone else has defferent preferances
@TheRavenboy13 Chances shouldnt run out. Life hurts, but that only adds to the pain
@TheRavenboy13 Justice is, in my eyes, giving people a chance. They didn't give their victims a chance, but why cant you give them a chance?
@theravenboy13 Yes, but two wrongs dont make a right
@theravenboy13 Yea, but it causes pain to that persons family
@theravenboy13 True... Makes sence, but at least he attempts helping
@theravenboy13 Yea. I understand that though. I cant understand how he does it. Even for a woman he loves, he stays in control
@theravenboy13 No one you know. Kinda just a flash back *she pulls out a peice of ham and throws it to Demon*
@theravenboy13 *She face palms* yea, I was thinking the wrong guy
@theravenboy13 No...
@theravenboy13 Because probably somewhere along the way he realized he couldnt. Probably due to a past trauma or something
@theravenboy13 Can you imagine if old Bats had the full rage? He'd break his number 1 rule in a heartbeat
@theravenboy13 *She shudders* just the thought is frightening
@theravenboy13 So anyone could tweak it, and create something worse than a zombie apocalipse...
Batman XD 
@theravenboy13 does anyone else have acces to the formula?
@Gethzilla I feel ya. Neither have I
@theravenboy13 I get it. Thats amazing
@theravenboy13 Yea, I did. felt kinda weird being that happy, but I gotta admit, it felt good.
@theravenboy13 So that thing you gave me was made from rage? but it turned to energy instead of rage
@theravenboy13 Super rat?Sounds like a low budget sci-fi movie*she laughs*thats so cool.Talk about heading up te lader from humble beginings
@theravenboy13 well, at least you got to do it, right?
@theravenboy13 Really? Wow. Youve been able to do everything!
@theravenboy13 How on earth did you know? *She jokes*
@theravenboy13 hmm. you majored in medicine right? Looks like you chose the right major.
@theravenboy13 You bet I am
@theravenboy13 *She scratches behind his ear and looks him over* back to good old Demon
@theravenboy13 *he growls and snaps at King, but she holds his head still, gently petting him and stroking his fur* whos a good boy? You are
@theravenboy13 *She rolls her eyes and folows him, going around the cop and dog. He raises his hand as a silent "thank you" to them*
@theravenboy13 Hey I earned that. Demon did too.I dont know what makes me more upset: that you reached in my shirt or that you took my money
@theravenboy13 What? Whats that for?
@theravenboy13 *She hops on her bike and revs the engine* we should do this more often
@theravenboy13 *She takes out several more, just before the police arive*
@TheRavenboy13 *She throws a man into the wall and smiles, dodging a bullet* too slow gotta go!
@theravenboy13 *She runs and takes out two men with guns, and goes for morE*
@theravenboy13 *The people that hadnt left yet turn to see whats going on and someone shouts* its that nevermore guy! Run!
@theravenboy13 *She puts her mask on and smiles* as always
@theravenboy13 Coming *she walks up, climbing the stairs*
@theravenboy13 She made it big. She colects the money and heads down to where she had been before the fight to wait for King and demon*
@theravenboy13 *She smiles and turns to see everyones shocked faces. She quickly heads to the counter. Being the only one to bet on Demon+
@theravenboy13 *She bites her lip* come on Demon... Live up to your name
@theravenboy13 Uh oh... *She glares at a man who smiles at her, thinking she bet wrongly. She turns back and whistles a sharp, loud whistle*
@theravenboy13 *She smiles and makes one last bet. She already had made nearly 900 in this one night*
@theravenboy13 And a few good bets *she smiles* good luck *she heads out, looking at the dogs to know how to make bets*
@theravenboy13 Just waiting for the next round. Id rather wait here than with half drunk and rich men
@theravenboy13 *She heads down to where he was, avoiding some angry dogs, tucking the moeny away in her shirt*
@theravenboy13 *She smirks* pay up boys
@theravenboy13 Odds on the black one *she mutters, watching some men laugh at it. She gets up and makes a bet with them for 50*
@TheRavenboy13 *she curses under her breath* Stupid idiot.... he's gonna get Demon killed!
@TheRavenboy13 *she looks away, disgusted. She turns on the comunicator, hoping to get a hold of King*
@TheRavenboy13 dog back to his officer*
@TheRavenboy13 *Ace sighs* Never have liked dog fights.... *she whispers again and keeps watching, imagining what she could do to get the+
@TheRavenboy13 *her eyes widen* Dad what have you gotten into...? *she whispers, but sits there with a straight face, watching the dog*
@TheRavenboy13 mouths. She rolls her eyes and watches the rink, trying not to cough on the smoke*
@TheRavenboy13 *she takes a seat near the front, in the 3rd row, stuck between two thugs with whiskey on their breath and cigars in their+
@theravenboy13 *She bets 200 of her own money, as she sips the drink*
@theravenboy13 And just when she gets a few names, shes offered a drink. Not wanting to be suspicious, she takes it but only sips the drink
@theravenboy13 *Ace hangs around the bar, and against his rule, makes a bet. Partly to stay "in"of course. she makes small talk with people+
@theravenboy13 *demon growls at the man but walks wilingly*
@theravenboy13 *He looks him up and down* go on back
@theravenboy13 *Theres a guard inside at the front* what do you want?
@theravenboy13 Got it. see you after the fight*she messes up demons fur*kill em los diablos. Kill em*she slips in and blends with the crowd*
@theravenboy13 Ok ok! No bets! *She raises her hands innocently*
@theravenboy13 Gotcha. Ill get some names. Can I put up a few bets?
@theravenboy13 *Demon tries to lick it up* looks like we named him right *she gags at the blood* whats the plan?
@theravenboy13 Sounds good *she heads to the back*
@theravenboy13 Yea, well, remind me never to do that unless its an emergency again
@theravenboy13 *She spins around in front of the store and stops* thanks, but that hurt more than I thought it would...
@TheRavenboy13 *She comes out of nowhere off the top of a parking garage, sticking the landing of nearly 5 stories in front of him*
@theravenboy13 *She looks back at him, smiling* dont get yourself killed! *She drives onto a half finished highway*
@theravenboy13 I wouldnt run if I were you *she laughs and takes another alley, breaking through a fence as the cop turns on his siren*
@theravenboy13 *the cop turns on his lights*
@theravenboy13 Crap. Well then, *she laughs as a police car pulls up behind him, and she pulls through a parkinglot*
@theravenboy13 Yea. Waynes credit cards are proof *she smirks* be a shame if your tire was to pop wouldnt it?
@theravenboy13 *She turns on the comunicator* cant find your own route? *She jokes as she gets onto a busy highway,weeving in &amp; out of cars*
@TheRavenboy13 *she turns down an alley and onto a blocked off street, taking a shortcut*
@TheRavenboy13 Got it *she revs the engine again, smirking, and takes off*
@TheRavenboy13 Thanks. Now, why not have a little fun while we work? First one there wins?
@TheRavenboy13 Really? Thanks! *she runs to it and hops on it, reving the engine too* sweet!
