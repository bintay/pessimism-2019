Well that's all you need to know. Don't leave her if you can't let her go.
If you can't scroll by her number, not dial it on your phone.
Do you think that you'll go crazy every time you see her car?
Can you stand to see her dancin' in somebody else's arms?
You say you and her are really over. Don't wanna make up just to fall apart again
Damn . That video he sent me just about broke every bit of my heart I had left
I can sit there and ignore what I feel all day... But at the end of the day reality hurts

You're the words when I have nothing to say
You're the light that helps me find my way
You're the pills that take away my pain
You're my world.. The shelter from the rain
Too much to deal with..
