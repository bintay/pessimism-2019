#GreysAnatomy every week I spend the entire episode asking myself what is wrong with Amelia.
-some cool stuff
-wow April went to a war zone and then came back
-why is Richard Webber still on this show?
-What is Bailey saying???
A two hour episode of Greys is way too long especially when Meredith is in like 1/10 of it.
What's that boy? Trouble at the old mill? 
@Willetton LOL the run on sentences, they're everywhere

Daily physical activity is a must to leading an active, healthy life. Challenge urself to workouts outdoors. Soak up the sun, sweat it out!
Summer is coming to Calgary, excited to spend it getting back to natural training: long runs in the sun, lake swims, mountain climbs. <THUMBS UP SIGN><SUNFLOWER>

#InternationalWomensDay is like my favourite day of the year and I got to spend it watching the best women in the world compete. So inspired
In 1932, women's #speedskating was a demonstration sport at the Olympics. Canada's Jean Wilson won the 500m #IWD2015

Don't think I could put "Chris Brown" and "good" together in the same sentence. Like ever. No.
Sitting in MacHall and I kid you not some guy just walked by like, "Dude, that Chris Brown song is the best. Love that guy"  #areyouokay
Kind of love him. <FACE THROWING A KISS> 
I accidentally quoted City and Colour lyrics in class today and by the time I realized it was too late #help
#MajorasMask This game is brilliant. 
"You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?" describes the entire game. The tension between time and space. The player's responsibility.
Nintendo got it right when they let the player decide their own fate, the fate of these characters you had developed feelings for.
You see how  beloved characters from #Oot reacted. How Link reacted. And you had to decide if this was all really real, or just a dream.
The series aged as you, the player, aged. Suddenly you were stuck in this world suspended in a cataclysmic time and state.
It was refreshing to see on one of the last games for the N64, a kind of depressing state of horror that grew with the characters of #Oot
One of the reasons #MajorasMask is such a good game is the scare factor. That moon &amp; skull kid's laugh scared the pants off me as a kid.
The Hemingway app is love and life

See you later PG. It's been amazing. @2015CanadaGames @GoTeamBC #WeAreBC @abi_mccluskey @linabeanaa
To my teammates, to the volunteers who prepared our ice in PG &amp; FSJ, the Team BC coaches &amp; to everyone else along the way: thank you.
I'm so proud of my teammates, and the speed skating community as a whole. I truly believe this would have not been possible in another sport
It's been such a blast, and a wild ride. Moving to FSJ to complete our meet was a groundbreaking experience I am happy to have been part of.
I feel so honoured to know these incredible skaters and people, to compete for my province in the biggest sporting event of my life so far.
It's been such an incredible week but it's time to say goodbye to PG. Silver in the TP was definitely a highlight:

New mix for February: 
Boss battles would be hard to incorporate but more of a dramatic show like #GoT would be great, especially development between Link&amp;Zelda
I'm still unsure of how I feel about the prospects, I wonder where the show could go and what timeline it would follow.
Until the live-action Zelda series for Netflix gets a writer, I'm sceptical. Making out like it's a sure-fire thing while still very early.

@ItshaydenM's presence in English lectures is refreshing/hilarious/wonderful please come be an English major
Every day I am surrounded by the strength and courage of women who refuse to give up on their dreams. I am inspired by their strength.
Ladies, don't let anyone tell you that you are average, mediocre or boring. You are none of these things. You are inspiring.
There are things about you that so many people see but you cannot see yourself. It's like looking at yourself through blurred glasses.
Write out 12 things you like about yourself. It can be anything. But here's the hard part: you actually have to believe them.

The glass shatters, and we run out of the glue we need to put it back together.
@danmedmar answer your texts!!!
CONTROVERSIAL OPINION Hermione Granger is the most interesting/well-developed character in Harry Potter + should be the main character.

@girlsHBO I loved the throwback at the beginning to the very first episode. First scenes of all seasons do not disappoint.
@girlsHBO Season premier is very sad, brings back memories of long distance relationships and such. But also very exciting.

I have a weakness for #GoldenGlobes dresses...
Social Studies programs in public schools need a serious makeover. Make History and Political Engagement classes mandatory up to Grade 12.
Serious problem with Canadian education when we know more about American politics/history than our own. Programs like @forum4YC are CRITICAL
Knowledge of Canadian History is fundamental learning. Impossible to tackle International politics without understanding of your own nation
New poll by @HistoricaCanada suggests that 28% of Canadians cannot confirm year of Confederation, more than 1/4 unsure of first Canadian PM

It's always a good night to defeat Ganondorf #zelda
I feel the same way about video game adaptations. These are art forms. Respect them as they are.
The artistic medium adds to the narrative fantasy; reducing it to live action detracts from the integrity of anime as a serious form of ART
Anime is a beautiful form of narrative storytelling, making a live action adaptation takes away much of its artistic quality and integrity
All I can say is there had better be some SERIOUS cosplay magic going on here. If she is blonde that is not okay.
Scarlett Johansson will play Motoko Kusanagi in the live action adaptation of Ghost in the Shell and I am MAD about it
@MadiRoxable noo I haven't, I will check it out though! <THUMBS UP SIGN><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> thanks!

Representations of women in video games need work. There are still many problems. But downplaying the strength of some game heroines = wrong
Some feminists argue that these representations are stereotypical and hyper-sexualized. I argue they kick ass in a purely feminine way.
And this is what's fundamentally important: these women are simply strong. With their fluffy-pink-lollipop power or a more gritty type
Juliet literally walks around with her boyfriend's head attached to her belt (which she decapitates to prevent him from becoming a zombie)
Both women don't save the world for the sake of men; they don't really do it with the help of men, or by becoming more masculine, either
Lara Croft is a great character. So is Juliet Starling. The best part is, their sexuality/femininity isn't compromised to aid their strength
Here's the thing: strong female characters don't have to cast off their femininity in order to be strong. They don't have to be masculine.

First day at Forum complete! After a 4 am wake-up call ready to head to bed. So excited to hit Parliament Hill tomorrow! @forum4YC
The skating season ended last week. It's been a long one with its ups and downs, but I can feel proud about knowing I gave it my best #proud
Packing for @forum4YC, trying to conform to the dress code. Two days to go! #blazersblazerseverywhere
We all become important when we realize our goal should be to figure out our role within the context of the whole. #kimyadawson #antifolk
Instead of asking ourselves what a feminist looks like, we should be asking what equality looks like. #IWD

It's one last go around in the 1000m, going to give it everything I've got! #bursitis #nopainnogain #gottagofast
Learn from the past, set vivid, detailed goals for the future, and live in the only moment of time over which you have any control: now.
Calgary for #OvalFinale, then Ottawa for #Forum4yc! Feels like I've been everywhere this winter.
On Sunday I head out to train in Calgary before the last meet of the year. Ready to put it all together and skate hard. #OvalFinale
@streamingcafe @windmillsOK Hanging out at home with good tea and even better music. Question for you: what is your favorite kind of tea?
500 and 1000m at Canadian Juniors tomorrow, then last night in Quebec City. It's been such an awesome trip, wish it were longer#itsthefood
I lift up mine eyes. #future
Like everyday actually. 
I'm working on this Warhol-inspired print in art. Background is bright pink and every time I look at it I want to die. 
#IHaveSeenEveryEpisodeOf Clone High. Don't even act like you haven't either. 
500m tomorrow at #CanadaCup2. #love
I wish that I were living permanently in one place instead of between two cities. I miss my friends and family. I also miss the oval. #hard
How I feel after my 1500m: 
Trying to explain #magicthegathering to people. #um
Solid 3k today! Onto the 1500m tomorrow. Trying to feel like this badass.

Today was supposed to be a sit at home and play copious amounts of Assassin's Creed day
@windmillsOK Terrific show last night, I'm really excited to finally have a CD! Are you still looking into selling merchandise? #keepmoving

@BatCatAP #flucrew
Here's a pic from the 1000m today. Pretty happy with the race, stoked to race again tomorrow in the 500m! 
Okay, lesson learned on that one: keep head up after races. Hehehe, embarrassing! #blush
Instead, I ate baby carrots like it was a day job. #90'skid
I was never allowed to eat pop tarts and/or fruit roll ups as a child. Now I find them disgusting and the thrill of rebellion is gone. #sad
Romney: That's a good question. We had a sky back when I was governor of Massach ...

Home for the second weekend in a row, what is this tomfoolery
Why do I always see people whenever I leave the rink after practice looking like a total slob #slobdays #speedskating

I don't why this kind of thing happens. You put your name out there, you put all that you have into it, and it means nothing. That's life.
