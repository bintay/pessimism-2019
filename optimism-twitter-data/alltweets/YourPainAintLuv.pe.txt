@YourPainAintLuv Making this my phone's wallpaper tbh.
She is my goddess. 
WOO. I got my first shift scheduled!
It is okay to not want to date someone you are not physically attracted to.
She looks like one of those girls who just says she likes DSBM but only knows Xasthur.
Biggest pet peeve on tumblr is when someone wrongly labels a band and everyone just blindly reblogs the post. <UNAMUSED FACE>
@DarthLazarus k gud
@DarthLazarus Yeet. Go b a secret pimp nao
@DarthLazarus Not unless you get caught. B)))
@DarthLazarus Or have a job that makes you play with butts for monies.

@eponine7x Aw thank you! <TWO HEARTS><WHITE SMILING FACE>️
Living in this world is a burden on the soul.

You're a bean. @crinn0
Holy shit. Bishop of Hexen's new song though.
@0pheliac_ You're so pretty. <TWO HEARTS>
@PrettyWeirdGal She's allowed to have an opinion of it, but she doesn't know anything about it so it's pretty ignorant of her to say that.
Ha.
My mother thinks BDSM degrades women.
@virtueofvice And that 50 Shades of Grey doesn't help to try and make people understand it.
@Chaotic_Moogle God damn it. ; ~ ;
@Chaotic_Moogle God damn it, am I really that predictable?
"You must've had daddy issues of you're into that kinda stuff" is probably my favourite assumption. 
Dumb fucks.

@MineralMoon Ex-fucking-actly.
@MineralMoon I fucking hate that. I may have low points but I'm pretty sane for the most part.
You must be really ignorant to think people enjoy being a sub because they've had some kind of abuse in their past.
Lol. 
@YourPainAintLuv Or whenever really. Idc.
Whenever I'm sad, send me videos of kittens meowing. Pls and thank.
But whyyyyyyyy

Report: Guillermo del Toro Says Silent Hills is Cancelled: 
FUUUUCK.

I can't stop crying..
It hurts to breathe..
My chest hurts..
Whatever.
I really don't need this right now.
Ouch..
All because it was raining? That's fucking dumb.
It's not fair that my sister gets to spend the night out but I can't go to the gym.
@perfectwingsfly Good.
@YourPainAintLuv AN*
Whoops called the baby and it.
Why would you not let the doctor give your baby a spinal tap if it's at risk? It's not going to remember being in pain or anything. <UNAMUSED FACE>

I think I'm overfeeding Palomino. He looks so fat now.
There's a special place in hell for people who don't put shopping carts in the designated spot after they're done using them.

Why should you never try to drive a roof nail with a violin?
You might bend the nail.
Why do violinists put a cloth between their chin and their instrument?
Violins don't have spit valves.
@ughthena Heey I was looking for violin jokes too!!
How do you make a cello sound beautiful?
Sell it and buy a violin.
I can barely find any violin jokes.. Most of them are of what I've already said but were for viola.
Why don't viola players suffer from piles (hæmorrhoids)?
Because all the assholes are in the first violin section.
@olnikwik Agreed. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
How do you make a violin sound like a viola? 

Sit in the back and don't play.
@olnikwik Oooo and Hank meets his brother or something?
@olnikwik What episode is it?
Incoming violinist jokes.
@olnikwik Haha, glad you agree. I'm gonna find some violinist jokes now and offend myself.
I hope you've all enjoyed those viola jokes. I sure did.
@olnikwik Dying from these viola jokes. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> What about you??
Why do violists stand for long periods outside people's houses?
They can't find the key and they don't know when to come in.
How many violists does it take to change a light bulb? 
None. They can't get up that high.
Violinist =/= Violist
How is a Violist different from a dog? 
The dog can stop scratching.
How do you tell when a Violist is out of tune? 
The bow is moving.
@DarthLazarus Mhmm, mhmm.
@DarthLazarus LOL. Btw my phone is dead for now. Sorry if I haven't texted you back.
Why do Violists make effective rapists?
It's hard to fight back when you've got your hands over your ears. @the_creepiest
@DarthLazarus Violists, not violinists.
What is fifty Violists buried up to their necks in sand? 
Not enough sand.
How many positions does a Violist use? 
Three: 1st, 3rd, and Emergency.
@Nicromancy Send some to me pls.
@Nicromancy I h8 syrup.

@josh_bennett12 Cutie. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I'm going to cry because these guests are so filthy.
Those waffles.
Wtf.
Would you still love me anyway?
These people need to leave my house.
Fucking kid saying to kill my dog just because she was barking and open toys that were meant for MY NEPHEW. Fuck you, kid.
LOL THIS FUCKING KID IS SCARED OF ME.
THERAPY ISN'T GOING TO HELP YOU IF YOU KEEP RESCHEDULING ALL THE GOD DAMN TIME.
If you fucking hear music being played in the bathroom, don't fucking come in.
Whyyyy can't we test on rapistsss and pedophilessss insteaaaad of cute bunnieeeees

@Nicromancy Loooool
@mralvalium Yeaaah. It's so annoying. :/
@mralvalium Well, it died out a bit 'cause of "grunge" and that it's trending again, but I still see hipsters around.
I love him. <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
I feel like doing my makeup 'cause I'm that bored.
@mralvalium Unfortunately
I hate sharing my bathroom.
@Orignal_Plan Haha, no. When it's intentional, I don't mind. It only bothers me when the person tries to be "poetic" or "deep".
I hate having strangers in the house. Especially if they have a kid.
I said I missed having late night phone calls and I get them now, but they're not with the person I wanted. Guess beggars can't be choosers.
It's never too much.
Wait..
I have too many kitty paws in my camera roll.

He's so handsome and ugh.
Eat the sads away.
I really want cheesecake.
I am too tiny for this pain.

This is so cute I must have it. 
@overjoydkilljoy oh wow hi you're really pretty
You've got to WANT to be better and MAKE the effort to be better.
I know a couple people who cut, I've heard their stories and yes it's sad, but cutting for "temporary relief" will not solve your problems.
And I don't give a shit what you're going through, there is no fucking excuse for you to cut yourself.
I admit I'm not all right in my head and I often have low points, but I'm not going to slice my fucking body open.
Fucking get help if your "only relief" is cutting yourself.
Such fucking bullshit. Cutting is never fucking okay. 
I hate how my voice always sounds higher when I'm on the phone.
Fuck.
:))))))))))))))))))))))

Fight me
@LesMiseration Happy Womb Emancipation Day! <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
@YourPainAintLuv Back to being*
So if Xasthur's back, is Scott back to Malefic as well?

@Hizu_Toons Like, you know how Scott was Nocturnal Poisoning for a while? Well he said he was bringing Xasthur back.
@IRLxTrash That's even weirder o.O

@Derek_DEIMOS AHHHHHHHHH
@pshksh so I just avoid doing so..
@pshksh Yeah.. I'm just so used to holding it in though.. It's hard for me to talk about it 'cause I know I'll cry and I hate crying.
@pshksh Aw, thank you. I didn't mean it to say no one cares, but more as to what difference does it make if I do talk about my feelings..
@lambofgoff oops caps
@lambofgoff I LOVE THE HORRORS
@_InTheBeyond_ Thanks. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️

@SuperMetalTiff Boulder City, NV
@YourPainAintLuv OH, and we went around Boulder City for a bit too.
Then we sang along to Beirut and Brazos on the way home. It was really nice..
We went to TGI Friday's, the mall, the park, a furniture store, PetSmart, went off to see the stars and saw the city from a distance.
I need more nights like the one I had the other day.
Their facial hair doesn't concern you so why bitch about it??
All these people tweeting "I still have eyebrows when I wash my face". Good for you, that doesn't make you any better than someone without.
I get that people would ask, "why shave them off just to draw them back on?" Maybe they don't like how their natural eyebrows look??
I don't understand the hate towards people who draw their eyebrows??
Funeral doom gets me feeling a certain way.
@olnikwik Happy V-Day to you too. :)
