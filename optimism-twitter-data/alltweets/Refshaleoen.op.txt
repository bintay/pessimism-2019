@British_Airways don't worry ... I'm Spider-Man
@EscCro @lnrhsynv @UzariM sorry but I can't chose over my two top songs .... They are my joint favourites
@EscCro @lnrhsynv @UzariM A draw .... Next year we have semis in Belarus and go to Baku for final ;)
@EscCro no doubt Australia comes and it loses ... #shameOnYou
@EscCro wins them all
@EscCro @jkp66fi <PENSIVE FACE>
@AllTimeFiona seeing the arena today really got me excited :))
@EscCro @jkp66fi bad mood?
@EscCro @jkp66fi partying in straight bars in much more fun. Pick up straight guys after they have 5 pints too many. Turns any guy gay
@jkp66fi @EscCro I'm no longer young.
@jodieharsh white chicks is quite possibly the funniest film ever .. Love it.
@jkp66fi @EscCro I don't go to gay bars in UK... Not gonna go to them here on my own.
@EscCro @jkp66fi maybe UK has bad stigma attached to solo party goers.... It's kinda sad.
@issavienojums @kyliewilson good job I bought umbrella. ;)
@jkp66fi @EscCro couldn't think of anything more depressing to be honest.
@EscCro @jkp66fi partying solo is no fun.
@issavienojums @kyliewilson well it was sweltering when I got here today. And it's gonna get warmer :-//
@jkp66fi @EscCro saving my drinks for next week. Plus I don't have interest in gay bars solo
@jkp66fi @EscCro ?
The sad moment when you realise you miss someone you don't know very well... But wish was here with you now. <PENSIVE FACE>
@jkp66fi @EscCro #WeAreOne
Back in the hotel room now ... Gosh it's so warm outside tonight ... I miss the North Sea breeze.
@jkp66fi @EscCro #buildingbridges Lapland to kiruna?
@jkp66fi @EscCro  Santa can host. Results read out in wrapped presents
@jkp66fi come and join me in #Baku
@EscCro @BojanaStamenov better than Stockholm ;)

Nice and easy check in ..Hotel room is absolutely amazing #vienna #vienna2015 @British_Airways chose this hotel well 
I think there's a small thing called the #Eurovision happening soon in #Vienna  #Vienna2015 
@arlanda70 Jesus, and what does that make me? Maybe I'm just down with the kids
@arlanda70 you got snapchat?
@arlanda70 Vienna will have to wait then.
Looks like it's going to be a lovely evening first thing in going to do is go see the arena in all its lovely #Eurovision colours
@arlanda70 Vienna wants you now ;)
glad my phone actually works in Vienna ... God bless Austria. #FeelAtHome with @ThreeUK #eurovision
Waiting for mon bagage.... So cute they are playing #Eurovision for us on screens. 
@mkcol party starts on Friday actually and now I'm going travelling around Europe
Hallo Vienna. Bit of a rough ride but got here in one piece.
And we're moving!!! See you on the other side #vienna2015
Parked right next to a @Airbus #a380 ... How the hell do those monsters get into the air??!! #avgeek they are huge
Brick wall <NEUTRAL FACE>
@EscCro hopefully @ElectroVelvet @iamsuperbianca @AlexLarke will come to "jam night" at Chaya Fuera

@EscCro "jam night" lol
@blanketperson how did you get one of those?
@BelChi90 shall be flying over Antwerp ... Make sure you wave ... I have my binoculars
And he has ginger hair .... Died and gone to heaven. #frenchSteward
@Eurovoix well they have to show some interest ready for Sofia I guess.
I just saw the French steward ... I think I'm in love <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Stray thunderstorms in Vienna :-// great flying conditions <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I'm tempted to play #hourOfTheWolf out loud on this plane ...:: going for the UK voters #eurovision
Excellent news about Bulgaria. Seems that the broadcaster is really getting behind contest now, surely they will be back next year
Just realised I will be flying from terminal 3 in October when I go to Vienna again, <UNAMUSED FACE>
We have a French air steward And he sounds HOT!!! I need to meet him, asking him for something to suck on for landing, and some salty nuts.
I really think we should all wear pin badges, that way #WeAreOne
On the plane ready to flyyyyy already met a fellow #Eurovision fan in departures... He spotted my Azerbaijan/Belarus pin badge on my blazer
@EscCro jam night with artists
@NikolausRLD @EscCro rings a bell yes
@EscCro forgot what club is called for Friday night. Near stadhalle ... And flashmob on Saturday
@EscCro oh yes ... Missing two big parties
So many douchebags in this terminal. I'm a celebrity!!! Get me out if here!!
@EscCro @issavienojums they are worth the wait tbh.
@EscCro when do you get to Vienna?
@EscCro @JacobMila you don't ask you don't get. #shameonYOU
@EscCro @JacobMila ebaaaaaaaaay
@issavienojums oh god <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><WEARY FACE>
@issavienojums going to the airport tomorrow to meet Belarus will cheer me up endlessly
@issavienojums the moaning will stop when I'm in Vienna.
@issavienojums tbh I've been moaning since yesterday afternoon.
FYI I hate Heathrow Terminal 3
@EscCro @JacobMila come and kiss your fans at Euro fan cafe ..... Wonder if we can get hash snitzels?
@kyliewilson Pollaponk shopping ;)
@EscCro @JacobMila should have said ... I have 6ft Lithuanian flag. Left it at home though <PENSIVE FACE>
@LoreenatorDK see you in Vienna have a safe journey
Some people R just disgusting Some guy just picked up his shoes and sniffed them I wouldn't mind normally but he was ginger and cute #ruined
My first time at @HeathrowAirport #terminal3 I guess it's time to explore
So my suitcase was over weight .... I kept my mouth shut so I don't think she noticed #HeathrowAirport #heathrow
@Maikeeel thanks. See you in Vienna
@UzariAndMaimuna @Uzariworld rehearsing .... This is going to look great 
@EscCro @issavienojums @Arianna483 inadvertently bought a pink toothbrush -I guess it's my @pollaponk brush 
Tweet25000 #Goodluck to @ElectroVelvet @BiancaNicholas @AlexLarke I know you will @do the UK so proud. #stillInLoveWithYou see you in Vienna
Any1 who has #snapchat &amp;wants 2see my journey 2 Budapest, Prague, Salzburg&amp; Vienna over the next few days add me "simonsenlis" #eurovision

Finally the day is here!!!! So happy with my afternoon flight lol, time to chill before Vienna :D lets do this!
Electro velvet did brilliant. Now I want to get Alex get flipped on the chair @AlexLarke ....@BiancaNicholas care to do the honours?
@BiancaNicholas @AlexLarke great performance guys. Sounding good sugars
Weird to not see @BiancaNicholas in the red shimmy dress.... But she's looking great in purple. #ohYes #stillInLoveWithYou #electrovelvet
Music time!! #Eurovision #stillInLoveWithYou @ElectroVelvet
@rufus200 still sexy ;)
So who is tuning in to see @ElectroVelvet @BiancaNicholas and @AlexLarke on @grahnort ?? I'm so ready for this
@ESCSamuel well to be honest it looks big enough to do some damage ;)
@Johanna7r @EscEire @DennshR it's becoming one of my favourite #eurovision genres
@ESCSamuel I saw ;)
@ESCSamuel well last year was too big for many artists .... This is going to benefit a lot of these ballads
@Johanna7r @EscEire @DennshR epic for all the wrong reasons..... The definition of craptacular
@Johanna7r I still don't get it. I literally sat the other watching it like <ASTONISHED FACE>
@Johanna7r @EscEire @DennshR song was epic ... Just didn't like he performance. My guilty pleasure had to be ding dong though.
@Johanna7r @EscEire @DennshR oooooooooh!!! I forgot hold me .... How could I??!? See even too many songs in Azerbaijan top 3
@Johanna7r @EscEire @DennshR well of course my winner would have been blue.
@Johanna7r yup.... Ireland was such a car crash .... Joined Georgia at the bottom, and yet cheesecake stormed into my top 10
@Johanna7r @EscEire @DennshR yep definitely .... Always, drip drop and when he music dies
@Johanna7r @EscEire @DennshR I did like 2011 .... But winner? Nope. I did have it as my number 2 though.
@Johanna7r tbh I'm really looking forward to seeing how the performance change my top 10..: last year it majorly changed
@Johanna7r @EscEire @DennshR yeah it's going to be hard to get into the top 10 .... Performance will be key
@ESCSamuel I am actually starting to LOVE this stage
@Johanna7r @EscEire @DennshR yeah I thought it was good. His diction just was off and he high note failed. He improved a lot by Amsterdam
@Johanna7r @EscEire @DennshR Riga was a bit off tbh. And the goodbye party was just weird
@Johanna7r @EscEire @DennshR he was really good in Amsterdam. You didn't think?
@Johanna7r @EscEire @DennshR if there was any year which they actually deserve to win :.. This is it. I do love all but one of heir songs
@EscEire @Johanna7r @DennshR I will love an Azerbaijan win... For obvious reasons.
@Johanna7r @EscEire @DennshR they were amazing in Amsterdam. With good staging the song should do well.
@issavienojums now you know I'll be buying strawberries and prosecco as soon as I land in Vienna
@issavienojums let's order snitzels in Vienna lol
@DennshR @EscEire @Johanna7r tbh Boggie will probably slay the juries
@DennshR @EscEire @Johanna7r I really want Hungary too ... But in place of Belarus ... No? Sorry Boggie
@EscEire @Johanna7r @DennshR tbh I'll be devastated if Belarus doesn't get through
@DennshR @EscEire @Johanna7r there is NO way that Belarus isn't going to qualify .... SURELY???
@Johanna7r @cin_esc I'll check it out ... Thanks :))
@DennshR @Johanna7r I've warmed to Greece to be honest. She is flawless tbh
@issavienojums can't believe you were so shocked last time. Like if you stay in a hotel you gotta order something to the room.
@Johanna7r @cin_esc yeah I'm a sucker for some good architecture. Give me a nice church for a few hours.
@Johanna7r @cin_esc I'm just in Budapest for the day and Prague over night
@Johanna7r @DennshR preferablyBelgium then please
@DennshR @Johanna7r I really want Macedonia through
@Johanna7r @EscEire @DennshR I'll ask them when I meet them at the airport on Sunday if they brought a sand timer?
@Johanna7r @cin_esc any tips for either?
@Johanna7r @DennshR I don't mind Albania to be honest ... It has a nice melody ... Belgium is gonna be a car crash
@EscEire @Johanna7r @DennshR oh yah Belarus to storm this semi actually ... Russia or Belarus. As long as they have the sand timer on stage
@Johanna7r @DennshR ah yes, Cyprus probably needs our votes
@Johanna7r @cin_esc well I have Prague and Budapest to see first ... So I'm excited for them... Followed by another visit to Salzburg
@Johanna7r @DennshR Russia looks good for the win.
@Johanna7r @DennshR I'm a bit disappointed in Estonia tbh Their lack of any promotion seems to have killed them off. So actually....
@Johanna7r @DennshR just voting Azerbaijan in second semi and then Russia Belarus and Azerbaijan if they are all in final.
@Johanna7r @cin_esc oh the fun will be with me next Friday when the party starts. For now I'm just in travel mode and seeing Europe
@DennshR @Johanna7r I would love it if Russia would win this semi final tbh. I think Estonia probably has a good chance of winning it
@Johanna7r @DennshR a million votes?
@EscCro of course. There 2 weeks. Travelling to Prague Budapest and Bratislava from Monday . Then back in Vienna on Friday
@Johanna7r @cin_esc ... Can be a little bit meh about it all now.
@Johanna7r @cin_esc well to be honest national final is always so hyped and his year it just disappointed. I guess that's why people....
@EscCro to Vienna of course ;)
@EscCro and then food and sleep. Then tomorrow I fly ...
@EscCro an hour away from London.... 2 hours later and I'll be at my hotel near Heathrow
@Johanna7r @cin_esc to be honest I couldn't imagine life as a casual fan now. ...
Ordering pizza to he hotel room tonight .... Because I'm just totally rock and roll. @issavienojums ;)
@EscCro @cin_esc I still missed a few national finals and I never watched the melfest I never went to lol
@cin_esc I still manage to get out. But then I missed quite a lot of the national finals ... And watched them all back to back :-//
@cin_esc it's so intense for 6 months isn't it .... I think next year I'm going to tone national final season down a bit.
@issavienojums @DennshR I only like it because "it is a song about building bridges"
@EscCro each to their own
@jkp66fi @EscCro @issavienojums #warsfornothing
@EscCro @jkp66fi @issavienojums beaten by San Marino? Dude you are drunk
@EscCro @jkp66fi you can't beat Boggie.
@bbceurovision @ElectroVelvet @TheGNShow @BBCOne @BiancaNicholas @AlexLarke flip him!! Flip him!!!
@EscCro but the eye candy helps me enjoy the song. I don't really like Aussie
@EscCro to be honest it's not his teeth I'm looking at
So tired after today .... All I want to do is get back to the hotel get food and sleep. But at this rate... I'll just sleep.
@EscCro @GuySebastian @JohnKarayiannis how could you? #dead
@EscCro @GuySebastian @MartaJandova @VaclavNoidBarta Czech Republic rule!!!
@EscCro @GuySebastian @TheMakemakes Austria every time
@jkp66fi @issavienojums @EscCro not sure they have that in the arena ... But I can try with my maraaya headphones
Made it to the train to London with 2 minutes to spare..... I may die of a brain aneurysm but at least I'm on the train.
@issavienojums @jkp66fi @EscCro is their a #neither button?
@Arianna483 @Pollaponk @issavienojums of course we are ...There is no escaping #pollaponkDay I think it's the Wednesday I between the semis
I think this is what they call a @issavienojums special #previousTweet
Okay so I've got an hour to get into Hull ... Walk to the grandparents get changed walk back with two suitcases and onto the train to London
@Pollaponk much appreciated ;)
Im happy enough that UK came 7th in #eurojury if only we got this result in Vienna also. Would be a massive success story.
@EurovisionEmily Moldova on 0?? Shame they never got the rely from ukraine  then
@jkp66fi I need a drink now to celebrate :)
On the other hand, I better get looking for a new house #movinghouse
Feeling so happy and blessed right now. The high end designer bought into my ideas and this is going ahead. Very optimistic about the future
I got the contract with the high end fashion designer!!! Now I'm off to get my cases and I'm off to Vienna. Woop! Bring this on!

@megan_dave @BelChi90 well technically I'm just sleeping in Vienna 4 the first 6 days I'll be in Salzburg, prague, Budapest and Bratislava
Kudos for making me late for my important meeting @northernrailorg ... Well that's if the next train isn't cancelled too
So the train has been cancelled ... And I'm sat here like a lunatic waiting for the next one which will make me late...
@megan_dave @BelChi90 well I've got 6 days before my friends arrive so there's plenty of time to be sober.
@megan_dave @BelChi90 to be honest I plan to be drunk for like 10 days straight ... No time to be hungover or sober tbh
I know this is only the second time I've been actually been to #eurovision but actually I couldn't see myself not actually being there
@megan_dave @BelChi90 aww well I shall wave my flag harder scream louder and drink three times as much just because you guys aren't there
@sarah_politics when are we expecting South Hunsley Ward?
Thank you for #millifandom .... What an absolute douchebag ... Just shows what a joke ed really is and the Labour Party is.
@EscCro @issavienojums 
Britain needs a strong labour party.... Yup and even ed realises that doesn't mean him #vote #GE2015

@electrowaffle #labour need conchita
Nick clegg has resigned #vote #GE2015 ... 2 down ... 1 to go
@rgs1997 @electrowaffle second closet election still in the last 20 years... No landslide... But perhaps an upset
This election has been more exciting than the voting in #Eurovision #moscow2009
Wouldn't surprise me if #ukip go for a really young leader now ... But they are still dead as the #BNP
Hmm Nick clegg will speak in 15 minutes .... #vote #GE2015 hello bye to him then
In other news @chrishemsworth is the hung party we all were expecting today ... And @RealHughJackman resigns as wolverine.
And he's ruined it .... #helloBye farage really doesn't know when to stop talking
#farage always finding the positives in life. Kinda love him now #vote #GE2015 but #ukip is dead now

Public jeering of ed Milliband even when he wins.
To be honest Scotland got a great turnout #vote #GE2015
69 votes? Brighton are dirty slags
#conservative defend Brighton
@BelChi90 #conservative turned the heating on ... And we love Europe, so sharing the warmth
Well tbh #libDems shot themselves when they teamed up with #conservative because now they know who can do a better job
@BelChi90 nil point tbh.
@BelChi90 well I'm glad that #conservative won in my constituency ... In fact he slayed
@BelChi90 tbh I would let Scotland go it alone .... And make it hard for them to enter the New UK
@BelChi90 I serious dreamt I woke up to a #labour landslide ... And I wanted to kill myself
@BelChi90 just don't get why they voted no then voted for #snp seems a bit suspect to me
@BelChi90 God are you still up or you been to sleep?
What a great night for #snp to landslide in Scotland. Song guess we'll have another referendum soon then?
#conservative slayed in my constituency with 54% ... Well done David Davis
Just woken up from a nightmare of s labour landslide to find out #conservative have pretty much bagged this for an effective majority #woop
Right I'm going to sleep. I've got a big day tomorrow ... Enjoy the coverage #GE2015 if your staying up
@hanaleakey well it's s large group of town and village none of which are called Haltemprice

@hanaleakey interesting how? I can't talk for Howden as I've never been. But where I am in Haltemprice It's obvious it's a conservative area
@hanaleakey oh are they?? Whereabouts? Yeah it's always David Davis :))
Can tell you now that Haltemprice &amp; Howden (my constituency) will be #conservatives ....
Why do people think there is a difference between the #bNP and #UKIP one just spins the racism better than the other
Going to bed after Newcastle ... #vote #GE2015
@BelChi90 @megan_dave viva la Europe
@PeteJLewis well the country will be sorted out in 5 years so we won't need to blame other people outside our country
@BelChi90 @megan_dave tbh I wouldn't be surprised if #ukip won something around the hull area. Kinda why I hate living so close to the city
@PeteJLewis BNP never did this well though. It's actually quite scary
@BelChi90 something you find in the Labour Party .... Cheap. Give me David Davis and his Sass anyday <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>🏼
@rgs1997 ya'll seem so foreign to me at the minute.
Gosh I'm bored of these labour areas in the north area .... Let them join Scotland #vote #GE2015
Is this dude drunk? #vote #GE2015
Sunderland west ... #vote #GE2015 #ukip are doing so well ... I feel so sad
@BelChi90 they have students counting ... They are probably playing drinking games every time #ukip got a vote
@BelChi90 next one due in 30 mins
@cin_esc @BelChi90 or I could always just go back to Cyprus ... But it's not the continent
@BelChi90 Baku ;)
@cin_esc @BelChi90 I'm thinking maybe Prague or budapest. Scandinavia is just too expensive ... Although I'd love to live in Copenhagen
@BelChi90 in fact I'll be further away lol
@BelChi90 gladly I shall be moving to the continent soon
@BelChi90 way too many people blaming Europe for our problems #ukip
@electrowaffle gladly I don't live in hull ;)
@electrowaffle they said that in my nearest city ... That even if a paedo stood for labour ... He'd win in hull.
Massive win in Sunderland central then ... Conservatives lost out to UKIP #vote #ge2015
Sunderland central .... Labour again then #vote #GE2015
@electrowaffle we can make some up ;)
God imagine if the #Eurovision votes were this long .... 650 countries voting <NEUTRAL FACE> losing the will to live #vote #GE2015
Tbh whoever wins I won't be living in this country by the end of the parliament anyway so ... #vote #GE2015
If Sunderland South can count in 40 mins why can't everyone else? I'm bored
@electrowaffle false alarm..
@seanbookless oh I missed heard then... It's late ;)
@electrowaffle I really hope he does.... Would really be the best bit of news tonight
@BelChi90 yup.
@BelChi90 hopefully we'll have Newcastle soon.... They were trying to beat Sunderland to first declared ...
@paddys_hat best Twitter account ever... Give it a follow... It might get eaten by paddy ash down live on the bbc #vote #ge2015

Nigel Farage just commented on the #ExitPolls

"Bloody polls, coming here, stealing our jobs"

#TheVote
#GE2…
Well interesting to see that even though yes labour has won Sunderland South .But they still haven't clawed back their 2005 % #vote #GE2015
@rgs1997 bless them
Labour slayed in Sunderland South then ... Nothing interesting here .... #vote #GE2015
Result time in Sunderland South #vote #GE2015

@rgs1997 @BelChi90 I'm in the north east too ;)
@eurovicious @stingovision @berlinerchris she has to admit she has a problem before she cares and that could take another 5 years
@eurotwintrees @w12plive I gave up. EV deserved better than that
@BelChi90 @rgs1997 can you believe these exit polls? Hope in SNP tbh
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
The SNP have won every seat except 1?? Jesus!!  #exitpolls I suppose were having another referendum on independence then
CON up 9 to 316
LAB down to 239
SNP every seat in Scotland except 1 LIB DEMS down from 57 t…
Use exit polls can not be true ... Surely??!!
That's it folks .... Our next prime minister has been chosen .... Let's get counting whilst I sleep. <SLEEPING FACE>
@w12plive I think I actually prefer Amanecer is better than Dancing in the rain.
@DimiSpice85 @w12plive I pretty much hate remixes though.
@Maikeeel @joanaplucas Marco <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> #ohyes #voteMarco
@w12plive Amanecer is actually a song I really love but I never seem to listen to it much .... But that might be a good thing when in Vienna
@joanaplucas @Maikeeel well it's probably going to win the #ogaePoll
@Maikeeel @joanaplucas I didn't like Songu so I hope it does a lot better
@Maikeeel @joanaplucas its definitely a top 5 song
15 minutes people .... If you haven't voted do so now ... Get running to that polling station. #vote #GE2015
@ebackfish thanks for the info. I'll check it out after Vienna ;)
Even I am quite shocked that people can't appreciate a great French ballad @w12plive
@w12plive I am so over Australia already .... And yup we all know they will be back next year regardless <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
@ebackfish do you stream your show over the Internet? It sounds really interesting.
@w12plive Omg so happy you played Jan Johansen ... So excited to see him at Euro fan cafe. #GlensMumForPrimeMinister
Well seeing as Elnur only won @osesturkiye in February and now he's off to #eurovision I hope we get an album after @lnrhsynv
@w12plive Belarus baby!!!! #ILoveBelarus easily their best song, deserves top 5 for sure #GlensMumForPrimeMinister
@w12plive #GlensMumForPrimeMinister would actually hilarious
@w12plive Traffic light ... 100% better than her two Eurovision entries
Oooh thanks for the reminder ... I need to download Lena's traffic light song before I go tomorrow. I actually do love this song @w12plive
@w12plive I wonder if we can get #glensmum #GlensMumForPrimeMinister trending on general election night?

@EscCro @dollystylemusic @issavienojums during the day?
@EscCro @dollystylemusic @issavienojums why not Sunday?
@kyliewilson at first I thought it was the rag and bone man ... Then I realised it was just David Davis haha
@kyliewilson did it come with a recorded message too?
@kyliewilson like this? Haha 
Never thought I'd be jealous of lance bass ... But sleeping @Andy I guess it's time to succumb
@anotherESCfan I think maybe a illegal immigrant sneaked inside
Okay my suitcase just broke my scales .... This is not a good sign
@shambletina reminds me of. Birmingham to be honest. But I can't wait to see it
#Eurovision here I come. Stage looks amazing can't wait to see it in real life next week. 
Can't wait to get this whilst in Vienna #eurovision programme.

@kyliewilson allowed to do what? Take a pic? I didn't bother to ask <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Poland ... Another possible winner of the final <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #copenhagen2014
Okay so I have big pile of clothes I'm taking to Vienna with me .... Of which only half is going to fit in the suitcase....
I kind of feel like I've only actually seen this semi final once before. #copenhagen2014
The weiner takes it all hahahaha love the extra long plugging of conchita here #copenhagen2014
The audience are absolutely going wild for conchita. This was just so crazy #copenhagen2014
I love still calling @Softengineband by the French version as heard on @bbceurovision #classic
And now Tijana has her glasses on ..... Shame on you Tijana. #copenhagen2014
#RiseUp cats <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #copenhagen2014
Tick the blue box for goodness sake. Please don't ruin our growing economy.
The award has to go for the dancing bin man from Sweden though #copenhagen2014
I love the #joinUs dance .... Best act of the night .... Haha just remembered @glenbartlett on stage <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> shaking what mama gave him
Oh Jessica Mauboy kindly go back to Australia please #copenhagen2014
Oh no, car crash performance goes to Australia ... Of course #copenhagen2014

Hashtag shut up #copenhagen2014
Ovi and Paula ..I had such high hopes for this song. I do love it but was so disappointed with the staging and performance. #copenhagen2014
Slovenia - I'm really not sure how I feel about this song. Sometimes I love it sometimes I'm just meh to it. #copenhagen2014
Greeces worst entry ever .... #copenhagen2014
Tbh Tijana's vocals were pretty piss poor #copenhagen2014
Macedonia ... Great song ....  But where are your glasses???? Biggest mistake ever to grace Eurovision stage #copenhagen2014
So excited that 3 of these dancers will be back on stage in Vienna. #Belarus #copenhagen2014 #cheesecake
@issavienojums tbh I didnt have time to be missing Teo tbh. #belarusFTW
Belarus!!!  Oh yeah! cheesecake is love. #copenhagen2014 cheesecake is life.
@iamRamad0n British Airways have always been the best for me. And the air miles are a good incentive to stay
@issavienojums well I liked the Irish song ..... Until I saw her performance I was like <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE> Jesus and we still have it 5 points
Ireland- Fighting with Georgia for biggest car crash of the evening. I love the song but this performance is just terrible. #copenhagen2014
@issavienojums quite why I didn't go during Ireland I will never understand tbh.
@issavienojums I saw the middle and end <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@iamRamad0n Cathay Pacific is supposed to be ones of the best aren't they?
And now for Finland .... Actually this is better than I remembered it being. #copenhagen2014
@iamRamad0n who is bad? #nameAndShame
Quite surprised this came 11th ... Although at least it was quite some margin with 10th ... The best thing about it if the guy dancer is hot
The moment they chose Attention .... The moment they chose not to qualify. This is quite bad #copenhagen2014
Lithuania umbrellas are cute #copenhagen2014
And there we have it .... The winner. Hear them roar. #copenhagen2014 the audience actually went wild for her.
Time for Conhita to slay!!!! #copenhagen2014
All the gays screaming over these slutty slavics is actually hilarious #copenhagen2014
Time for Poland ... Tbh I hated this when I saw it at the arena. But actually it's quite fun in retrospect. #copenhagen2014
@issavienojums @EscCro and politely applaud ... You did ask for classy.
Tbh what were Georgia thinking with this song?? Biggest car crash going #copenhagen2014
@EscCro terrible
@issavienojums @EscCro time and place. I would presume you wouldn't be screaming fan girl at opera.
And Georgia ....... Oh ffs. This is just terrible. #copenhagen2014 love the wine flag though. Could play pingpong wine with that
Silent Storm is actually such a beautiful song #copenhagen2014
@issavienojums @EscCro #prepareYourself
And here comes Norway ... Tbh this was staged amazingly. #copenhagen2014
@issavienojums @EscCro next time I will push you on stage tbh
The stage is just too big for her. She hasn't got enough going on. #copenhagen2014 #israel
@issavienojums @EscCro there was just no time to drink. I was pretty dehydrated on front row
Israel .... Oh god I don't think I can watch this big injustice. I love this song. I feel like crying already #copenhagen2014
Malta have to qualify. I was always scared for them being on first. But it's a short semi. Only 15 songs #copenhagen2014
@KurtCalleja still so young.
@issavienojums @EscCro get over it and just go with the flow. I'm sure Paddy wouldn't have pulled you on stage, but it would have been fun:)
First up ... Malta. This is actually a great song, and they were amazing at Euro Fan Cafe. Go Malta! #copenhagen2014
So many great songs in this semi final. But some really bad ones too. *cough cough* #Georgia #Ireland
Hej @NikolajKoppel doesn't get boring watching him on #eurovision <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
FYI electroFolk should have won in Latvia ... This violin is amazing 
@EscCro @issavienojums his heart was broken because she didn't scream ... Instead tried to hide. Breaking his heart ... He don't understand
Every time I see a violin I want to get mine out the loft. #copenhagen2014
Haha I love the stampede of #Eurovision fans stopping traffic in Copenhagen. Yup that pretty much sums up #Eurovision week
Semi final 2 #eurovision #copenhagen2014 god I was so drunk during this one.
@issavienojums @EscCro @KristaSiegfrids @romanyuta neither did you. You rejected him. His heart was <BROKEN HEART>
Okay so I promised myself that I would watch #copenhagen2014 before I fly to Vienna. ... So here I come SF2
Am I the only one who actually loves this stage? #Vienna2015 #eurovision

Actually so tempted to wait for @UzariAndMaimuna at the airport with my big Belarusian flag. May 10th right?
I'm going to draw the #eurovision heart and colour in the Azerbaijan flag then. #baku2016 
@issavienojums @DennshR better get finding a Viennese guide to strip clubs then ;)
@issavienojums @DennshR I'll go and pick it up for you then ;)
@DennshR @issavienojums it said "this is your chance to meet Elnur" so I guess so
@DennshR tbh im just trying to win ticket for @issavienojums of course I want to meet him though when I pick it up ;)

"If you don't vote - Don't Complain!"  <CROSS MARK>

@benpalmer91 has to be the one on your polling card.
@issavienojums @EurovisionDude you are Cyprus delegation or at least you can sneak inside, in their pants <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>

@EurovisionDude @issavienojums she might change her mind when she hears that Måns will be there... Perhaps for that 30 mins anyway ;))
@DennshR I was being sarcastic .... I already sent
@issavienojums at least we got the Turkish version
Do they want my disbelief selfie now?? 
I can't believe of all the songs he sang tonight .... He didn't sing #hourOfTheWolf .... <NEUTRAL FACE><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
@jkp66fi just praying for #baku2016
Anyone shaking their booty to this party dance grunge? #hourOfTheWolf @lnrhsynv
Oh he's singing Latch ... I love this song #hourOfTheWolf @lnrhsynv
You mean he is actually going to sing?? Thank god for that #hourOfTheWolf
There's a new use for selfie sticks .... #hourOfTheWolf
Elnur is on stage finally #hourOfTheWolf
@issavienojums well we might just have a different song now ..... Or just another remix :-//
They need to play something else .... Im getting quite bored of This song already.
I hope everyone is joining in with @lnrhsynv #WolfSelfies #TeamWolf #hourOfTheWolf 
@BelChi90 @Harriet_ESC mainly just compulsory participation in Eurovision if you are in the European zone...
@BelChi90 @Harriet_ESC haha I should start the #Eurovision party.... We have important EU issues
#prayForBaku
@EscCro @jkp66fi @KristaSiegfrids waiting and wishing and praying
@jkp66fi @KristaSiegfrids @EscCro I hope to see her again. One of my favourite all time performers at esc
@jkp66fi @KristaSiegfrids @EscCro I don't think fan cafe asked her :-( shame as she was the best thing about the fan cafe last year
@jkp66fi @KristaSiegfrids @EscCro although I presume that means she won't be in Vienna :-( #DivorceMeBaby
@jkp66fi @KristaSiegfrids @EscCro @yle_musiikki @AinoTollinen @cristal_snow @laurahaimila yup exciting news isn't it ...
Got myself a little something something for #Vienna moi je ne sais qoui if you will 8-D
@AstroCaitlin cool were doing it the day ponk will be there
@AstroCaitlin @Pollaponk @Eurovision for the final?
@AstroCaitlin @Pollaponk @Eurovision what day are you guys doing #PonkDay ? Or going for PonkWeek? Were doing it too lol
@PeteJLewis hand the qualification over to Hungary please ;)
@Maikeeel hahaha yeah I did love the twirl .... But it didn't save the performance. He is so cute but he looks so weird on stage
@GabbygalEvs
Macedonia are pulling out the big ones putting black street on stage .... So cool @Kay_Makovsky I still hope you wear your yellow shoes ;)
@Maikeeel I swear if he pulls the same shit in Vienna and then it qualifies over something I like .... Belgium is dead to me
@PeteJLewis and it's the biggest non song of the year. Ladies and gentlemen ...: this years fan wank award goes to ....
@PeteJLewis it really was a train wreck. It was like so what kind of performance do you want to be?
@Maikeeel I actually thought it was rubbish. Locked the charm of the video. And why so many people on stage? Should be trialling out 6
Am I the only one who thought Loic's performance was anything BUT stunning?
@LoreenatorDK @TimWalksAlong omg!!  I hope it's sergej... I miss his cute face
#ogaeUk party at the euro fan cafe on Thurs 21st 5-7? Pretty sure most of us if not all will be in the queue at the arena.
Another former artists to present votes this time it's @KristaSiegfrids #dingDong
@KristaSiegfrids we want you in Vienna?!!!
I'm giving the finnish votes esc lovers!!!! <FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS> #esc
To be quite honest I don't really get Rhythm Inside .... And his performance on the voice was just .. Weird.
Jesus! So he either practised or he tried it earlier but was interrupted. This is some scary shit 
3 days until I'm on the way to Vienna. How exciting!! #Eurovision
I am sing so hard for polina in Vienna.... Sing soooo hard I will shine. #AMillionVoices
The fact that polina is only singing about 1 million voices is the most pathetic criticism I've ever heard.
Mapping routes from apartment to Eurovision village, euro fan cafe and wiener stadhalle .... It's nearly time.
@lnrhsynv farewell party tonight... Woop!
@shining_nick you should ... Hilary needs your vote <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
@shining_nick I know who I'm voting anyway
@shining_nick thanks ... Didn't really work though. The top 3 parties basically drew
@shining_nick link me?
Well Serbia chose the wrong song Too... Should have sent Danica. 17 mins in and that's Serbia done haha
The cheap dress projection has been Serbia ... Hope they aren't going to pull this shit in Vienna. #OZB
Tbh Suze Za Kraj would have been staged beautifully #OZB
Danica Krstic was also great #OZB
Aleksa Jelic was pretty spectacular ... #OZB
I might as well get Serbia national final in before bed seeing as there is only three songs ... #OZB
@DennshR we had it on Sunday and I had a cheeky sing as I was walking home in it.
Can't deal with people who don't know what they are talking about....
@shining_nick the chorus is the best bit
I swear to god if I see another "non celebrity" advertising coco white teeth whitening on Twitter I might actually explode.
Wonder how many times I can use this in Vienna ? @Alastair_JB thanks ;) 
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@Alastair_JB haha ... Feel free to stroke it then <SMIRKING FACE>
Well Molly didn't slay .... They should have chosen Erika. Shame on you #eurosong
@blanketperson thanks Mr.... Hopefully will be gone for Saturday when I fly. Or at least be ready to leave behind
@Alastair_JB bless your follow. But no manner of cute smiles will help me vote for labour on Thursday <SMIRKING FACE><KISSING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
And now time for Molly .... I hope she slays otherwise I'm going to be angry that Ireland picked this song #eurosong
@blanketperson a little bit .... Still pretty much in bed. The antibiotics have certainly worked. Still got another week of them to kick it
God considering I have hardly eaten anything for a week I hope I've lost some weight ready for Vienna. I need room for beer :))
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I can't  
Although I agree ... The aim high notes have the potential to make a car crash of you. #Eurosong nice song though
Jesus this panel are brutally honest aren't they? #Eurosong poor Nikki kavanagh
@goaround99 @ssami_ @DennshR you are drunk or what not.
@issavienojums as are you .... Doddy <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>*facepalm* btw did you find a studio version?
@ssami_ @goaround99 @DennshR I decide on either wolf or always as my number 1 after the contest
@NinniLumi @mh1986esc rug munching faggots ... Boy what a paradox
@goaround99 best use of a plastic box I've ever seen
Time for Nikki Kavanagh ... #Eurosong
@goaround99 hold me was great ... Staging was awesome
@issavienojums hahaha would have been perfect ... Aww I love it , I wouldn't have supported groupie had this been in melfest <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
@issavienojums wonder why they couldn't get into #melfest
@goaround99 wait are you on about break me up? Or hold me?
@issavienojums I actually LOVE break me up.
@goaround99 @DennshR @ssami_ hold me is my third fav Azeri song. Behind hour of the wolf and always
@DennshR @ssami_ but you ranked it above start a fire <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE> *facepalm*
I am utterly obsessed with Break Me Up already .... Why didn't Ireland send this?? The key change is LOVE, the key change is LIFE
@DennshR @ssami_ I utterly shocked you ranked hold me last
#skandiIrishPop this is the way they should have gone #Eurosong
Erika selin - break me up Brilliant song, exactly what Ireland should have sent to #Eurovision #Eurosong you can so tell its Swedish though
@issavienojums they should have chosen the Swedish one #Eurosong
@issavienojums shoulder song wasn't that bad .... I was expecting something truly terrible. And it came 2nd?? #eurosong
@bg_eurovision @TimWalksAlong we will hope you will be there too
Here we go .... Anybody got a shoulder ... <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> #Eurosong
@TimWalksAlong bored?? We're at the peak of the season nearly.
Austria tried rap and it didn't work??? How very dare you diss trackshittaz #eurosong
Oh poor Alex Saint .... This panel is just butchering him. I liked the chorus .It had a hook But yeah would have been a car crash #eurosong
She's so fine ..... Shouldn't have bothered #eurosong
@TimWalksAlong @bg_eurovision Jesus, let's concentrate on Vienna first ... Then yes I can start planning to go to Sofia haha
@TimWalksAlong @bg_eurovision depending on budgets for Sofia .... But yes I really hope they do return
Ireland trying something different? Didn't they try that with dustin the turkey? And look how they turned out #Eurosong
@TimWalksAlong @bg_eurovision I hope they return in 2016 but I think it's more to do with #sofia2015
Linda Martin calling someone a gobshite on live TV ... Ahaha brilliant #Eurosong jesusni wish I watched last year
Ireland's relationship with the Eurovision is just like the UK...not taken seriously anymore #eurosong
Yes the RLAP is a great song, great performance and great staging ... But it wouldn't have won without Conchita. #Eurosong
@BiancaNicholas @celinedion good omen ... But how crazy is that??
Linda Martin is pretty hilarious #eurosong
Win number 8? I very much doubt it Ireland #eurosong
This is going to be a long 2 hours when I don't really like the Irish accent #eurosong
@Schafernaker <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> poor cat.
Love the fact that Ireland are singing UK Eurovision songs ...: what because they don't have anything decent themselves?? #Eurosong
Time for Ireland Eurosong ..::: and its Niamh <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Well I loved all but Doddy in #eurovisionCY bravo Cyprus ... Now come back with something spectacular next year please
Giannis was flawless #eurovisionCY
Time for Giannis KaraGiannis... He looks so sweet without a beard ...  It thank god he grew one. #eurovisionCY
@shambletina black widow
@EwanESC Thanks for the reminder.  I need to dig mine out from last summer.
Minus One would have slayed in Vienna. #eurovisionCY
Considering I'm not a huge fan of rock in #Eurovision .... I actually quite liked shine - minus one #eurovisionCY
Without your love.... What a beautiful song #EurovisionCY
Italy just won the day ... 4 lots of 12 points in #ogaePoll
I was told to watch out for Doody.... And now I just want to die... #magic #eurovisionCY
Omg I love hovig from Cyprus #EurovisionCY if only he had a better song .... Although this one isn't too bad.
Hovig is hot!!! #eurovisionCY
Get this Heidi bitch off my screen #eurovisioncy fillipa bark just got good,
First up are the judges singing us a lovely little song #eurovisioncy
Okay so it's time for #Cyprus Eurosong project... Let's see if there's anything decent for the playlist ...
@RuslanaOfficial ready to spread Ukrainian love in Vienna at #Eurovision #prayForUkraine shine your lights 4ukraine 
@issavienojums soooo much to do soooo little time, and I've got to find time to vote In between mine too.
@issavienojums out when we all arrive...
@issavienojums battle cries never gonna change the fact that whilst we're at arena they need to sell beer... And they will hardly chuck them
@issavienojums I blame all these warrior songs.
@escXtra scorchio scorchio scorchio!!
@issavienojums oh no!! I trust you can finish it by next Friday ;p
@issavienojums but worry about it when it happens is all I ask. Otherwise it's just #warsForNothing
@issavienojums did you finish your playlist for Vienna?
Love that people have time for pointless drama .... I for one ain't got time for that.
Why is everyone crying over spilt milk even before it's been spilt?
Well of course Bulgaria is going to be broadcasting #Eurovision ... They want to keep the interest ready for tickets sales for #jesc
@kyliewilson bought the coolest ever longline shirt from there. Bringing it to Vienna actually so you'll see ;)
@kyliewilson Asos are usually quite good. You'll have it by the weekend.
@kyliewilson I use Asos a lot though. Kinda bored of the same old stuff in the town shops.
@kyliewilson I did most of mine online .... So much easier and less stress. I hate shopping on a weekend.
@kyliewilson is this for ponkday?
My final batch of flags came today #Ukraine 
@katerinaalice make sure you listen to Azerbaijan <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
The last five minutes of the film United 93 are brutal ... So much courage to those on board. <CRYING FACE>
@EscCro @BelChi90 these two young Tories look like they party every night <WINKING FACE>
Glad to know that it's going to be in the mid 20s in Vienna next week. Turn for some sun and heat #vienna2015
@EscCro @BelChi90 it's time for a sexy party #erectionDay #VoteConservative #ELECTION2015 
@EscCro @novimedijiHRT *shakes head* <PENSIVE FACE>
@EscCro @novimedijiHRT I guess it's a no for 2016 then
@GerryGreek what the hell was Rihanna thinking?
@EscCro @novimedijiHRT #ShameOnCroatia
@EscCro @novimedijiHRT they are no longer airing vienna2015?
Can @EscCro confirm or deny that @novimedijiHRT have removed Eurovision from their schedules?
@AlexLarke @BiancaNicholas hopefully I'll get to the hotel at Heathrow in time. I shall be flying to Vienna on Saturday morning
@AlexLarke @BiancaNicholas is it graham norton chat show this Friday? Im hoping I'll be able to watch before I fly to Vienna
@ElectroVelvet @grahnort @BBCRadio2 @AlexLarke is our very own dick van dyke being a one man band, don't you think @BiancaNicholas?
@issavienojums @Johanna7r well this is about 9/11 so it's not so unrealistic .... If I'm gonna go i'm gonna go.
@issavienojums @Johanna7r @Eurovisionista mucho love. Make sure she votes Belarus in semi 1 then
@issavienojums @Johanna7r I'll each it after I've finished watching this film about a plane crash - wise move 3 days before my flight
@issavienojums @Johanna7r @Eurovisionista okay she is forgiven for having azerbajinjin there
@Johanna7r @issavienojums see craptastic is my favourite genre ;)
@issavienojums @Johanna7r I'll look forward to that one too then.
@Johanna7r @issavienojums @Eurovisionista I did love it when it was chosen. But stranger things can happen: preferring something over Bogie
@issavienojums @Johanna7r @Eurovisionista Australia?? She is dead to me
@Johanna7r @issavienojums @Eurovisionista well I don't find Iceland that boring tbh just a bit meh
@issavienojums @Johanna7r @Eurovisionista if she loves Cyprus she will donate it <SMIRKING FACE>
@issavienojums @Johanna7r @Eurovisionista ... Because the songs I hate lose over them
@issavienojums @Johanna7r @Eurovisionista boring is one thing ... But hate is another. My boring songs have made it as high as 30 ....
@Johanna7r @issavienojums @Eurovisionista in going to watch the Cypriot final today. See if they made the right choice ;) of course they did
@issavienojums @Johanna7r @Eurovisionista hmm worth a shot I guess. App voting on the wifi
@issavienojums @Johanna7r @Eurovisionista In fact I probably have a spare UK SIM card .. But you'd have to bring the iPhone 5 haha
@Johanna7r @issavienojums @Eurovisionista I've not really heard hate for Cyprus since #balladgate back when it was selected.
@Johanna7r @issavienojums @Eurovisionista not really sure how the app vote works as UK doesn't use it.
@Johanna7r @issavienojums @Eurovisionista how does the app voting work? Will it record that your in Austria? Or still recognise you're Dane
@Johanna7r @issavienojums @Eurovisionista surely no one can hate on Cyprus??
@issavienojums @Johanna7r @Eurovisionista build some bridges and buy a UK SIM card ;)
@issavienojums @Johanna7r @Eurovisionista why can't you vote?
@Johanna7r @issavienojums @Eurovisionista I think they actually will. It's just one of those simple sweet songs which gets through.
To be honest I want @JohnKarayiannis to win #Eurovision with DiggiLoo DiggiLey #cyprus  
@issavienojums @Eurovisionista I hope Greece call their votes first.... Then this will become a reality. ;)
Cyprus just made it to my top 5 <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR> #Eurovision
@Eurovisionista 1. Azerbaijan 2. Belarus 3. Russia 4. Italy 5. Cyprus
I'm pretty sure that watching United 93 three days before I get on a plane is a bad idea.... But I'm going to do it anyway.
I think I'm in love <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> #diggiloodiggiley 
And now I've lost my voice... Oh god this is fun
Insomnia insomniaaaaaa
@issavienojums @NikolausRLD @shining_nick yeah weird... I just read "No registration is possible. Just pay on the day" and presumed.
@issavienojums @NikolausRLD @shining_nick it says pays when you get there....
Wow... We've got Conchita coming to the opening night of euro fan cafe <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ bring on Vienna.
@EscCro @issavienojums @euro_pete was their a really bad euroclub mix of Joan franka you and me in London? Like butchered?
@issavienojums @NikolausRLD @shining_nick how much is the tour?
@issavienojums @NikolausRLD @shining_nick I'm sure this will be doable
@NikolausRLD @issavienojums @shining_nick I'll ask when I get there. It doesn't mention any luggage storage on the website
@issavienojums @EscCro @euro_pete tbh yes it was unbelievably overplayed in Amsterdam.
@issavienojums @NikolausRLD @shining_nick well as long as I don't have to walk around with my two suitcases yup.
@EscCro @euro_pete it's always been special to me.
@EscCro @euro_pete best time to listen and dance to it.
@issavienojums @NikolausRLD @shining_nick errm well the hotel will look after the luggage until 12..But aren't we meeting the others before?
@EscCro @euro_pete it's basically everyone... I haven't met anyone yet that likes it... Even you at melfest wasn't keeeeeen.
@euro_pete @EscCro everyone I meet is hating on it,
@issavienojums @NikolausRLD @shining_nick ugly tour?
@issavienojums @NikolausRLD @shining_nick @mr_gerbear @Arianna483 we need to take the others to the condom museum tbh
Can't wait to hear @JohnKarayiannis diggi-loo diggi-ley single tomorrow. :)) jegElsker
@issavienojums @EscCro I love 2008 ... In my all time top 10. And 2009 is nice.
@issavienojums @EscCro lol and Tristan called it a night after it too... #hellobye Iceland one step at a time.
@issavienojums @EscCro as for axel ...only the chipmunk version improves it 
@issavienojums @EscCro the Iceland remix is when I had had enough tbh. I don't mind the original song but by god the pulled a Malta on that
@EscCro I think the fact that SHOULDNT is a bigger question. They can mix anything t make sound worse.
@EscCro Amber: warrior (Malta 2015) Trijintje: walk along .... (Netherlands 2015)Axel hirous: mother (Belgium 2014) it's actually quite easy
@euro_pete @EscCro so much hate out here though for nadav
@KurtCalleja @ConchitaWurst where can we get one ?
Game over ... No restart
@EscCro the location of Amsterdam afterparty was great. Lovely place... And great for Euro fab cafe ;) if ever they need one in Netherlands
@EscCro and London was okay. But too many crappy euro club mixes of crappy songs
@EscCro melfest after party for music and dancing ... There was too many people at Amsterdam after party it was like sardines
@EscCro @NadavGuedj I have golden shirt and golden tie too ... Originally for Amsterdam but I never wore
@EscCro @NadavGuedj I shall be there dancing my socks off. Golden socks and golden herreys shoes
@EscCro @NadavGuedj yes yes yes #GoldenBoy
Well for hungary I rank Adam Szabo before Boggie ... But my love for Boggie will never fade #ADal2015
And here is hungarys warrior #ADal2015
Passed - mesmerize..... Is she singing you make me flew? Like for real???? #ADal2015
Oh and Kati Wolf was just standard .... Kind of ruined by the fact you know it would have been translated into English #ADal2015
So I loved Adam Szabo even more than Boggie ... Can it be?? #ADal2015
@anotherESCfan @issavienojums three if we find her in Vienna.
#ogaepoll No UK votes for Azerbaijan? I need to find a new Ogae.
@issavienojums and now you are your own worst enemy when it comes to eduard
Now for spoon .... How boring #ADal2015 next
@issavienojums well I didn't like it first hear but at least I didn't hate on her.
@issavienojums that would be so magical. Imagine if she used some footage of the flashmobs as video backdrop <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
How could anyone hate on Boggie??? She's so sweet #ADal2015
Haha all these people walking on stage joining in on #warsForNothing I half expect to see @issavienojums and I walk on and singing with her
God I love #WarsForNothing so much. #ADal2015
Oh I love this staging as people walk on flashmob style joining her. I hope she does this in Vienna #ADal2015 #WarsForNothing
Time for Boggie .... She loves hugging doesn't she and she's such an emotional girl #warsForNothing
Gajer balint up first ... Not bad. But Jazz at Eurovision I don't like .... Unless it's electro jazz ;)
Watching Hungary #ADal2015 let's see if there's anything decent to add to my playlist
@issavienojums fingers in too many pies
@issavienojums yeah only just around to listening to it lol
@ESCSamuel first time i heard it
WTF ... their previous song exactly like Groupie in the verses @issavienojums 
Getting so excited to see Jan Johansen at the euro fan cafe :)) #eurovision60
@jkp66fi I did already ... But thanks. Haha let's dance to Bandido in celebration:
@jkp66fi nice choice.... My birth year
One of my favourite UK #eurovision entries has to be @sam_Womack #AMessageToYourHeart #eurovision60 
@EscCro @Pollaponk I will bring them in case we go in Donau on donausiel
I've become obsessed with Toto Cutugno Insieme lately 
Do @Pollaponk go swimming on #pollaponkDay ? @EscCro 
@victor_cat_96 we will find you. We know where you will be ... Or watching may 23rd ;))
@victor_cat_96 you will be trialled for treason  if your not careful
@victor_cat_96 the new baby will never get to the throne unless George never has kids?
@BelChi90 it's truly an amazing show. #GetOutOfMyClub .... Coming next "I'm going to blacklist you from my club" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@victor_cat_96 I'll go for millionaire husband life tbh
What's the  #MENGONIGAME ?
@victor_cat_96 single life is the easiest life
OMG this girl is sooooo drunk ... What an air head. #millionaireMatchmaker enjoy the single life bitch
@EscCro Charlotte Perelli Elizabeth Andersson Diana Gurtskaya (all three actually)
... But for me. It's a no.
... "I'm a golden boy" ... "This is how we do it" over a typical everyday Ibiza drenched backing track then your in for a treat....
Just heard the new remix to golden boy... Truly terrible. If you want to remix that sounds nothing like the original except the random....
@EscCro princess conchita has been renamed Charlotte Elizabeth Diana. #RoyalBaby #RoyalBabyGirl #RoyalBabyName
@pattistanger needs to come and match me up .... I can show these #millionaires how it is done.
Ha! An Italian who doesn't speak Italian ... Yet was a quality Patti was looking for in these polish girls. Classic #epicFail #millionaire
Hahaha millionaire matchmaker today "are you polish? Because you look polish" followed by "will you dye your hair brown? ... No? Sit down"
28 year old married man looking to experiment ...:: oh fuck off
This time last year I was on my way to #Copenhagen2014 for #Eurovision
@EscCro @hrtvijesti @TheVoiceCroatia meh she's no winner
@EscCro @hrtvijesti @novimedijiHRT Zagreb 2017
Can @EscCro confirm or deny that Croatia will return to #Eurovision in 2016 and send the winner of @TheVoiceCroatia
Iceland through ... And their reaction is great. #copenhagen2014  so sad for Portugal and Estonia though.
Axel sat there praying ... Possibly to his mother #copenhagen2014
I can hear me screaming for San Marino :D Woop!
The boos for Russia .... Fuck you!! #copenhagen2014
Jon ola sand "I like you lise ..." God what a creep. #copenhagen2014 but at least he's a hot creep
Haha the giant mermaid xxxxx #copenhagen2014
@issavienojums Albania tipped the scale for me
@issavienojums and sucked more than mother or wild soul? Impossible.
@issavienojums I changed my vote <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
Why am I missing this??? #marcoMagic  
And Latvia wins over Russia basically for what it has represented after the contest. #YouGotToUniteEurope with Cake to bake #copenhagen2014
top 10 sF 1 #copenhagen2014 1. Sweden 2. Armenia 3. Estonia 4. San Marino 5. Portugal 6. Ned 7. Montenegro 8. Ukraine 9. Iceland 10. Latvia
@issavienojums to be honest I could easily swap it for Russia ...
@issavienojums who did I forget? Latvia? Marginal 11th <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
The ugly ducking dance... #bored #copenhagen2014
top 10 sF 1 #copenhagen2014 1. Sweden 2. Armenia 3. Estonia 4. San Marino 5. Portugal 6. Ned 7. Montenegro 8. Ukraine 9. Iceland 10. Russia
<SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY> 
@EurovisionEmily water was amazing!!!
@BelChi90 I decided on Portugal over Hungary
I love the staging of Hungary ... But the song is meh #copenhagen2014
My crush of 2014 .... Sergej <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> so cute #copenhagen2014 always loved this song
Although what it came 2nd / 3rd in #esc250 come on CATS isn't that good #copenhagen2014
Netherlands now .... CATS ... Visually stunning. What a surprise: but thinking back you can see why it did so well #copenhagen2014
@TimWalksAlong you won't. You will barely qualify if you ask Me.
@BelChi90 our bank holidays are always Monday's lol
@BelChi90 no not Friday .... Our May Day is moved to the Monday.
@BelChi90 it's basically the same as May Day.
@TimWalksAlong quite why the Dutch love walk along but hated on CATS ... I can't
@TimWalksAlong it is. I actually would chose birds over walk along 1000 times.
@BelChi90 it was a hard semi final. Too many good songs
@BelChi90 I was utterly shocked ... Not sure who I would have chosen over her though
@anotherESCfan the land of fire was asleep <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@anotherESCfan <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR> not enough fire in that performance to light a match.
@TimWalksAlong no ... Lol I quite liked the CaTs .... I will hate on Walk along though ;) she's my second last haha
So much love for Suzy. I will never tire of hearing Quero Ser Tua. The biggest travesty of the year - this not qualifying #copenhagen2014
Suzy!! Suzy!! Suzy!! Suzy!! Her flag is amazing #copenhagen2014
@TimWalksAlong oh I see
@TimWalksAlong ... Something which I really love.
@TimWalksAlong you wouldn't mind? Yet you just said you've ranked it second last? I'll be mighlty pissed if my bottom 2 qualify over ...
@arlanda70 oh you can marry him ... I'm not interested in him like that haha
Queen Valentina singing her 3rd best song, I fanboy this so much in Copenhagen. Hear me roar #copenhagen2014
@TimWalksAlong its old fashioned but it's something to dance to ... We were all begging for uptempo and then it just got trashed by many.
@TimWalksAlong oh yeah forgot about them. I wanted them too. But eduard was my 2nd..Moldova is probably my 15th .Don't really get the hate
San Marino baby!!! Following Belgium and Moldova ... No wonders it qualified. #copenhagen2014
@TimWalksAlong at least Moldova chose the best song this year. Not that there was anything else decent
To be honest people are still trying to wash themselves after feeling dirty watching Belgium. #copenhagen2014
And onto Moldova <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE> how? I didn't watch 2014 selection but I do hope this wasn't the best #copenhagen2014
If only he changed the song title to Maria or something.... Actually would have been okay #copenhagen2014
@gutterslush unhealthy relationship with his mother one presumes
He is pretty flawless vocally ... But I just can't ..... The song is beyond creep #copenhagen2014
@arlanda70 me too ... Obviously <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ #baku2016 
Oh god ... Creepy alert #Belgium #copenhagen2014
Shame I didn't get to see Ukraine at village or fan cafe ... If I remember right she had a bad voice #copenhagen2014
Right back onto Ukraine #copenhagen2014 hamster wheel is so random but anything to get my second choice of hot male dancer on stage
What a douchbag
I don't care how eduard gets his hair so glossy .... Next.
@arlanda70 and when the music dies ... Wow but my favourite before wolf came has to be always. Such a tune
@arlanda70 tbh running scared is probably my second least fav :.. But i do like it. It's just the others have just been superb
@issavienojums @iamRamad0n I mean come on calling someone a diva just as your about to interview is not cool or professional.
My least favourite Azerbaijan entry... Didn't deserve to qualify IMO #copenhagen2014
How the hell did she do that Azerbaijan flag like that? That's amazing #copenhagen2014
Well at least they drowned out the boos ...
Time for Russia's bizarre performance ... Love the song though. #copenhagen2014 and for those who are booing right now... Shame on you.
She's singing English but I can hardly understand it... Should have stuck with the Albanian version #copenhagen2014
Time to sleep... Albania <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE> #copenhagen2014
A classic guys night out #copenhagen2014
Jedward <UNAMUSED FACE>
Nikolaj SHOULD wear a Pollaponk suit. #copenhagen2014
Oh poor red ponk... Mic stand falls over and he nearly forgets to pick the mic back up before he has to sing #copenhagen2014
Yellow Pollaponk is so cute with his jiggles #copenhagen2014
Pollaponk!!!!!! Love these guys. #icelandFTW #copenhagen2014
After I saw sanna's performance I thought Jesus, that's a winner #copenhagen2014
The phone torches in the audience look so good. And Sanna just slayyyyyed #copenhagen2014
Sweden .... Was one of my favourites pre and during contest .... I've got special love for #undo #copenhagen2014
Estonia - hot male dancer . CHECK #copenhagen2014
Her vocals are shaky when she is dancing but then with this routine anyone's would be. #copenhagen2014
Estonia next ... Visually stunning #copenhagen2014
A piece of cake!! This is really bad ... But the song is so cute. #copenhagen2014
Time to bake a cake!!! #copenhagen2014
...and they don't get much better.... Studio version is amazing though #copenhagen2014 #armenia
His vocals in the first minute are so weak. #Armenia #copenhagen2014
Up first Armenia .... Never liked this pre or during the contest,,, but now I think it's a masterpiece #copenhagen2014
Oh it's so nice to see nikolaj again. #copenhagen2014
The #joinus video choir is actually breathtaking .... #copenhagen2014
Goosebumps.... And we're in the b&amp;w .... I was there!!!! #copenhagen2014 so much love for this contest.
Love the #joinus choir #copenhagen2014
Lego de forest is sooo cute. #copenhagen2014
Right seeing as I need to watch #copenhagen2014 before Friday... I might as well watch semi 1 now...
@anotherESCfan yes you should be coming to Vienna. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@3urovisionSam will be interesting to see how many 2014 survive then,..
@mh1986esc only Azerbaijan make it on mine.
@mh1986esc like...for real?? Only one will make it on my list
I wonder how many of 2015 songs will make it into #esc250 this year?
@issavienojums @iamRamad0n that's quite some achievement
@EscCro <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@bbuk is big brother on in 8 days?? It's so unfair that I am going to miss it as I'm out of the country for the first week. #bbuk
@iamRamad0n then yes they suck
@EscCro deleted?
@iamRamad0n well depends how old you are lol... Mine is only 4 years out I suppose lol
Jesus... I tried one without a beard from last year and it said I was 36.... Not happy. #HowOldNet 
@blanketperson madness
Happy "may the 4th be with you" to all. Bank holiday goodness to everyone.
Home after a busy day celebrating the baptism of my Friends baby. Celebrations are pretty tiring or am I just getting old?
@EdwardafSillen @NikolausRLD grumpy Danes <SMIRKING FACE>

@shining_nick most excellent. Not long to go then
@shining_nick so I can let you know then. When do you get there?
Great stuff ... It's absolutely chucking it down all day and I need to be out at this christening. This can not be good for my health
@shining_nick I dunno what mine are .... I don't pick them up until I'm in Vienna. I won't pick them up until the 13th
@shining_nick yeh I guess we can queue. I'll be there early anyway. Not sure what the others are doing now <CONFUSED FACE>
@shining_nick @Arianna483 @iamRamad0n you don't want to stand with me? <PENSIVE FACE> I feel hurt
@iamRamad0n @Arianna483 I loved the Albanian version ... But yes for once I preferred the English one.
@EdwardafSillen @NikolausRLD you played a very convincing one though ... ;)
... So I can officially finish my 2015 national final playlist.
So basically I need to watch Hungary Ireland Belarus Albania and Italy national finals all next week before I fly to Vienna....
@EscCro have you not been on #babywatch like everyone else?
@EscCro I tweeted like all day #princessConchita #RoyalBaby #RoyalBabyGirl #RoyalBabyName #RoyalBabyWatch
Well I've officially started my packing ... Shoes flags and toiletries ... And half my suitcase is full ... Fml
@Eurovoix @EurovisionEmily *closes eyes and crosses fingers* hoping and praying for points for Moldova.
Dinah nah just came on shuffle ... And I got rather excited. #melfest #eurovision #lalala
@EurovisionEmily @Eurovoix I wonder if they got any from Ukraine to vote? Think he'll be due some votes from them
When Dana international has to stop you and tell you look like a drunken stripper ...You know it's bad  #eurovision60 
Just reach out and feel the love #dontSayNo
@Eurovoix poor Moldova .... Still no votes.
So apparently I can back from Amsterdam with absolutely no coins?? Because I can not find a single cent #weird
Top 6 #eurovision 
@issavienojums #warsForNothing 
@issavienojums I've got it pinned to my Ukrainian flag at the minute so i don't lose it. But yeah didn't realise I had two

France gave 12 to Armenia .. Must have been drunk #malmo2013
A hella lot of boos for Armenia qualifying #malmo2013

@EurovisionEmily basically slaying the floor
@ShadyEuroFreak @BBCTwo oh I watched that earlier on iplayer. Such a great programme

Are Hungarian cute and meak or something? #malmo2013
Kedvesem <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ I need whatever this guy is high on #malmo2013
@issavienojums <BROKEN HEART>
I'm basically turning into an Azeri .... I tend to not like Armenia every year (except qele qele)
@issavienojums poor girl. The song is beautiful though. And it's her birthday!!!
Yeah Armenia you can just go home please #malmo2013 you basically robbed Israel , so who liked lonely planet?
@issavienojums bad dress but hardly enough to keep her out .... And then Armenia qualifies? #TheresNoGodInTheWorld
It's the royal baby!!! #RoyalBaby #RoyalBabyGirl #RoyalBabyWatch Princess Diana 
@TimWalksAlong jesus
I might actually cry now  ... Israel not qualifying was an even bigger injustice than San Marino. How did this not qualify??!! #malmo2013
@issavienojums I can always support free alcohol.
@TimWalksAlong that goes to 2012 .... I've not liked them since
#AlcoholIsFree the irony of being in Sweden ... Although one day in Copenhagen2014 the alcohol actually WAS free :D
#AlcoholIsFree
Time for Greece... Only saved by the good looking lead singer (not the old guy lol) #malmo2013 I like the message behind this song though
@issavienojums he has a nice beard at least
Can I skip Iceland? Boring!!!! #malmo2013
@johnniew_88 I am very specific in my dating needs haha
Nevertheless this is so much better than the shambles that was kismet #malmo2013 but basically it's a poor mans water
@johnniew_88 I want an authentic Danish sausage salesman for my husband
Oh Bulgaria ...There is just no beating water .... Not sure why they even tried #malmo2013 still I need to see Bulgaria back in this contest
@johnniew_88 oh he's not Danish? I'm no longer interested ;)
Up next ... The cutest doctor ever .... #malta such a sweet song #malmo2013
The hot dog man is hot ... Give me your red sausage #malmo2013
Ahhh Copenhagen!!! :)) #malmo2013
Don't really get the outfits on the backing singers though .... #Finland #malmo2013
@EurovisionEmily yes I do it fuck you <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Krista will be robbed in the final but this is great. Really hope we see her in Vienna this year #malmo2013
@victor_cat_96 @TimWalksAlong @EurovisionEmily oh god that's all I'm going to hear now isn't it?
So over dramatic in the staging .... But it actually makes the song so much better #malmo2013 #Azerbaijan
Azerbaijan!! Farid marry me baby <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> I never really liked this song until I saw the performance #malmo2013 this will be getting my 10 points
@EurovisionEmily @victor_cat_96 oh oops
Macedonia ..... Lozano is soooo cute. I guess I like Macedonians <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> tbh should have stuck with him ...Esma just ruins it #malmo2015
Valentinas vocals were off but I really didn't care.... That should have qualified #malmo2015 not the only one that will be robbed either
To go from the Facebook song to crisalide .... Brilliant. #malmo2015
San Marino .... Queen monetta. I don't think I'll get over crisalide not qualifying #malmo2015 this is just perfection,
@EurovisionEmily oh my god!!! I forgot he dived into the audience... Hahaha he just earned some points from me #malmo2015
Tbh if the Riga beaver sang here we go it would probably my top 10 #malmo2015
@TimWalksAlong nooooo San Marino was her best song that she's entered.... Robbed!!!
Oh Latvia ... One day I hope you will enter a good enough song that will enter my top 10 Still waiting And here we go. #hellobye #malmo2015
@TimWalksAlong which? Lol
@EurovisionEmily oh god... Latvia ... Can I skip? Lol
Not much of a fan of the opening of sf2 #malmo2013
Time to watch semi final 2 #malmo2013
Prince George waving for the cameras outside the hospital is just too cute... I want a baby.
@EurovisionEmily @Kay_Makovsky I really hope Daniel does a gig at Euro fan cafe... I might die ;) #hint

“@Kay_Makovsky: Soon &lt;3 Naskoro &lt;3 #danielkajmakoski #eurosong #eurovision #buildingbridges 
“@Kay_Makovsky: #promotour #eurovision #danielkajmakoski #teamdaniel 
@Kay_Makovsky See you in 7 days fella. #autumnLeaves
@johnniew_88 me neither ... But they soothe my sore throat. Medicinal reasons of course haaha
@DeakinOfficial @EurovisionEmily @TimWalksAlong @BelChi90 @Eurovoix tbh I think I missed blue winning 2011 aswell
I walk all the way to the shop in the cold and wind and I come back with a twister ice lolly ..That's just how I roll 
@EurovisionEmily @DeakinOfficial @TimWalksAlong @BelChi90 @Eurovoix I shall be there. Norway or Azerbaijan for win
@MichaelESC @blanketperson @megan_dave I don't give a feck about #Eurovision haters. They will never deter me. Their opinion means nowt
@megan_dave @shining_nick slutpop = amazing.
@shining_nick @megan_dave he has promised us a show .... Something new. Looking forward to see what he does tbh
@MichaelESC @DimiSpice85 @blanketperson @megan_dave well I think it's a crap song, but it's going through purely because it's AUS
@MichaelESC @megan_dave @blanketperson it needs to evolve though. Just like it always has.
@shining_nick @megan_dave no way will eduard be a car crash. His performance will be flawless
@MichaelESC @DimiSpice85 @blanketperson @megan_dave we all know they would qualify anyway
@MichaelESC @megan_dave @blanketperson if it makes #Eurovision a strong show/contest I don't have a problem with it.
@DimiSpice85 @MichaelESC @blanketperson @megan_dave it was redo the fairest thing to do RE the other semi finalists
@MichaelESC @blanketperson @megan_dave especially when they find out how many new Aussies watched and voted. All about $$$$
@MichaelESC @blanketperson @megan_dave tbh they are waiting for them to win ... Then come back a second year..: then they won't leave
@megan_dave @blanketperson @MichaelESC tbh the 2nd place thing would be a much better idea.
@blanketperson @MichaelESC @megan_dave because I don't like the song
@Eurovoix @DennshR fabrizio <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@NinniLumi oh okay. Lol
@megan_dave @MichaelESC it will do well in Vienna I think. It has a great hook, and will look great on stage. Plus the headphones ...
What happened? 
@megan_dave @MichaelESC is rather Italy win tbh. Although really anyone but Australia
@iamRamad0n is Albanian I'm alive coming out at 2000 CET?
@MichaelESC @megan_dave yeah so far... But no doubt Måns will win this.
#Eurovision #warsForNothing
Oooh!!! A million voices!!!
@MichaelESC @megan_dave err no, the other way around by other people. I don't care who slags who off. Doesn't affect my enjoyment one bit.
@MichaelESC @megan_dave who cares??? #walkAlong
@MichaelESC @megan_dave .... That Pertti and Toni have previously said they love ESC and Schlager
@MichaelESC @megan_dave I think the point is though why jump on their backs and not mention Mans. And disregard the fact that :...
@megan_dave basically they fan wank all over mans face
@AviMayer @AnthonyShaw_ @robbiewilliams @rogerwaters hope Robbie is a golden boy coming to tel aviv. The king of fun 
@issavienojums @DennshR @joanaplucas too true
@EurovisionEmily great promotion for them ... And pleases the punks
Are we thinking it might be Princess Diana ? #RoyalBaby #RoyalBabyGirl #RoyalBabyName #RoyalBabyWatch
@EurovisionEmily that all the other songs are crap .... And Twitter explodes
Crossing my fingers for Princess Conchita #RoyalBaby #RoyalBabyGirl #RoyalBabyName #RoyalBabyWatch
@BelChi90 perhaps I'll get the town crier to announce my respiratory infection. Oh yeah <HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND>🏽
@joanaplucas how very rude of them.
@BelChi90 but a town crier to announce the birth? <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>🏼
Sometimes I think this country is ridiculous  Royal baby: Duchess of Cambridge gives birth to daughter

It's a girl!!! #RoyalBaby #RoyalBabyWatch
Jesus, how is it 11am already?? Even my cat is still asleep.
@EscCro Dana international will be in Vienna ;) 
Aww @boggieofficial flashmob video in #Berlin is too cute 
Why am I not going to Istanbul on Wednesday? Elnur's farewell party before he goes to Vienna. Sadness :-(
@MichaelESC @rioferdy5 truly shocking ... Heart goes out to Rio and the family
@issavienojums @anotherESCfan the best one has to be "there was a cobweb on the outside of the window...and it was still there the next day"
@anotherESCfan but the best one - "they made me so stressed my nose started to bleed"<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
So I'm reading the recent review on the hotel I'm staying at in Vienna... I've got to laugh at some of the most ridiculous ones.
Italy has taken the lead In the ogae poll.... Whoop!!
#RoyalBaby is finally on its way. Boy or a girl? #RoyalBabyWatch
The kid next door has done nothing but cry since 6am ... Ain't nobody got time for this.
@goaround99 @BelChi90 not so cool
@goaround99 @BelChi90 the crab dancers
@Reality_Tim too true
I will never ever believe these are random order ... Saving Netherlands until last <UNAMUSED FACE>
@BelChi90 I guess I am dead to you? Hating Love kills and placing Belarus 6th lol
Belgium qualify .... Like still wtf??!! <UNAMUSED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE>
Robin sterjnberg so damn cuttttttte #malmo2013
Bonnie Tyler #believeInBonnie god there's was so much hype for her

Linda woodruff!!!! If Sweden win this year ... Please have her present in 2016
@issavienojums @hanaleakey if I find a vaclav unfortunately he will have been used .... By me first ;)
The obligatory interpretative dance .... <UNAMUSED FACE> results please
@joanaplucas actually quite a good idea. Not sure if I could do it though. I've got definite favourites now though I skip a lot
@hanaleakey @issavienojums I hope so too. I mean it's Prague and Budapest.... They gotta be ace. Land of Vaclav's and Boggies
@hanaleakey @issavienojums I shall be in Vienna a week tomorrow :))
@hanaleakey @issavienojums yeah I didn't get accredited so I'm off on a mini European tour instead. Travelling from Vienna though.
@issavienojums watching Malmö 2013. But fear not ... Moldova will drop when I get onto Sf2. As I fan boy for Norway :))
@issavienojums @hanaleakey I shall try my hardest in both Prague and Budapest. I have £50 to spend in each city anyway
My sf1 ranking 1. Moldova 2. Ukraine 3. Denmark 4. Estonia  5. Russia 6. Belarus 7. Montenegro 8. Lithuania 9. Ireland 10. Croatia
And Serbia .... Ruined a good enough song with a joke of a show. #malmo2013 .... sF1 is terrible tbh
@hanaleakey @issavienojums I've half packed already :)) woop!!!
I mean who the hell came up with this choreography? They need shooting ... Over and over. #malmo2013 #belgium
@BelChi90 im sorry but this song is terrible as and the dancers just kill it ... Over and over
Oh Belgium ... Belgium, Belgium, Belgium <UNAMUSED FACE> shoot me now. #malmo2013
Cyprus - despina - beautiful, sadly not strong enough to get through #malmo2013
And so begins EBU's fan wank of Australia <UNAMUSED FACE>
Ryan's vocals are so off its unreal but it's actually quite a good song from Ireland. And I guess it's not jedward. #malmo2013
Ryan Dolan - Never really liked this in 2013 ... But now I've grown a crush on him. Plus I guess the drummers were hot #malmo2013
Moldova was so beautifully staged #malmo2013
Pasha at the piano ... The three dancers .... The dress .... Perfection #moldova #malmo2013
@BelChi90 what we would here call a "crank" song - cry wanking. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@BelChi90 snoozefest
My favourite song probably from semi final 1 here we go #Moldova her dress is just so fabulous #malmo2013
Gotta love Belarus. Yet another guilty pleasure #malmo2013
Time for Belarus to camp it up ... #malmo2013 a song about ice Lollys
Did anyone find out why his shoes are called love and pain? #malmo2013
@TimWalksAlong well I suppose you deserved to qualify after all those years you made the effort finally
Time for the shoe song!!!! Andrius is just toooo cute #malmo2013
Where else can you see two dancing men in space suits? #Eurovision #malmo2013 gotta love it
@TimWalksAlong maybe too much wanking at the beginning of the season then. It's very borderline.
Montenegro - now this is where it is at #malmo2013
@TimWalksAlong you are again this year I think ;)
Netherlands - birds.... Biggest fanwank going #malmo2013
Zlata- love this song so much ... But the giant ruined it for me so we're still not onto my winner yet #malmo2013
Here comes Russia with a peace song ... #malmo2013 I guess they didn't actually believe if we if we
The tag line "don't complain it's even more expensive in Norway" would have been perfect
The glitter parade and spark rain ..... Has this song won already? #malmo2013
Or rather piccolo guy ;)
Denmark - there's no denying this is a good song. Sadly it's was never going to be my winner. I love the flute guy though ;) #malmo2013
Croatia - mizerja. I actually like this song, sadly it was undone by what follows #malmo2013
Slovenia - straight into love. My god I loved this song but her vocal ... My god what a car crash #malmo2013
I love Estonia in #malmo2013 its no kuula but it's still a beautiful song
Austria - shine . Quite possibly the most boring song ever let alone of #malmo2013
The children choir singing euphoria ... I guess we've got this coming in Vienna... But singing rise like a Phoenix.
The drunken Irish in fitzgeralds singing euphoria is too funny. The butterflies are just so cute #weareone
Got some housework to do ... So putting on Malmo sF1 probably isn't the best decision.
It's been like 5 days since I got home from London and im just unpacking my bag ... Jesus did I leave any Nutella for @issavienojums ??
@johnniew_88 @issavienojums @EscCro great idea for my next t shirt ;)
@ElectroVelvet @BiancaNicholas @AlexLarke it's here!!! #stillInLoveWithYou 
I must congratulate @redbubble on an amazing t shirt. #TeamWolf is coming to Vienna 
Watch out @lnrhsynv #TeamWolf is coming to Vienna :D #eurovision 
@issavienojums @ssami_ if you lose me ... Just look out for the wolf sign in the sky .... Haha I'm like batman ... :D #azeriDelegation
@johnniew_88 @issavienojums @EscCro Jesus, #PonkDrama I'm not going to be wearing the green outfit for ponk day. I will forever be pinkponk
@ssami_ no stealing!!! I think I might be a unique wearer in Vienna ;)
Oh yeah!!! Vienna here I come! @anotherESCfan #teamwolf @EscCro @issavienojums 
@EscCro my second red bubble t shirt was a lot quicker to come. ;)
@johnniew_88 @issavienojums @EscCro yes I am pink
@iamRamad0n aww one of my favs.... In fact it was favourite year until 2014
@iamRamad0n Serbia did a great job so yeah I hope so.
@DennshR @TimWalksAlong I forget it even more every day .... Like what have they done?
@issavienojums @EscCro don't worry my green outfit is for sleeping in.
@iamRamad0n would be great to see a smaller country host it ... As long as they could fund it sufficiently
@iamRamad0n so it actually could be anyone's at the minute. I guess after semi final 2 we will know.
@iamRamad0n queen conchita lol.... Seriously though I hope Albania do really well. Not sure they will win but I think this years opening up
@iamRamad0n oh please ... Even conchita missed a note on her performer in London. People need to get a new hobby
@iamRamad0n well I didn't like suus but I couldn't really fault it.
@iamRamad0n like what the hell they saying? I can't wait to hear the Albanian version tomorrow??  :)) #imAlive
@iamRamad0n oh I'm not saying for a minute she was bad at all.... I just hope what she told me she had in London doesn't develop
@iamRamad0n tbh she was really good at both Amsterdam and London.
@iamRamad0n perfection then. She told me she had a cold in London.
@iamRamad0n I hope she gets over her cold/ sore throat ready for Vienna then
#eurovisionVillage stage taking shape inVienna I take it they are using the same stage for life ball then #Eurovision 
@EscCro can mr 80s help?  
@EscCro @issavienojums sad thing is ... My green outfit would be better than my pink one :-//!
@EscCro @issavienojums well I didn't buy it for pollaponk day but it WOULD do for pollaponk haha.
I've been in town way too long and spent way too much .... Take me home. Where it will be back to bed.
@issavienojums @EscCro accidentally bought a green pollaponk outfit for Vienna today #oops
@jkp66fi @issavienojums @EscCro and you say drunk Finns are quiet? Lol
Flashmob with @boggieofficial in London .... Love you #warsForNothing @anotherESCfan @issavienojums 
@jkp66fi @issavienojums hahaha I reckon I'll look like this at the end of day 2 of EFC aswell
#RoyalBaby on its way.
@jkp66fi your acting like its #Eurovision week ;)
#FF to @ElectroVelvet members @BiancaNicholas and @AlexLarke #StillInLoveWithYou the best UK entry for #Eurovision in a very long while
@SchlagerKaty because it wasn't already high enough?
@TimWalksAlong @EurovisionEmily let me know then.
@EscCro delivered by Viking ship
So many past artists for the juries this year .... Cleo from Poland is going to be interesting. #Eurovision
@EscCro 2 weeks but I opted for standard delivery. There is express option ;)
@EscCro ordered mine weeks ago though and only just turned up
@EscCro @OfficialNielsen @kjetilmorland @MinipopIcons I've got @lnrhsynv
@EurovisionEmily okely dokely. I'll watch the semis tonight then
@EurovisionEmily bst?
@EurovisionEmily time?
@EurovisionEmily is there a plan for Malmö this weekend?
My #eurovision top 5 
No doubt I'll make this cold even worse... But actually I feel the meds working already.
Well I kind of elected today as the day I go and buy the last bits for my holiday ... So I better get up and dressed. And wrapped up
@jkp66fi @issavienojums @EscCro more partying :D
@EurovisionEmily @electrowaffle I did wonder where he had disappeared.
@issavienojums @shining_nick well tbh I've been singing "always" for 6 years and I'm not gonna stop that either
@issavienojums I think it's time kata. ...
@issavienojums perhaps we CAN sing this in cities around the world. And do the giannis shuffle
@Johanna7r @issavienojums I just thought the song was terrible and the staging was just like wtf?
@axelbandet well yeah Israel was robbed last year quite how it scored so low....
Oh yeah!! I love this euro mix #onethingishouldhavedone ... The video is too cute. 
@axelbandet not even as a cheesy party tune?
@Johanna7r @issavienojums actually I'll chose Azerbaijan ... I really didn't like them last year. At least hungarys choreography was great.
@issavienojums @Johanna7r blame Portugal .... Suzy does ;)
@Johanna7r @issavienojums probably 2016 haha oh yeah... San Marino for the win
@axelbandet poor Israel :-(
@Johanna7r @issavienojums I love Suzy too but the only thing I would have chose her over was Hungary maybe.
@issavienojums @Johanna7r she will be back one day ....
@issavienojums although giannis has made me like it again. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@issavienojums I heard really bad karaoke versions of it every time I got off the subway thouThere's nothing that could have spoilt it more.
@Johanna7r @issavienojums I was ecstatic #QueenValentina
@axelbandet 39th and 40th?
@issavienojums  blame Copenhagen for making it my last place.
@issavienojums I have no strong feelings for Denmark this year... So he manages about 30 for me. Last year however ....
@issavienojums @Johanna7r <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>One can dream... Tbh if Malta qualify 10th and Israel 11th then I'll be furious
I find it funny that even though my top 40 has dramatically changed over the weeks.... My bottom 2 Netherlands and Malta still remain.
@axelbandet Netherlands?? I didn't forget... She's my bottom 2. Really can't stand the song. #sorrynotsorry
@Johanna7r and Israel is just my guilty pleasure. God I can imagine the fan drama now if he qualified instead of like Slovenia maybe haha
Happy May Day ..... Not that it means jack to me... Roll on Monday May Bank Holiday :)
@axelbandet it's.... Different I guess... Quite looking to seeing it on stage tbh.
@Johanna7r tbh if I don't have Belarus as well...I will be distraught
@axelbandet if you say so... I guess he's cute.
@Johanna7r well to be honest as long as I get rus, bel, Hun in 1 and azer, cyp, israel in 2 I'd be very happy.
@axelbandet tbh I'd just be happy with Russia, Belarus and Hungary ,... Everyone else I, not too bothered about
@Johanna7r I have both of them as qualifiersSemi 1 is much harder because there are more than 10 I like..Semi 2 I chose Iceland as backup
Predictions for semi 2 qualifiers: Lithuania, Montenegro, Norway, Czech Republic, Israel, Azerbaijan, Iceland, Sweden, Cyprus, Slovenia
@axelbandet who are you not happy with?
@Johanna7r aww but it's such a sweet song... She's won me over with this whole flashmob tour...
Predictions for semi 1 qualifiers: Moldova, Macedonia, Estonia, Serbia, Hungary, Belarus, Russia, Albania, Romania, Georgia.
@Johanna7r switch Armenia with Hungary
Praise the Lord!!! My appetite is back finally.... Haven't eaten since Monday so I think it's time to fill up...
At first I thought you were just a pretty face... Now I'm like who are you??
I love @Lenas_view new single Traffic Lights 
It's #Eurovision month!!!!! Eeeekkkk!!!! I shall be on way to Vienna this time next week :))
@Reality_Tim start a fire was terrible. Even I didn't like Azerbaijan that year. This song is in a completely different league
@Reality_Tim @anotherESCfan you live in a crazy world .
@issavienojums @jkp66fi @EscCro will Jari 2004 be there? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@anotherESCfan Iceland beats Azerbaijan? I just can't
@Arianna483 the thing is though ... It doesn't need big staging. The song is pretty spectacular on its own... Or am I on my own here??
@w12plive tbh I think Azerbaijan will play it safe this year and go for simple staging #TeamWolf
@anotherESCfan @w12plive a truly magical song. If Azerbaijan deserved a win ... It's this year. #teamwolf
@w12plive golden boy has to be this years quero ser tua... Great party tune.... But will it qualify??
@AllTimeFiona yeah a totally epic song.
@issavienojums @w12plive this is EPIC
Got to love this song @w12plive oh yes!! A total 100% Eurovision song. Denmark slays!!
In a moment like this?
@anotherESCfan @w12plive against Ukraine ... Boy yes.
@elainovision @w12plive really hope she sings it in Vienna.
I guess I was too late with my request :-( perhaps next week.... @w12plive
@elainovision yey!!! #unstoppables @w12plive sang with such emotion on Sunday,
@KathLockett like who actually reads okio??
@EurovisionEmily great choice #caramia @w12plive
@waynelineker super jealous .... Are you still in Ibiza?
High on penicillin and still shaking what mamma gave me @w12plive
A song I couldn't stand before and during the contest .. Now I've embraced my inner Slavic girl. @w12plive
Jan Johansen was so devilishly good looking in 1995.... <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> I might die when I meet him in Vienna.
15 minutes until @w12plive .... Listening ill in bed so no #w12pselfie today. <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
And another 12 ogae points go to .... Sweden <PENSIVE FACE> #hellobye
Looking back ... Why didn't Estonia qualify? I actually love this routine. #copenhagen2014
@Johanna7r the only bad about France was he stage was way too big for them. Twin twin are such party animals.
@Johanna7r I think probably if they had Molly starting position it would help them. But we're not getting that again.
The awkward moment when the balloons that come down in celebration are Swedish colours <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> possibly the best part of the night #dublin1995
And Norway win ... And I'm unimpressed. Sweden were robbed. #dublin1995
@Johanna7r just don't need it to stick out like France 2014 :-//
Finally Germany has a point haha #dublin1995
@jkp66fi @SpinninAlb @EscCro @issavienojums sing carola ;)
@Johanna7r @ElectroVelvet I think it's definitely one of those songs people are going to remember. Staging is key
@Johanna7r @ElectroVelvet well I loved it on first hearing then went through a dodgy patch, but love it again.
@Johanna7r @ElectroVelvet yeah they really deserve to do so well. Two great sweet artists, bit of fun to cheer up the Warriors.
@Johanna7r @ElectroVelvet well we need more than 1. And I really hope electro velvet do well. Like not win, but I really hope for left side.
Cyprus 12 points to .... Yup #dublin1995 and for god sake Sweden dropped to 3rd
@Johanna7r we need something to dance to in the final. I think it'll bomb in the final though
@Johanna7r Yep ... I still think it'll qualify.
@Johanna7r I love that they gave 7 to Israel :))
The Awkward moment where you think ... What the hell have Sweden done??? #Eurovision #heroes 
And Norway is pulling away :-( #dublin1995
With the televote love city groove would have stormed this.... #dublin1995 the jury's just not ready for rap
Zagreb seems to have a very nice cathedral
Damn... Norway back in the lead. #dublin1995  I don't even like nocturne that much.
I blame Turkey for everything bad in this year #dublin1995 only 1 point for Sweden? Pfft
And then Spain come and mix it back up #dublin1995
Surprise voting from Austria. Sweden still in the lead #dublin1995
Nothing from Germany :/( but At least Sweden 12 :)) #dublin1995
@Eurovisionista I either fell asleep or they really didn't make an impact on me
Irish bastards ... 1 point for love city groove?? #dublin1995
Did I fall asleep during Iceland, Austria, Turkey and Croatia? I do not even remember seeing them #dublin1995
Results time ...  #dublin1995
@Maikeeel considering how much I had to spend on my flights I would have been better getting a train
@Johanna7r they released France ....
12. Sweden
10. Uk
8. Israel 
7. Greece
6. Slovenia
5. France
4. Norway
3. Denmark
2. Belgium 

#dublin1995
So apologises but I can only rank 9 songs for #dublin1995 so here we go ....
@jkp66fi yes Greece was much better. I'll blame Cyprus on Turkey ;)
@jkp66fi no wonders you like it ... Your drunk
First lot of ogae 12 points go to Sweden .....
@Maikeeel I love that she's getting the train though. It's supposed a beautiful route.
Tbh they've saved all the best songs for last ... Slovenia and Israel #dublin1995
@issavienojums @johnniew_88 @kyliewilson well I've got two week of antibiotics so hopefully I'll be all better by time I hit Vienna.
@Maikeeel she should walk .... Walk along walk along baby
@jkp66fi what's with that love for Cyprus? Like I just don't get it.
@issavienojums @johnniew_88 @kyliewilson like I can hardly move. It took me a while to walk to the doctors. Let alone run after jan johansen
@issavienojums @johnniew_88 @kyliewilson hopefully you won't need to. If I'm this ill in Vienna then I'm going to have a terrible time.
@johnniew_88 @kyliewilson @issavienojums at this rate Vienna will be the first time I eat... I can't keep anything down :-(
@johnniew_88 @issavienojums @ShadyEuroFreak I'll give the studio version a go... I really didn't like it
@issavienojums @ShadyEuroFreak at least my favourite is se pa mej ;)
Jan Johansen was so devilishly good looking in 1995.... <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> I might die when I meet him in Vienna.
@issavienojums @ShadyEuroFreak quite possibly the worst song ever ... Truly terrible.
Not bad from Denmark tbh #dublin1995
@ShadyEuroFreak tbh 1995 is a dreadful year. Only saved by Sweden and UK if you ask me.
@ShadyEuroFreak I know.... I might die <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> if only he still looked like this though. But the song is just perfection. How did this not win!?
Oh and Sweden saves the day!!!!! Jan johansen :D <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> #dublin1995 Sweden for the win
Cyprus trying to be 10 songs at once and failing in all of them #dublin1995
And it's back to the full songs ... #dublin1995
@issavienojums @Johanna7r I don't think singing one thing I should have done in every city we go to has the same appeal though.
What I love about love city groove is that it really represents British pop music around that time. #dublin1995
Oh yeah!! I really forgot how great love city groove actually is #dublin1995 #sluthiphoppop
#dublin1995 probably love city groove is going to be my favourite.
Back onto #dublin1995 Belgium was okay ... But it's all so meh
@issavienojums @kyliewilson well no fish either :-//
I must remember to go to terminal 3 next week and not my usual terminal 5 ... Might get lost.
@issavienojums @kyliewilson oh and hopefully it's not red meat either ;)
@issavienojums @kyliewilson then curry us up
@issavienojums @kyliewilson I'm fine with curry ... As long as it doesn't burn my mouth off :))
@kyliewilson @issavienojums well I don't mind making a big lasagne and leaving it in the fridge and just warming it up whenever someone want
@kyliewilson @issavienojums actually I make the best lasagne but depends on what people want to make considering we will be out a lot.
@issavienojums and to think I was gonna do a pascal and go without my hoody ... Jesus <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
If we go to Stockholm in 2016 ... I really hope we get either Carola or Alcazar for home turf....
@issavienojums @kyliewilson I'll trade crepes for scrambled eggs on a different day. Pretty much all I can make
Queen Carola #makeachange 
@Johanna7r @issavienojums I do that if I can't find songs on UK itunes. Sometimes it's extremely hard to find Swedish acts on there
@kyliewilson by the way my phone has a real problem with your name kylie.... Always changes it to Julie ;)
@issavienojums yeah it was last time in London. Although I still blame this on Amsterdam just has never really gone.
@kyliewilson @issavienojums wonder if we can persuade mamma kata to make crepes ;))
@kyliewilson @issavienojums bring Nutella to Vienna kylie .... We're going to live on the stuff.
@Johanna7r @issavienojums I did download quite a few this year .... Vaidas... Boggie .... Ann Sophie
@issavienojums I know right .... Twin twin covered in Nutella. Which reminds me I'm saving my Nutella to bring to Vienna. :))
@issavienojums this is the worst I've been ill in a long time. After spending two hours throwing up in the toilet this morning.
@issavienojums saw this and thought of you .... 
@issavienojums @Johanna7r I haven't listened to it since we went to Paris actually ..: this needs to change
@Johanna7r @issavienojums and twin twin
The joys of penicillin.... I've got a respiratory infection. On the meds for 2 weeks 
@Kevinsherwin I had to stop it ... I was losing the will I live .... I will watch the rest though later haha
@hanaleakey oh boy cheeky boy oh girl cheeky girl
@kyliewilson you gotta get buying!!! Like just head to primark. Nice and cheerful.
I'm still unsure on all that. You might have to do with power rangers party ;)  
@EscCro are we having late birthday celebrations in #Vienna ?
@EscCro oh okay ;)
@EscCro how many 30ths are you having?
@jkp66fi @EscCro @SchlagerKaty @issavienojums @kyliewilson starting euroboat very early.
@jkp66fi @EscCro @SchlagerKaty @issavienojums @kyliewilson bolli darling. A man after my own heart. Yes sweety darling #abfab
I suppose I better get out of bed.... The doctor won't be pleased to see me in my dressing gown
@EscCro @SchlagerKaty @issavienojums @jkp66fi @kyliewilson perhaps next year for #stockholm2016 ?
@kyliewilson "Oh god I sent a message I might severely regret sending" 

First time I've seen Boggie's performance at ADal 2015 ... Sad to not to see her promotional guitarist play ... But he sings too <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
<SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> 
@seanbookless that also wouldn't help you in court ;)
@seanbookless there is no denying he's hot. But I feel like an old perv saying it
@seanbookless not sure I still agree with flirting with a 17year old.
@issavienojums Dana international would be very ..... Interesting
Hallelujah!!! First song I liked over an hour into the show #France #dublin1995
@seanbookless be careful where your sticking things when you meet nadav ;)
@seanbookless Latvia and Belgium no.... Slovenia and France okay
@seanbookless well tbh I love Israel ... But 12 points? Dude
@issavienojums hot eyes then ..... And.......... Dana international haha
@issavienojums Merci Merci Merci ... And if not I will join. And hope they have someone decent like Suzy and Ryan again.
@issavienojums can you contact them for me asking if ogae UK member would able to #joinus please? I don't want2have to join just for party
@seanbookless why are your votes upside down??
@issavienojums any info yet about ogae Denmark party?
Okay so I'm an hour into #dublin1995 and I've yet to hear a song I actually like
@issavienojums @Eurovisionista tbh im surprised Moldova is still up there
@issavienojums going purely for hot eyes tbh
@issavienojums on myyyyyy owwwwwwn again
@Eurovisionista 1. Azerbaijan 2. Belarus 3. Russia 4. Italy 5. UK
@issavienojums I'm your drama queeeeeeeen
@issavienojums kind of want to go to Berlin now hahha 
Ireland's pretty boring they really didn't want to host a 4th time in a row #dublin1995
Poland first ... Oh god <HEAR-NO-EVIL MONKEY> #dublin1995
Seeing as I'm ill in bed thought I would watch #dublin1995
@jkp66fi @issavienojums @GjersvikOdd @EscCro @raquelita411 I was the silent drunk one
@issavienojums @jkp66fi @GjersvikOdd @EscCro @raquelita411 I met a Finn on the bus to friends arena... He wouldn't shut up.
Aww pains me when I see this semi final performance from Romania...loved it so much. But ruined by dodgy ear pieces 
@Johanna7r @TimWalksAlong yes playing with fire was just perfection.  The staging for miracle was just so static. Playing with fire was fun.
@TimWalksAlong @Johanna7r the fact that he played it like a lunatic .... That was my problem... At least play it convincingly
@blanketperson there's videos of you on the Internet <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@Johanna7r @TimWalksAlong like Romania was my number one .... Until I saw that round piano.... Kind of just ruined it all for me.
@Johanna7r @TimWalksAlong oh the song I actually liked pre contest... Then I saw it on stage and just ..no. Tbh it was the same with Romania
@TimWalksAlong @Johanna7r I don't remember ireland now let alone in 30 years
@blanketperson I want to see you in tin foil... 
@Johanna7r @TimWalksAlong what's with the love for Ireland? To me it was such a car crash on stage.
“@TimWalksAlong: @Refshaleoen @Johanna7r I was hoping for Ireland :'D” Jesus <WEARY FACE>
@blanketperson you didn't stick around to show me
@issavienojums plllllllease it's got to at least qualify.
@TimWalksAlong @Johanna7r no but for fan wanks it does
@Johanna7r @TimWalksAlong yeah... Super tense..... And random my arse. I thought the whole place was gonna explode.
@blanketperson *tsk* anyone can dance to golden boy.
@cin_esc @Johanna7r @TimWalksAlong I want someone to win by 1 point.... I can Imagine having no hair left at the end of the voting
@Johanna7r @TimWalksAlong Thursday night in the arena when she qualified .... That was the craziest feeling ever.
@blanketperson "don't deny" you can't dance to this.
@Johanna7r @TimWalksAlong well at least conchita wasn't going to win until Thursday.... Before that it was wide open.
Tbh I want Israel to win just for the lols
@Johanna7r @TimWalksAlong tbh I don't care who wins as long as it's not a runaway... That I would really hate
@jkp66fi shame on you!!! Minsk forever!
@Johanna7r @TimWalksAlong I've just been listening to Italy and the San redo performance though ... I cried lol... In my defence I'm ill lol
@Johanna7r @TimWalksAlong I really hope not...I don't really even like the song that much. Although it would be interesting to see who hosts
@Johanna7r @TimWalksAlong if they stage it like melodi Grand Prix it's going to be Immense
@Johanna7r @TimWalksAlong the pre party promotion has really blown it wide open for me...
@Johanna7r @TimWalksAlong I think tbh Norway could be on for a win here.
@TimWalksAlong @Johanna7r Estonia shot themselves in the foot by doing none of the pre party promotion.
@mh1986esc vaclav blew me away with Roxanne
@mh1986esc they really pulled it out the bag on Sunday ... What voices!! Never rated them before, but now they are in my top 10
@issavienojums well it fits in with something random winning :-) plus I do love it
Am I the only one that can see @UzariAndMaimuna actually winning this? #minsk2016
Well this morning I threw up twice .... And actually I'm starting to feel somewhat normal again.
@issavienojums I'm a very hard patient ;)
@issavienojums soup and honey? Boy you trying to make me barf? I'm just taking my night nurse and vitamin c
@EurovisionEmily well the EBU kind of made a point of not backing down to their demands.  Jon ola is adamant that there will always be big 5
@issavienojums I have none of these of course.
“@BiancaNicholas: @Robinwindsor come <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<WHITE SMILING FACE>️” you gotta come big guy. You wouldn't regret it.
@EurovisionEmily Turkey themselves think they are a powerhouse
Four hour afternoon nap.... You can tell I'm ill for sure.... I would have thought it would have made me feel better... Nope, I feel worse.
@eurovicious @raquelita411 ... not really what I'm looking for though.... Now if any fit fan boys want to chase me. I'm all ready <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@eurovicious @raquelita411 hahaha your not the first one to say so...l I wonder if I will get a bunch of fan girls chasing me in Vienna?
@eurovicious evidently not though.
@eurovicious @raquelita411 that is so cute. Thanks for sharing... Perhaps he deserves to return to my top 10 after all.
@issavienojums consider yourself lucky that you don't have this cold or mine which has come back with vengeance
@elainovision @NinniLumi that would be a great choice
@elainovision @NinniLumi his second song at LEP was great. I should look that one up.
@elainovision but still ... Two different queues .... And the floor is separated into two because of the bridge to the green room
@NinniLumi he seems really able to get the crowd going when the tempo and beat increases .. Just hope he can do that on the bigger stage too
@NinniLumi yeah EIC and LEP he really got me loving his song. Not as good as Sergei but it's a good follow up.
@NinniLumi adio is such a surprise for me
@elainovision I'm not sure if I'm north or South .... Picking mine up in Vienna on the 9th
This cold/flu just will not quit. Thankfully my meeting is over and now I'm off to the doctors... Gonna need some penicillin I think.
Quite why @Eurovision give people press accreditation when they aren't even going for two weeks is beyond me. Yet they reject people who are
Well the ogae polls are out on Friday. Shame though because my top 10 has massively changed since I submitted my votes.
Sadly I have to get up as I need to be somewhere at 1130. Oh the joys
The cold has taken hold again .... I can hardly move, and my throat feels like it's being ripped out.
@anotherESCfan I have matching chinos .... In teal so I'm the full Azerbaijan colours.
Quite obviously I was blinded by the hotness of David Boreanaz
In bed watching Valentine ... I've only seen this one before ... But I didn't remember it being so bad
The makemakes actually look great on TV though Sadly in real life they have very little charisma #WSFO I hope they prove me wrong in Vienna
Johann Sebastian bass are doing a total rip off of daft punk ... Tbh I hate acts like this but this would have been amazing #WSFO
@EurovisionEmily @anotherESCfan it's a performance I am really longing to see
Celine Ann just really wasn't anything special #WSFO
@EurovisionEmily @anotherESCfan I think POLINA is going to blow me away....
@EurovisionEmily @anotherESCfan they are my joint favourites and I am Probably going to have a third joint favourite by the end of semi 1 ;)
Great watching this video after having danced my socks off in the venue this Sunday. 
Aww I love dawa - feel alive #WSFO Austria should have sent this song.
Quite why Austria would want to send a French song to #eurovision would be beyond me #WSFO
Folkshilfe were nice enough .... No winner though #WSFO
Sat down to watch Austria's national final. First up .... Folkshilfe
Ahh they updated the website and app... And I've only just noticed #Eurovision
@anotherESCfan azeebaijan/Belarus shoes are ready :)) #eurovision 
@anotherESCfan I saw one of them yeah lol so cute
@anotherESCfan makes having to wait for it even more exciting :)
I am in love with David boreanaz all over again 
There's nothing funny about the ham game.... I beg to differ.
If you hang around garbage long enough, you're gonna stink. #realhousewives
@Neilis2cool yeah I'm flying on the 8th. Got some travel to do before I settle in Vienna for #eurovisjon
Finally got confirmation of my business meeting tomorrow. New venture is looking very positive.
So I shall be going to Vienna in 10 days .... Is it too early to start packing?
@jkp66fi the song was terrible
In the shop today I'm playing #melfest2007 .... Why the hell did they choose the ark??
@shining_nick which year are you watching?
@shining_nick that was soft teenage rock though... Not really the same.
@shining_nick Finland .... They do rock really well
@shining_nick it's probably one of their better songs.
I think Boggie is right ... Everything seems so superficial.
Sad news about Keith Harris ... Rip Keith Harris .... And Orville too
@Johanna7r @issavienojums is rather San Marino qualify over this
@issavienojums @elainovision @NinniLumi that's exactly the way to be at places like this. Miss Moldova shouldn't be silenced.
LabourParty propaganda comes through the door and I immediately Rip it up and put it in the bin. I don't have time for such tripe. #vote2015
@issavienojums @elainovision @NinniLumi that was like a collective douchebag moment. But at the lives, no amount of boos is going to stop me
@issavienojums @elainovision @NinniLumi I would never let anyone spoil the time I was having. I mean the Russian boos were different.
@issavienojums luckily they don't really have my attention. Just some info I've stumbled across. Ah well
@issavienojums @elainovision @NinniLumi but to be honest we shouldn't let these "non fans" spoil what we love.
@issavienojums guy trouble I guess. The hypocrisy of some people is just .... I can't.
Some people are just so full of shit it's unreal. Can't believe what I've just found out.
@issavienojums haha so true. Like what the hell?? That's two songs ruined by different versions
@anotherESCfan well I didn't find her performance from Moscow yet .... Think I'm going to wait for the semi.
I find it highly disrespectful that they didn't play a single Azerbaijani upbeat song last night yet they played all the terrible euro mixes
@Yngve_esc I hope you get to see them. And I hope they do mini concert in vienna
@Yngve_esc well I'll be going to Vienna after of course
@Yngve_esc ask vaclav to sing some Roxane for you ;)
@Yngve_esc ah lovely. Ill be in Prague in 2 weeks but sadly they'll be in Vienna. :-(
@Yngve_esc they are both great. Amazing last night. Was you there in London?
Romania and Estonia most probably lost out because of the lack of promotion. And Moldova was only ever a bit of fun
I feel sad that Macedonia has no longer made my top 10 :-( .... Other former top 10 songs include, Romania, Moldova, Estonia and Slovenia
@Refshaleoen: My new top 10 
1= Azerbaijan
1= Belarus
3. Russia
4. Italy
5. Hungary
6. Norway
7. UK 
8. Cyprus
9. Israel
10. Czech Republic
I realised I made a mistake with my top 10 earlier so are we go again ....
@Yngve_esc great to see someone else with the Czech Republic in their top 10
@MoonieCFC @PatrickTTGBArmy whoop thanks so much. Bring on Vienna!
@PatrickTTGBArmy @MoonieCFC is that really the set list?
I think I just worked something out ... And if I'm right then ... Wow. At the minute I remain very suspicious <EYES>
@cin_esc well the only thing is guys was an acoustic slow number and ones was an upbeat song. So of course people moved more for knez
Pizza in the oven .... Fresh bedding on bed .... Let's do this.
My @MinipopIcons t shirt is here courtesy of @redbubble and its sooo cute 
On my final leg .... One hour on the bus then I'm home. All I want to do now is sleep until Vienna.
@issavienojums I need to sleep first
@issavienojums but to be honest I need to work hard this two weeks. And the break from ESC will be good
@issavienojums I literally think we should. Or at least go to pairs and Rome with Boggie. Then onto Vienna
Eye spy with my little eye - the river Humber. - nearly home
Hahaha yes @BelChi90 should have been ther <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> think he might have joined in?  
So proud of @boggieofficial everyone in London today loved it. What a great crowd. Best so far. Bring on Vienna.
Next stop Vienna! Eeeeeeekkkkk  
I will forever have "ha your weaves on the floor bitch" in my head .... #previoustweet
Of course Boggie was the highlight of the day but the two girls having a cat fight on the floor outside the tubestation just took T.biscuit
@issavienojums woop! Have a safe flight
Wow looking at the running order for semi 1 again, I have Hungary Belarus and Russia all back to back.That is going to be an awesome 10 mins
@elainovision I'll share some later. I got some pretty spectacular ones.
Jesus I just got on possibly the oldest train ever Surprised it isn't run by coal. Why do @northernrailorg still have trains like this!?
@elainovision just two from Norway
@elainovision just for my own collection really .... I won't use them for anything
I'm kind of just in love with the euro mix of Cyprus though because the video is just too cute
I really can't deal with the amount of club mixes this year. Cyprus is the only one I can stand. Its pretty spectacular
@issavienojums did you make it to the airport okay?
Already waiting for second train ... This is like the easiest journey home ever.
@elainovision @megan_dave hey I was second row and tall ... I danced ;)
@elainovision hope you don't mind. I've stolen some of your photos as my phone ran out of battery after UK ;)
@gutterslush wear a tight Tshirt and give me a promo cd and you have my vote <GRIMACING FACE>
@rowansingh @British_Airways that's certainly one BIG Dreamliner
All I guy has to do to me is have a cute cheeky smile and I go weak at the knees. I want to move to Hungary, like for real.
@gutterslush I wish It would go on forever. Really hope the qualify. Plus I got promo stuff from them <GRIMACING FACE>
@gutterslush plus they can both sing. They were both so good. Had the audience in the palms of their hands
@gutterslush the Czech Republic absolutely slayed us all though. Boy they were on fire. I mean look at it 
@gutterslush extremely .... Mørland is so dreamy and Debrah just a doll. They had us all on side.
@Ginger_Canary it was autocorrected from awks #epicfail
@gutterslush just so you know ..... Norway slayed last night. Think they might actually give måns a fight for the title
@Ginger_Canary asks
@AnnSophie nice to see you in London. And see you for the big one in Vienna x
so proud of @ElectroVelvet @BiancaNicholas @AlexLarke on their number one single. Can't wait to see it on stage in Vienna. #BringItOn
Really looking forward to seeing the set list for @takethat later... First night on tour. Good luck boys, see you in Vienna.
I am in love with a Hungarian man <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
On the way home after an amazing weekend in London: I guess I need to rest before #vienna2015
@scott_mills and @MelGiedroyc_ for @bbceurovision this is going to be hilariously great. See you guys in #vienna #eurovision #Vienna2015
Hungarian men <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
@KurtCalleja @LDNEurovision we Eurovision fans never lie to our crush
@Johanna7r @elainovision @issavienojums I liked it back in Mesc ... But since the re vamp they absolutely killed it for me
@Johanna7r @elainovision @issavienojums tbh I don't need to dance to Cyprus .... I just stand in awe at his talent
@elainovision well then we can be front row and finally meet properly. :D hopefully I get my top 10 at least in the final.
@elainovision well I'm going to jury final too.... You standing?
@elainovision @issavienojums @NinniLumi I loved the knez selfie ..... He's such a cool guy.
@Johanna7r @elainovision @issavienojums maltas medley was great ... But as for warrior, I don't think I'll ever get back to liking it
@elainovision what's the next event you'll be at? Vienna?
@elainovision @Johanna7r @issavienojums they need to listen to the euro mix then.... Then you can dance. 
@elainovision we were. You were with Martin right?
How fantastic was @KurtCalleja last night at @LDNEurovision ? And got to say.... Boy he's nice <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@Johanna7r @issavienojums the boy can sing #Cyprus
@Johanna7r @issavienojums he is so cute and his other songs were great.
@elainovision I was at least singing ;)
@elainovision @issavienojums @NinniLumi apologises .... I was the point pointing at kata when paddy asked that question. <SMIRKING FACE>
@elainovision I hope they do something at Euro fan cafe. I really need to meet these again. She seemed so happy I was singing along
I am seriously going to have to get my new ranking sorted out..... I feel that Czech Republic have climbed. They were absolutely brilliant
@issavienojums @NinniLumi paddy o Connell is a legend. Paddy wants our love
@issavienojums Czech Republic <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@elainovision haha yeah kata just told me. I feel bad. But nice to kinda see you haha
@SARBELAKOS amazing performance tonight... Looking good ;)
Come and find me in 9 hours. I shall be singing wars for nothing at St. Paul's cathedral with @boggieofficial #12pm
Great night at @LDNEurovision with @issavienojums and @anotherESCfan .... Feet are bloody killing me but totally worth it. #deadTomorrow
@blanketperson I saw Spider-Man... It was my highlight of the marathon tbqh
@blanketperson *waves back* I never saw you :-(
@AllTimeFiona Azerbaijan always be with me
@AllTimeFiona I still have my Azerbaijan flag ... But sophisticatedly turned into a pocket hanky for my blazer <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E> well we are in London ;)

Queen conchita #lep #eurovision #london 
@LDNEurovision in #London with the potential winner of #Eurovision 
@LDNEurovision #greece #london #eurovision 
Braving the illness but on the way into #london for @LDNEurovision .... Hopefully alcohol will cure me 
Eduard romanyutu for Euro Fan Cafe ..... This is great news.
@EurovisionEmily so at least I have a country from both semis now.
@EurovisionEmily it's now my joint favourite ...!its always been in my top 10 but after Amsterdam I couldn't not love this.
@EurovisionEmily I'm getting obsessed with time now :))
Tell me where I belong I've been trying for so long.
@EurovisionEmily it's terrible
@UzariAndMaimuna @LDNEurovision сумую па табе
@rnc1966 boo hiss boo. Hopefully you get to see some of the stream then. I'll wave for you
@EurovisionEmily I would no longer be a fan of Eurovision
@rnc1966 will you also in attendance?
@shining_nick I know tell me about it.
Looking forward2 @LDNEurovision with my groupies. This is my first stop before Vienna. We're nearly at the final stretch people #Eurovision
: Flying the Belarus flag for @UzariAndMaimuna at @LDNEurovision today. There for you In spirit
@shining_nick @issavienojums you haven't met her.. You need to meet her then you will realise she deserves all our attention.
@shining_nick @issavienojums Boggie is life
@shining_nick @issavienojums at least we have Boggie
@mh1986esc where are you heading to watch the runners? We might go and watch a bit before we head to Leicester Square
@AskLloydsBank yes finally but I've had nothing but troubles with my card lately ..: either declined because of security or checked slow
@jkp66fi donor kebab then sick ... Yup that's British pub crawl
Ordering a pizza to the hotel room .... @issavienojums thinks it's so bad 80s movie of me.
@jkp66fi cool pub crawl ;) very British
@jkp66fi Brit beer? Like ale?? I only drink the imported stuff lol
@jkp66fi why is that?
@jkp66fi haha well perhaps they need to revisit their pricing
I effing LOVE Belarus 
@jkp66fi things will be closed beginning of September??
This spoke to me like you don't believe "I travel in my imagination, or should it be I 'live' in my imagination. 
@EurovisionDude well my schooling paid off then. I was trained as a journalist at uni
Some random protest about black slavery in America down Oxford street.... Did they not know slavery is over?
#Dumas at @Tate was absolutely amazing. So dark so much depth seriously messed .... Spoke to me like I was the artist myself
Beyond the fear .... Let's builllllld the bridge. I think there should always be a song about #BuildingBridges #InTheNameOfLove
@British_Airways if I book flights now but take flight after the avois changes I still get the old points rather than the new system?
@littleboots @British_Airways yup getting booking your flights before Monday .... I#
@jkp66fi no room for food .... Full of beer
@jkp66fi yeah I'll try later with iPad .... Or wait until Monday for laptop. What about tickets for pre party? On door or before?
@jkp66fi yeah you see im doing it on mobile so screens are totally different.
@jkp66fi no not yet .... Need to try again later I'll see if I can put in promo code
@jkp66fi yeah exactly ... Hence why I need to find out how .
@jkp66fi I didn't see promo bit though went straight to payment
@jkp66fi yeah like meal for 64euros??? Like dafuq??
@jkp66fi oh I'll do it later when I'm not on my phone
@jkp66fi oh ... It hasn't come with promo code option though
@jkp66fi this is the right one yes? 
@jkp66fi yup ... Arriving Friday leaving Monday
@jkp66fi going to book them later yes
@LoreenatorDK in supporting both. Luckily different semis
@LoreenatorDK amazing ... I think they might actually be my joint favourites now. With Azerbaijan of course ;)
@LoreenatorDK how was uzari and maimuna last night? As good as Amsterdam?
God bless avois though. £75 off my flights. Return flight to Helsinki for £50 don't mind if I do
@LoreenatorDK tbh I want to be in quite a few ... Azerbaijan, Belarus and now San Marino ;)
And 30 minutes later FINALLY I have flights to Helsinki. I'm not even going to attempt Sofia right now. I don't have the patience today
@LoreenatorDK perhaps I need to head up this San Marino delegation.
@LoreenatorDK michele feat Valentina "we are the world"
@LoreenatorDK if he came back with a good song ... Then maybe ;)
@LoreenatorDK no
@NichoolasGibb I've probably ranked it too high but it gets me moving at least
@NichoolasGibb still, I enjoyed the performance
Trying to book flights to Helsinki .... Lloyds Bank is doing my head
@squawkbox Jessica was robbed.
Have I died? I'm sat listening to Diwanit Bugale ... Scotland's first ever entry for #Eurovision.. Who thought bagpipes were a good idea?
@HyattCoolum yes of course they should be anti the laws and such ... But I just think they should have shown the other side of Russians
@HyattCoolum was about immigrants and such. The bbc have a obligation to not be biased and the shows are very anti Russia.
@HyattCoolum my point though is the bbc never showed the OTHER side of the story .... And not about the gay side of the show. The first show
@LDNEurovision need to find myself a big umbrella.
@Johanna7r god what absolutely craptacular video.
@Johanna7r @shining_nick tbh I don't think I saw the video though... I might have to watch it
@shining_nick @Johanna7r .... For a few seconds. It's not as if we start voting for song titles or even artists
@shining_nick @Johanna7r but on the stage the lyrics are going to mean more When does the title ever get mentioned? Other than on screen ...
@Johanna7r @shining_nick Georgia 2009 was my favourite of that year to be honest.
@shining_nick @Johanna7r then who cares about the title...? They still sing don't deny in it
@shining_nick @Johanna7r but come on ... Wars for nothing is basically a song about Russia and Ukraine ... Or Israel and Palestine.
@shining_nick @Johanna7r it doesn't change anything.... It's still the same song.
@shining_nick @Johanna7r like how does the title change, change the politics of the song?
@shining_nick @Johanna7r if anything Armenia should have been told to change their song not just the title
@shining_nick @Johanna7r but general themes are still political. Why does it just ban specifics?
@Johanna7r if say like sanna Nielsen has sung Phoenix ... No way would it have won
@Johanna7r 100% won because of conchita. I mean she did have a good song ... But paired with her gave her the win.
@Johanna7r funniest thing was when Fraser said it won for the song ... It was amazing. No wayyyyy would Phoenix had won without conchita.
@Johanna7r I think it was Karen who said that sending political messages seems to be "okay" when it fits with what the majority of us think
@LDNEurovision I take it no more surprises? This is final line up?
@Johanna7r is just as political as we don't want to put in.
@Johanna7r it's what got mentioned in the conference yesterday .... There no politics allowed in Eurovision but sending a bearded lady ...
Look how cuttttte @issavienojums how can you not like them? 
@Johanna7r it's a simple song but it's done very effectively. I love how the EBU allow a song like this despite saying no politics though
@Johanna7r aww but if you met her, and hear her story... You can really feel the emotion. The lyrics are beautiful too.
Just shows we ourselves are not tolerant #extremeRussia
And sadly this kind of media coverage does nothing but tear down any bridges for the future, and Incites hatred against the whole of Russia
They say Putin has a approval of 90% ... Again I don't believe it. If he's corrupt why do we believe this figure? Load of BS #extremeRussia
I've got one really big problem with #extremeRussia like they portray this as universal across Russia. And I just don't believe it.
@Johanna7r Italy and Hungary now round off my top 5
@EscCro @issavienojums @OgaeSerbia on the way to Vienna ;)
@KarenFricker2 @BBC and yet we are all crying out for a return to NF? Im fine with the current selection, milky and EV are actually good.
@KarenFricker2 @BBC to be honest I wouldn't trust a NF again What was the last few songs we sent via NF? Scooch?? Andy Abraham??
@Johanna7r yes they are all very good but just feels weird that I'm like supporting the former soviets
@shining_nick I know right? That's exactly what I'm thinking
@EurovisionDude haha your th second person to send me that ... God I look pretty serious
@EscCro @issavienojums @OgaeSerbia when? 7th may?
@SchlagerKaty @The90sLife ahhhh the good old times
I really want to see @Teo_Esc reading out the votes from Belarus this year. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@The90sLife @SchlagerKaty ain't nobody got time for that
Is it odd that my top 3 are Belarus, Azerbaijan and Russia? #Eurovision
@LoreenatorDK wow!!! Guys in suits <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> god damn why didn't he wear this to Amsterdam. I would have been In love.
@lamarymonry dodgy
@EnriqueBlancoC very nice ;) beats the smog of London
@lamarymonry I actually don't have a Spanish flag. But she's not done much to impress me. I like the song though.
Such a cute couple ;) *group hugs*  
I might actually get the old violin out again.... I guess it's like riding a bike??
@UzariAndMaimuna @lnrhsynv @PolinaGagharina yes please do!!! Can't wait to meet you guys. I sooo wish I could play violin lik maimuna
Okay so I've decided.... Flags for Vienna Azerbaijan @lnrhsynv Belarus @UzariAndMaimuna and Russia @PolinaGagharina
@EurovisionEmily I think it'll be uploaded to .tv later
@LoreenatorDK @UzariAndMaimuna I bet they slayed. God I need them in London on Sunday <CONFUSED FACE>
@EurovisionEmily I love this kind of stuff. So glad I went
@EurovisionEmily I know ... Tell me about it. But it's well worth the watch
@EurovisionEmily 10-5 with an hour break ;)
My favourite fact of the day  
@EurovisionEmily oh I've just Seen it. Looks great
@EurovisionEmily you sharing? <EYES>
Top Gear is basically dead seeing as everyone is quitting it.
@ConchitaWurst thank you for your support for Russian artists at ESC ... Join me in cheering so loud for polina in Vienna?
Jesus, risky in Russia but I love it. Douze points  
@NikolausRLD I thought @KarenFricker2 was brilliant .... I need to meet her again. So many questions, sadly I couldn't stick around
@ConchitaWurst what a darling today at @EBU_HQ . Can't wait to see you perform at @LDNEurovision on Sunday and then it's off to Vienna.
So for those who watched #eurovision60 on 
Amazing day with @EBU_HQ at BAFTA
@goaround99 would love to know where they've spent the money
Andi Knoll confirms that #vienna2015 is already over budget #eurovision60
#eurovision60 
@KarenFricker2 amazing keynote at #eurovision60 today. #joinus at 
Lunch time .... This conference is extremely in depth #eurovision60
@EBU_HQ #eurovision60
@mh1986esc @issavienojums @w12plive sorry I just can't stand it...I used to like it before the revamp then I was like why would you do that?
@mh1986esc @issavienojums @w12plive I agree ... Malta 0 from me for sureee
@KathLockett I love you for supporting @UzariAndMaimuna :)) #ILoveBelarus I'm so up for Minsk if not Baku for 2016
@w12plive I actually really do hope the Czech Republic get through to the final. It's a solid enough song.
I've lost faith in this panel. #helloBye
@w12plive Malta made an impact .... Yup a deep impact into the ground
@w12plive they liked Malta? Are you deaf???
@issavienojums kæmpe involved with Montenegro too? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@w12plive never really thought much about this song until Amsterdam tbh. He really got the crowd going.
@EurovisionEmily @w12plive it's just set itself for a fail as soon as he said no
@KathLockett another minute of chain of lights? Jesus. @w12plive shame because I loved both their JESC songs
@LDNEurovision @boggieofficial @elhaidadani93 and what can we expect tomorrow? <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
The last minute is he but I like ooh light a candle lets illuminate the night yes we should #no
@EurovisionEmily @w12plive San Marino tries way too hard .... And fails in every way. All Valentina's hard work is been undone. #no
@Johanna7r @EscCro @issavienojums @elainovision @NinniLumi I'm all for groupies
@issavienojums @EscCro @Johanna7r @elainovision @NinniLumi so funny if the same tourists see us in London hahaha
Time for the juniors ..... #no @w12plive #ChainOfFarts
@EscCro @issavienojums @Johanna7r @elainovision @NinniLumi I sang war for nothing in Amsterdam and tourists wanted photos ;)
@KathLockett being harsh but sooooo true tonight.
@LoreenatorDK literally the cutest photo ever
@w12plive I agree. Great voice but it just doesn't do anything .... And let's face it they're not going to do much staging
God I hate getting he last train to London .... I'm absolutely knackered already and I've still got another hour to go until hotel
@w12plive This is going to make Lithuania stick out even more. Ireland won't qualify again for a second year in a row
@issavienojums well I only need Belarus or Azerbaijan. Then today will be saved from hell
@issavienojums lol we have hope for final minute artists
Do it!!! We need some ra-papa's  
@issavienojums Albania joins @LDNEurovision
@w12plive who wouldn't like a kiss from vaidas?
@w12plive they pretty much smashed it at Amsterdam and now I love this song. Vaidas is such a kook.
@w12plive do I really have to listen through 3 more minutes of Malta?
@EurovisionEmily @mh1986esc @KathLockett @UzariAndMaimuna @w12plive Minsk would be amazing
@joanaplucas maybe they have a lot of anniversary stuff to fit in?
@EurovisionEmily @mh1986esc @w12plive @TaraWillsMusic I actually love Stefan raab but that song just no
@L0oiic your in London ? Are you playing at @LDNEurovision on Sunday?
@EurovisionEmily @w12plive well they have to have a good song to win so maybe this is their year?
@EurovisionEmily @w12plive they always are underrated ... I just hope this year they get what they deserve
@w12plive one of my favourites ... Two great back to back entries for Slovenia with Here for you too , time for a Slovenian win
I bloody love how dramatic ll volo is ....
@joanaplucas no john?? No nadav??
@issavienojums @w12plive embrace it.
@w12plive Now here we are!!!! A bit of power ballad to cheer me up. Go Italy!! Douze douze douze douze
Now THAT would amazing  
@elainovision @w12plive too chirpy ... I need some dark and moody
@Johanna7r @NinniLumi plus it's going to be interesting who gets to host and tbh 2016 with two broadcasters is going to be amazing
@Johanna7r @NinniLumi but at least we don't have to go all the way to Australia ... Isn't that a plus?
@w12plive In my defence I'm just not in a camp happy mood. Like play hard rock hallelujah and it's a total yes
@ShadyEuroFreak lets get happy?? Really?? <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@issavienojums oops I missed that .... A week is like a year in Eurovision
@w12plive ..... Let's get happy .... No, just no.
@issavienojums did you request eduard this year?
@kokofrias144 lovely hair
@NinniLumi but my point is there is a lot of love out there which is probably going to translate across the board
Oh I'm totally moving to Skåne if they do  
@NinniLumi I would probably go on a limb and say that 99% of euro fans have it in their top 15/20 so I think it'll be fine
@NinniLumi I don't think they have to rely on neighbour votes at all. Think it's just one of those hip songs people will love.
@w12plive such a party tune!!!! One of the highlights of #melfest this year. #DontStop love how its soooo Taylor Swift
@NinniLumi I hope so. Would love a country like this to win. Especially when they finally have a winner worthy song
Yom Huledet @issavienojums drinks on Saturday ;)
@EurovisionEmily @w12plive it's pretty spectacular ... The kind of song you actually want on your birthday.
@w12plive second semi final is my favourite tbh.
@issavienojums @NinniLumi @EscEire that Finnish warrior would have slayyyyyed
@issavienojums @mh1986esc Hungarian all the way
@w12plive #w12pselfie still on train <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> 
@w12plive make me happy tonight please such a bad day where I actually got on the wrong train ... No electro velvet puns needed
Who's tuning in for @w12plive tonight then?
These toffs need to shut the fuck up or at least start singing cake to bake.
@Johanna7r @NinniLumi Lithuania were fantastic in Amsterdam. Big surprise. Always liked it but they were brilliant. And vaidas <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Beautiful sunset tonight ... 
@NinniLumi I know I love him now ... Looking forward to more Cypriot magic on Sunday
@Johanna7r @NinniLumi it's probably my biggest mover since Amsterdam ... Along with Boggie
@NinniLumi how could I not??? He's my home boy ... On the way to London with my Cypriot flag for him <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
@NinniLumi 5/10 out your top 10 ita, aze, bel, slo, cyp
Actually so excited to see @kittybrucknell on Sunday night @LDNEurovision
@NinniLumi Boggie???? <WEARY FACE><FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
@herabjorkmusic it's Truly spectacular .... But prayer for those in Chile right now. What's nice for us to look at just be hell living
@NinniLumi *fingers crossed for azerbaijan*
@johnniew_88 Australia is dead to me. Sadly I'll be seeing him on Sunday night <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@Johanna7r kudos for ranking Russia so high though I suppose
@Johanna7r Molly was a least decent enough. But they are only voting because it's Australia. It's ridic
Why do all these jury's keep giving 12 points to Australia ... It's not even that a great of a song.
Estonia I hate you #eurojury
@ESCSamuel the screaming like a warrior are just too much
@MichaelESC @ESCSamuel song is great ... Video is pretty terrible
@JohnKarayiannis like I'm totally in London with nothing to do. <PENSIVE FACE>
Okay so I just tuned into @w12plive an hour too early ... And I got greeted with some pretty terrible 80s music ... See you guys at 8
Some douchebag toffs just got on the train drunk .... Stay away from me bitches
@Hourofwolfs and the problem being?
@gutterslush I think I could butch it up.
@megan_dave @issavienojums @anotherESCfan oh I shall need a big drink .... Doubt I'll wait until Sunday to have it though.
@gutterslush moi?? What on earth are you ins insinuating? How very dare you! I've never been so insulted in my life <SMIRKING FACE>
@megan_dave @issavienojums @anotherESCfan like suede shoes are just so fetch though.
@gutterslush I would preferred my chances than being fined for getting on the wrong train
@megan_dave @issavienojums @anotherESCfan depends how long you wait in the queue then ;)
@issavienojums @megan_dave @anotherESCfan well I have suede shoes ... FFS can this trip GET any worse??
Kinda wish I was going to Moscow now .... It probably would have been bloody cheaper #FML serious!!!!
@megan_dave @issavienojums @anotherESCfan sandal wedges In the forecasted rain? The rain the rain!!
@issavienojums these trains are tearrrrrrrrring me appppppppart whhhhhhhhy
@EurovisionEmily <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> i didn't listen to @AlexLarke I actually got on the wrong train ... I'm wet and upset now
@issavienojums @anotherESCfan @megan_dave well in still going in smart causal. Tbh I wouldn't go anywhere in the UK with trainers for night
I can't believe I got on the wrong train .... Seriously fuck my lifffffffffffffe
@anotherESCfan @issavienojums @megan_dave ahhhh thanks for the inside knowledge there ;)
@AnnSophie looking forward to hearing some others tune from you.
@NickiFrenchie will you be performing on Sunday night?
@nextofficial needs lessons in customer service in their call centres. Absolutely ridiculous
Just rang a call centre and funnily enough they treat me like an idiot .... Got nowhere .... Rang Yorkshire BS and very helpful.
@issavienojums that black tied one looks a lot better
@issavienojums something shorter in white?
@issavienojums nothing shorter?
I wonder about the sanity of people who have San Marino in their top 10 but have Azerbaijan so low ....
@Jimmy_Sax_Guy no wonders you hated me and my flag ... Azerbaijan 22nd ??? <FEARFUL FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@issavienojums blazer? Snap it on
@issavienojums or like black glitzy bolero
@issavienojums yes!! With like black cardigan?
@shining_nick @issavienojums @megan_dave oh #epicFail
You WILL wear pollaponk clothes on pollaponk day ..... Literally I will call the authorities and revoke your visa  
Love and Let Go  
@shining_nick @issavienojums @megan_dave yes weds 20th may you have to be wearing Pollaponk outfit otherwise you will be deported
@issavienojums @megan_dave like wear something like @BiancaNicholas ;)) and I'll dress like @AlexLarke #StillInLoveWithYou
@issavienojums @megan_dave I guess just leave the dolly skirts at home
@issavienojums @megan_dave like I doubt they would expect everyone is black tie
@issavienojums yeah dress and ballerinas will be fine. I think it'll be more relaxed for Sunday night anyway
@issavienojums I forgot your Moldovan trainers. So you'll have to wait until Vienna. Jesus at least I'll have room for beer on the way back
@issavienojums @megan_dave just don't pack anything sporty ... Like a dress and ballerinas will be alright ... And shit I just realised...
@issavienojums @megan_dave @anotherESCfan if usual dress codes for UK apply is probably stay away from trainers.
@megan_dave @issavienojums well im going smart casual. It's normally my standard dress anyway
Argh!!! Hay fever, how could you attack me so viciously?
@EscCro well I've been to London 6 times already this year Copenhagen 2 Sweden 3 ;))
Bags packed for London.... I think I might as well move there.
I really should start packing for London... And look for these tickets,
@rnc1966 @issavienojums we met him at the Ogae Netherlands pre party
@rnc1966 @issavienojums yup.... Then we got married.
@issavienojums @rnc1966 hey geek is in
@rnc1966 @issavienojums perfect amount of cheeky and cute
@issavienojums @rnc1966 I gave up Alex in exchange for exclusivity of Mr Cyprus
@issavienojums @rnc1966 Italy is dead to me.
@rnc1966 @issavienojums he's cute... Never really noticed it until I met him on Friday 
@issavienojums @rnc1966 hands off!!! *slaps*
@issavienojums it was amazing on stage though, one of my favourites from Saturday.
@issavienojums @rnc1966 well to be honest it's Elnur and Mr Cyprus. Got to find a nice Cypriot guy to make my family happy.
@issavienojums or Uzari ... They are trying so hard to get Belarus.
@issavienojums *quickly finds a Hungarian flag* now all I need is Elnur and I will die.
@issavienojums I'm crying.... Boggie!!!
@rnc1966 @issavienojums dark hair and dark beard is my weakness.... Only ginger beards can beat them
@LDNEurovision @boggieofficial perfection!!!!!! Omg I am so happy I have a ticket for this now....l #GoBoggie #warsForNothing <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@rnc1966 @issavienojums we can't go after the same guys you know... That would be fan girl drama at its best
@rnc1966 @issavienojums yeah I've got some random songs from before .... Nothing compares to grande Amore though.
@issavienojums @rnc1966 at least two of them are cute. What can I say... Italians are hot. Haha
@rnc1966 @issavienojums not sure why it's gathering momentum though considering I haven't seen or heard of them since San Remo
@issavienojums @NinniLumi we must all go to MF final next year
@elinadima14 I'm going to be supporting so many songs this year in the final.
@elinadima14 @issavienojums I'd love to see him do a song like this.
Hahaha @issavienojums I just got a mental image of Dima Bilan singing the hell out of Grande Amore... That would be priceless
I still have goosebumps for Italy #GrandeAmore boy I can't wait to see these guys perform the hell out of this stage.
Listening to my first play of the cut down of Grande Amore... Will it lost its appeal?
@issavienojums @rnc1966 paddy power has it second favourite at 7/2
@rnc1966 @issavienojums because she hates Italians ... Hates Italy ... Hates cheese... I dunno. I might be able to persuade her
@rnc1966 although I do love the Italian song also.
: @rnc1966 kind of hoping that Italy don't win because I know I will lose my travel wife #divorce ? @issavienojums
@rnc1966 an Azeri victory would be awesome. I would die very happy. He's my winner this year. First time I've felt so strong for a song
But it's safe to say that Belarus are staying as my number 2.
I really do love autumn leaves .... But the performance on Saturday was just so unimpressive. Really hoping he does something great
@NinniLumi like next May? Or sooner lol
I can just see it now ... Sweden over hyped and finishing 3-5 and Australia storming the win. <UNAMUSED FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
I've totally got the munchies this Morning. But I have no food in.... Guess I'm off to the shops.
BBC Three's move to online has been pushed back until 2016 now .... This is good news.
@issavienojums @LDNEurovision @UzariAndMaimuna Belarus being there would actually make my day..... No my YEAR!
#London wants you. #UK wants you.  
@Hourofwolfs ?
@critiqaltheory indeed.
Jesus, I thought this was a joke at first ...  
Starting to think about packing for #Vienna. I'm actually soooo excited. It's here!!! It's finally time.
I'm jealous <PENSIVE FACE> 
@issavienojums well i think the ViP bits are on the balcony over looking the stage. But yeah if it's raining I ain't queueing for 8 hours.
@issavienojums bring an umbrella ... Rain on Sunday :-//
Really hoping my new SIM card comes today. Really can't be doing with no phone for another 4 more days whilst I'm in London.
@issavienojums it's pretty much gone. One of those 48 hour colds. I blame waiting out in the cold in Amsterdam.
Happy St George's Day to all my fellow English patriots
Looking forward to @w12plive tonight whilst I'm on the train to London.
Isn't love a funny thing ....
Jesus even my cat is sneezing now ... She got my germs.
@EscCro taking pollaponk day to a whole new level
@EV_FAN_ESC @EurovisionEmily oh and I mean gladiolus in an awesome way ;)
@EscCro yes miss ponk
Do it!!!! We need more awesomeness in London. And uzari &amp; maimuna are just 10000% awesome.  
@EurovisionEmily and they big are such genuinely nice people. I would love to have a friend like alex, hilarious. Especially when drunk ;)
@EurovisionEmily yeah I really hope they do well. After meeting them both on Saturday I can really tell they want this.
@EscCro @Pollaponk where the hell you gonna be wearing a slip?
@EurovisionEmily I bet. They are both such sweeties.
Ill with flu but I still made it a few hours with the friends. Must get better before Saturday please. 
Home after dinner with the friends.... And I've taken my flu meds and I'm back in bed.... Rock n roll as they say
Aww that's so sweet Bianca x  
@anotherESCfan I probably would have if I wasn't in awe so much :))
@EscCro @Pollaponk I have pink boxers and socks ;)
@johnniew_88 aww shame.
@EscCro @Pollaponk the forecast is for rain ... So I wouldn't bother... Maybe a ponk umbrella ;)
Out with the besties for #beer and #burger oh yeah. 
@johnniew_88 yeah she was brilliant. And so funny at the after party. Did you manage to talk to her?
@goaround99 @MichaelESC I would love to see a choir though.
Ahhhh nice cool beer for £3 for a pint .... Beats paying 3euros for a half .... @issavienojums like how the hell do we get so drunk??
@goaround99 @MichaelESC otherwise what's the point of having someone on stage if their not singing SONG contest
@goaround99 @MichaelESC nah I believe you shouldn't count backing singers
@goaround99 @MichaelESC although it Azerbaijan this year  arrived with a 100 piece choir for the last minute of the song it would slay
@goaround99 @MichaelESC 10,000 would be better but yeah I don't agree with the 6 performer rule. I mean more doesn't always mean better
@issavienojums @SchlagerKaty if this isn't you fan girling over UK then it's just plain stalking <SMIRKING FACE>
Seeing as I didn't have one whilst in Netherlands .... Might as well drink to Amsterdam 
@issavienojums @SchlagerKaty you mean you can't fan girl over UK, Moldova or Cyprus? I am shocked
I guess I'm going to have to get up. Still not feeling 100% but beer and burger is calling for me.
@issavienojums I know right? I had to even pull your hand up to wave your flag during Moldova at one point.... Where was the love?
@issavienojums two Azeri flags you can see @anotherESCfan and me showing the Azeri love. I'm surprised I didn't cry when I saw him on stage
@BelChi90 I know right? I've been crying all day. #RIPTinkerbell
Not enough wants in the world to show how much I want #Azerbaijan to win this year 
And here is bojana stealing the show. 
Kinda if wish I back there.... Nadav smashed it. 
Hmm I know it's s long way off .... But i guess we should pack umbrellas for #vienna2015 . 
@dreurovision @issavienojums then you will have to look out for my Azeri one then. ;)
@dawnwarcup28 aww best night tonight then. Chicken Wednesday. #WinnerWinnerChickenDinner
@dawnwarcup28 most definitely ... I even forgot what a pint of strongbow tastes like ;)
@issavienojums although we have to go to the marathon with flags for @dreurovision which one do you want us to wave?
@issavienojums to be honest I want to see some of the marathon too so I wasn't planning on all day queueing
@SimonJCOfficial thanks for the follow
@issavienojums but Boggie won't see us ... Oh wait she's not going to be there <PENSIVE FACE>
@issavienojums but hey they keep us mildly warm whisky waiting outside for 8 hours.
@issavienojums make sure you bring it to London ... We need to support I'm still in love with you. I think it's going to get into my top 10
Off to get my travel guides today for Budapest and Prague .... Exciting times. Then it's beer and burger with @dawnwarcup28 #ohyeah
@issavienojums do you still have my Union Jack?
Still In Love With You is fast approaching my top 10. I reckon after I see them in London on Sunday, they'll be up there.
#ExtremeRussia even animals love Putin <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> oh boy
Although tbh I really want a Putin Russian Doll
Jesus Christ I'm only 3 minutes into Extreme Russia ... And I already feel sick. This is effing crazy.
Talks about going to Russia then starts to watch Reggie Yates Extreme Russia .... This is all kinds of wrong.
@issavienojums @anotherESCfan at least it's your birthday!!! Plus you get to open you present when you get to London. Sadly it's not Alex
@issavienojums @anotherESCfan although running off to Russia with Elnur is probably not he wisest thing to do.
@issavienojums @anotherESCfan when I marry Sabina I will take her money then, and run away with Elnur.
@anotherESCfan @issavienojums sadly I shall be sat in a conference room in London instead. <PENSIVE FACE>
@anotherESCfan @issavienojums perhaps when I join Azerbaijan delegation next year they can pay.
@issavienojums @anotherESCfan yes anyone else want to come?? <SMIRKING FACE>
@issavienojums @anotherESCfan flight back would be £1000 ... Dead
@issavienojums @anotherESCfan oh shit yeah.... Breaking my heart, I don't understand.
@anotherESCfan don't!!!! I'm actually looking for cheap flights as it is.
Why am I not going to Russia this weekend??? This is all kinds of wrong ness.
@LoreenatorDK @BelChi90 yes please :D tell him to watch out for #teamWolf in Vienna ;p
As soon as I take my medication I feel pretty good... 4 hours later dreadful. I need my mess in constant drip please.
@LoreenatorDK @BelChi90 yeah lol. He's too cute. He's going to russia right?
@BelChi90 indeed.
@LoreenatorDK @BelChi90 well I chose wrong... Because my bae doesn't seem to be going to London <PENSIVE FACE>
@BelChi90 he's labour... He doesn't have any,.. He's all about the poor man
@BelChi90 he's a douche
@BelChi90 @LoreenatorDK wow have fun in Russia. I'm so jealous, I really wanted to go to this one.
@BelChi90 <UNAMUSED FACE><BROKEN HEART>
It kind of feels like I've won the Hungarian lottery. Look at all those 0's  #budapest2015 
Kinda hoping I don't feel this ill later. Supposed to be going for dinner with my besties, who I haven't seen in months.
@issavienojums @shining_nick I love Italian cheese :))
@issavienojums at least I got Valentina for San Marino :))
Aww Filippa would have been great though.  
@lnrhsynv is Elnur coming to @LDNEurovision ?? I'm still praying
@issavienojums message them about Boggie. I keep asking but nothing. She's in London ffs
Hopefully get to meet Mørland this time.  
@issavienojums Norway for LEP now too :D
@LDNEurovision we want Boggie!!!!! She's in London anyway ... Make it happen!!
@issavienojums @shining_nick no one can deny that he can perform.... Otherwise they are blind.
@shining_nick @issavienojums 2013 for me. But yeah the Facebook song was that years wtf song
@issavienojums @shining_nick she probably wasn't even in my top 10 last year tbh
@shining_nick @issavienojums I love Moldova purely for the dancing.
@issavienojums @shining_nick because Michele broke my heart ..., he's breaking my hearttttt I don't understandddddd
@shining_nick @issavienojums it would have been 10000% fan Wank but it Would have soooo good
@issavienojums exactly... I wanted O-sole intorno a me part 2
@shining_nick perhaps it was all the Dutch people I follow.., quite why they love this but hated CATS is beyond me
@shining_nick I literally can't stand it. I never really got why everyone loved it.
I wanted big camp fest from Michele, but ..... No 
@shining_nick Malta has a big fat 0 along with Netherlands for me.
@shining_nick 4/5 probably the only one I have higher is Greece but marginally.
@shining_nick I prefer years that are like this ... Polarised.
@shining_nick too true, the national finals weren't that good in general. There was quite a lot of rubbish fillers.
@joanaplucas I wonder how many votes they get each year?
@shining_nick like I have definite favourites ... Whereas last year I didn't really.
@shining_nick I think it's really strange that everyone is changing their mind on this years songs and actually it's quite a good year
@shining_nick Italy <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@joanaplucas yeah let's face it it's mainly the causal fans you need to appeal to ... Because majority fans are usually there.
Hera Bjork at #EFC ..... Fan bloody tastic!!!
@joanaplucas I think it shows the power of that song. It's going to have a massive following from casual fans.
House hunting in Budapest this morning. I am actually serious about this now.
@stuart11 @jasonbetts yeah the feel at home thing is a big plus. Plus I get unlimited internet
@issavienojums when we move to Budapest.
@issavienojums agreed. But hey... I won money on her qualifying :))
@issavienojums @EurovisionEmily well she should have qualified with crisalide ... I guess maybe was just payback.
@issavienojums @EurovisionEmily she's going to be back.... And we allllll know it.
@issavienojums @EurovisionEmily come on We all would have preferred her again instead of chain of hearts. Surely???? 
“@issavienojums: @Refshaleoen @EurovisionEmily Fuck San Marino!” Queen valentina
@EurovisionEmily @issavienojums San Marino qualified :D that's what happened.  Whoop!!!!
@issavienojums @EurovisionEmily hahaha I still love it. Got to love a good old 90s dance routine. I used to live for them.
@Johanna7r @issavienojums but it's sooooo annoying. I find it hard to last 3 minutes with it.
@EurovisionEmily @issavienojums something that has never been done before in #eurovision we think he's gonna enter from the ceiling. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@issavienojums @EurovisionEmily well we're still waiting for this big surprise he's been promising soooooooooo
@Johanna7r @issavienojums I'll see how she takes it on Sunday... Then I'll decide if she beats Netherlands or not.
@issavienojums @Johanna7r yeah Belgium is 23 for me.
@EurovisionEmily @issavienojums although I am very sick of seeing the Same performances for like the 100th time
@issavienojums @EurovisionEmily his live vocals actually don't differ that much from the studio. I don't get the hate seriously.
@shambletina well I'm hoping for Baku ;))
@Johanna7r @issavienojums I would have even preferred the nuns....
@Johanna7r @issavienojums like what the hell did they do to that song after the revamp? I was in utter shock. Why would you do that??
@shambletina aww shame. Well I'll drink for you then ;) hope to see you next year then.
@issavienojums @Johanna7r  Lawrence gray should have won
@Johanna7r @issavienojums Malta used to be okay ..... Then they changed it .... #epicFail she's gonna see my grumpy face too on Sunday
@issavienojums @Johanna7r you are dead to me. Ill oximate you whilst I can
@issavienojums @Johanna7r it even over took Malta as my worst this weekend... Let's see if Amber can regain her bottom spot this week
@shambletina are you coming to Vienna btw?
@issavienojums @Johanna7r Netherlands is the biggest fan wank to me.... It's dreadful
@issavienojums @Johanna7r aww :-( I hate supporting fanwanks... But I can't help it with Israel
@Johanna7r it's high on my rankings too.... But I just think fanwanking and a 16yr old boy just is wrong mannnnnn
@shambletina oh I choose carola every time. But at least Elisabeth is mad as a hatter, and such a sweet lady when I met her on Saturday
@Johanna7r but yes I agree with Albania and Belgium... #fanwank material
@Johanna7r www israel can't possibly be a fanwank song surely? Like it's just a party song that everyone loves and hates at the same time.
Can't stop listening to I evighet since Saturday. She Elizabeth was just perfect. 
SOMEONE BROKE MY HEAAART AGAAAIN
@blanketperson @issavienojums @Johanna7r @EV_FAN_ESC ooh lovely. Indeed share the moment with us
@EV_FAN_ESC @Johanna7r @issavienojums it bugged me.
@Johanna7r @issavienojums @EV_FAN_ESC he was pretty much like "I'm here I'm so good why don't you have the right equipment" whilst on stage
@Johanna7r @issavienojums @EV_FAN_ESC well I don't hate him... There's just 32 songs I like more. It's mainly his attitude I don't like
@issavienojums @Johanna7r @EV_FAN_ESC I've never been anywhere in Germany so I, good for anywhere
@issavienojums @Johanna7r @EV_FAN_ESC oh and I have him at #33 :-0
@issavienojums @Johanna7r @EV_FAN_ESC I'll happily go to Germany next year. Cologne ??
@Arianna483 @issavienojums although when I bought take that tickets for the  stadhalle I got the option then too.
@Arianna483 @issavienojums I think maybe it only had that option for Ogae tickets....
@Arianna483 @issavienojums yeah I had the option of picking them up at the venue for 3 euros....Gladly did so rather than pay 30 for postage
@Arianna483 @issavienojums I won't know mine until the 10th May when I go to Vienna to pick them up.
@issavienojums @Arianna483 do you know yours?
@issavienojums @Arianna483 tbh we could be panicking p for nothing. We might all get the same.
@issavienojums @Arianna483 it's really not worth the risk.
@opeurovision @issavienojums @Sophieeeeeeeeej yup that's where you'll find
@issavienojums @opeurovision @Sophieeeeeeeeej let's face it Georgia is going to wipe the floor with Malta.
@issavienojums @ESCtomato @shining_nick @TimWalksAlong well I hope that too.
@ESCtomato @shining_nick @TimWalksAlong @issavienojums well hopefully we'll know at least some people in the queue with us.
I am feeling even more terrible now.... Thus better not turn into full flu. I've got stuff to doooooo
@mr_gerbear @eurovicious @timehop can hardly believe it's been a year already.
Well in shocked that they only gave 10 considering the artist is from Sweden. #shockHorror #oslo1996 Ireland wins of course.
Anyone points from Sweden this time? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #oslo1996
@ESCtomato @shining_nick @TimWalksAlong so basically there is Sud or nord tickets Probably two different entrances. Splitting q buddies up <BROKEN HEART>
@ESCtomato @shining_nick @TimWalksAlong some kind of bridge splitting the standing people into two groups 
@BelChi90 of course I should blame it on the disco
@BelChi90 too much fun in Amsterdam... That what I blame it on.
@ESCtomato @shining_nick @TimWalksAlong let me find he picture
@ESCtomato @shining_nick @TimWalksAlong there's apparently a bridge for the beginning. So artists can get to the green room at the back.
I'm pretty much losing my voice. The joys
@shining_nick @TimWalksAlong @ESCtomato I thought bridges were supposed to bring people together... But really it's doing quite the opposite
@shining_nick @TimWalksAlong @ESCtomato i don't mind it. What I don't like is that me and my group might be split lup because of this bridge
