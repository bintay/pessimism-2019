@TahaShahid we don't rely on Ross as much as other players either, the solution to every loss is not to trade Ross
Gay situation and get someone who doesn't wanna be here and plays like shit.
Am I excusing the way Ross has been playing? No. But the solution to every problem isn't to trade him, you could end up with a Salmons or
I'll just leave this here. 
@TahaShahid and why is that? Because they suck no? So why keep them?
#WaiveFields #WaiveHansborough #WaiveHayes
@TahaShahid why haven't we traded Fields? Hansborough? Hayes?
Ever wanted to kick in somebody's front teeth?
I'm just soooo done twitter is just giving me bare joke today <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
LOL so we're blaming our entire defence on Ross?
LOOOOOOL you guys kill me tbh
LOOOOOL are you confused?!
Honestly yo even play Steisma like something has to work bro!
Lol I thought everybody knew this already 
I keep forgetting girls aren't allowed to tweet about sports, my apologies twitta .
@TahaShahid so is Fields and Hansborough but they been here forever so as I said, it won't be.
But again I'm a girl so I shouldn't even be talking.
It's crazy how every time we lose its Ross' fault <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> yes cause the whole reason we're losing the series is cause of Terrence
It won't be. 
crazy how many "real Raptors fans" are suddenly Wizards fans, but I'm a girl so I don't know nothing right? I'll just stop talking.
Hansborough lookin real tired
It's not time to take Hansborough out?
Good defence bae !
at this point, put in Bruno like I'm so done <SLEEPY FACE>
Im just being soooo optimistic right now
leaving work early, I'm in no mood to work today

@nihalamalik lmaaoo <FACE THROWING A KISS><TWO HEARTS>
@nihalamalik no argument there
@nihalamalik is even relevant to begin with.
@nihalamalik oh for sure, I don't support what Khloe said at all. I just personally don't see why Amber's opinion on the situation
@nihalamalik I get that but stripping wasn't her only option, it was just the easiest choice that's what people aren't understanding.
@nihalamalik i get what you're saying but that honestly wasn't her only option, let's be honest.
Kylie isn't teaching young girls that it's okay to date older men, that's on their parents stop trynna blame celebrities for everything.
They all lack morals get over it.
Y'all acting like there aren't other jobs Amber could have done other than stripping to help her mom out. (3)
They were born into different financial situations, what they had to do or chose to do based on that is on them. (2)
Let me just play devil's advocate for a second. How can you compare Amber's life at 15 to Kylie's? (1)
Lol why is Amber's opinion on Tyga &amp; Kylie even relevant?
@mellla_ she's puts being a business lady and a opportunist before being a mother, sad but it works.
Lol people spend so much time hating on celebrities who don't even give a damn about them. Keep hating they still making money <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

‚Äú@aziamalayzia: ‚Äú@tara_flannagan: Truth hurts nobody likes niggers‚Äù quoting just incase u delete this later‚Äù <NEUTRAL FACE> no she didn't‚Ä¶
@Trey_Richards I do
the fact that Darren Wilson said his conscience is clear after killing Mike Brown and he'd "do it again"‚Ä¶he should be stripped of his badge<UNAMUSED FACE>
I got a whole month off from school and nothing to do ...

really trying to have a good day today .. really trying not to go crazy!
Dear ignorant white people, karma is a bitch ‚Ä¶
@jayymicae you know the justice system is messed up right? But like I said I digress , it's in God's hands ‚Ä¶
@jayymicae but vengeance is mine saith the Lord, so I digress ‚Ä¶
@jayymicae they don't deserve to lose their lives and not get justice based on circumstantial evidence? He was murdered end of story‚Ä¶
@jayymicae so it's okay that this officer is "innocent"? But if a civilian shot someone who assaulted them they'd be guilty?
@jayymicae too late !
police are taught to shoot to injure not to kill, end of discussion, y'all try to have a good night.
@_MaegJC okay, thanks.
@_MaegJC you guys hiring for winter session at Balmoral ?
i cannot believe the amount of ignorant crap i'm seeing tonight, but why am i surprised?
you shoulda never brought us here Lesli? bitch, we built the damn white house, invented the traffic light and much more, don't forget it.
@MikeWhikehart_ i'm sure if you were innocently murdered by a cop and the cop walked free, your friends &amp; family would be outraged too
@MikeWhikehart_ no one says that...
who in the hell is this LesliFrye chick ? her tweets make me absolutely sick.
@MikeWhikehart_ i'm just asking, but like understand the outrage, people are sick of the cops murdering people and yet they're innocent.
@AFRICAAN_AFRO boy bye ..
@MikeWhikehart_ i never said it was okay, but are you trying to justify cops killing civilians? like innocent 12 year old boys?
@MikeWhikehart_ yeah, but justice is served when cops are killed by civilians. cops kill a civilian and its as if they're above the law.

"Nothing"

"Damn Me Too" 
Father can you hear me? I'm calling on your name ...
white people never wanna admit when race is involved, i'm not even surprised man ...
your a grown ass man and a little boy playing with a toy is a threat to you? punk ass.
white people always wanna use black on black crime to justify the police's actions, black people actually get arrested, cops don't.
Hate the justice system , really do .
Why are everyone's goals relationship oriented ? Y'all don't want money and success ? Good health? Nah ? Ok cool .
If you feel you need to ask if you can show people that your girl is bae then you're not the only nigga , she must be droppin hints ..
