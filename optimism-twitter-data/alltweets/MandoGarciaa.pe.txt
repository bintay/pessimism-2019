@dhatkidant duh, i made a scene when he took them off lmfao
I wish people would blow up my phone
Why am I awake
@dhatkidant I was stupid lol he told me that was as good as they were going to get but my new orthodontist said he lied
@dhatkidant my overbite, my front two teeth and the gap I have on one of my lower teeth from the tooth that got extracted
This bitch from school makes videos of her ranting about random shit and it's so annoying like #reasonswhyibarelygoonfb
u wanna be bae? Yes or na? Yes? Ok
I want you to be my bae
@dhatkidant oh yah lol it's all good I'm getting braces tomorrow once again and with a different ortho
I'm a good person for liking pictures on IG of a bitch who didn't like me in hs
@dhatkidant well he told me that he was going to fix everything like no overbite and perfectly straight teeth but I still have an overbite
@dhatkidant no for fucking up my teeth and having to get braces again
I'm surprised that I've been in a good mood all day
Can I sue my old orthodontist??
I don't know why I decided to go to an orthodontist that's 40 minutes away
Exactly 4 months until my birthday :)
@dhatkidant oops
