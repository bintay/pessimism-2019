Leeds gets its Balls out. Surely nothing more than a huge Labour reshuffle on the cards.
Miliband resignation guesses in the office... I've gone with 10:20am
@Mercury_Gaby good god, don't you actually die if you go 3 hours without one?
Poor old @Mercury_Gaby still stuck out at her count #pray4Gaby
196 votes were rejected #HertsElec
Incidentally, North East Herts had a 70.93% turnout, a very slight increase on 2010 #HertsElec
Candidate reaction, including @OliverHeald2015's plans, as Tories hold North East Herts 
@MercuryMichaelH any comment?
Right, candidates caught up with. Back to Mercury HQ to piece it all together #HertsElec
NE HERTS: Con 28,949, Lab 9,869, Ukip 6728, Lib 3,952 Green 2,789 #HertsElec
BREAKING: Conservatives hold North East Hertfordshire #HertsElec
I still haven't tracked down Green candidate @DrMarioMay - I suspect this may be something to do with his teaching job #HertsElec
From the naked eye I've got #Labour just edging out #Ukip - still a little way to go. Looks like a #LibDem bloodbath #HertsElec
The canteen we're in directly overlooks the votes piles, not particularly discrete. You could build a fort out of Sir Oliver's #HertsElec
We may be looking at a result closer to 4 than 3, counters continue to beever away #HertsElec
I'm now older than an MP. Eurghhhhh. #HertsElec
Groups of party campaigners glued to TV. Labour faces looking pretty glum, unsurprising with current national forecasts #HertsElec
@bobster76 our man @MercuryMichaelH is your point of call for all things Stevenage
He outlined widening A1(M) and radiotherapy at Lister as priorities. Will talk more on specifics if (when) he's elected #HertsElec
.@OliverHeald2015, arriving fashionably late. Tells me that, although he's not been complacent, he has already started planning #HertsElec
Counting process is underway. It's going to be a close-run thing between Sir Oliver Heald, The Conservatives and The Tories #HertsElec
@MercuryNewsEd drowning in a flume's splashpool would be quite something, even if I wasn't the proud owner of THREE Frosties badges
@MercuryEwan @MercuryEwan mmm, plus you need to go see a certain soap star in the morning, regardless of who's in Number 10!
As the future of our nation is decided downstairs, I'm trying to work out whether I can sneak on the flume #HertsElec 
@MercuryEwan only teasing, I know you wouldn't have missed election night lightly. It's like Popeye missing the World Spinach Festival
@Mercury_Gaby it's more tempting to shout random numbers to put them off, I think
@MercuryEwan Night, Sicknote. Your former Crow editor, Les, sends his wellwishes!
Had an estimated finish time of 3/4. However, verification was due to be done by 12 and that hasn't happened, could be a late one #HertsElec
This seat seems so safe the Tories may as well have it guarded with iron gates, laser turrets and ravenous Alsatians #HertsElec
Caught up with #Labour's @ChrisYorkUK who is also aiming for a "close second" - no underdogs seem to have even considered a win  #HertsElec
No sign of any other candidates quite yet but Labour enthusiasts here are paying no attention to exit poll #HertsElec
He describes THAT tuition fee decision as "putting the country before the party" #HertsElec
#LibDem's @geekofhearts happy with campaign but says "No Lib Dem can be optimistic tonight" and would be pleased to keep 30 seats #HertsElec
Candidates are starting to arrive. #Ukip's William Compton has told me he thinks polls may not reflect "shy" Ukip voters #HertsElec
@jakehpsauce haha, a vote for 17 black is a vote for the people
@jakehpsauce it was a scatty vote. Judging by the polls, though, I think I got the wrong answer.
@IanRidley1 ha, thanks. does it bring back any memories for you, or did you go straight into sport?
In 2010, Sir Oliver Heald strolled this seat for the Tory's with 53.5% of the votes, with nearest rivalsLib Dems) 30% behind

@OliGraham1 it's clearly what's referred to as a "typo". the point about you being an embarrassment of a football club remains the same.

@MercuryAnton nope, nor public transport cuts

That's a wrap. Apologies for the notifications, gents! @OliverHeald2015 @geekofhearts @gcw09
On tuition fees @OliverHeald2015 and @geekofhearts point out that, despite raises, people pay less through restructured system
.@OliverHeald2015 again praise work of Government getting into work. @gcw09 says Greens would scrap tuition fees
On the first question to actually do with Buntingford (library) fair to say all three tiptoed around it a bit
EU: @OliverHeald2015 and @gcw09 want in-out referendum (but would prefer to stay in) @geekofhearts passionate about staying in
@OliverHeald2015 says economy is only one improving through Tory policies and changing tact would be "huge mistake"
On UK poverty: @gcw09 wants minimum wage of £10. @geekofhearts says scrap tax for those earning &gt;12.5k
. @OliverHeald2015 points out 5% of NHS contracted out under Labour, now 6.5%
.@gcw09 "horror stories" of backed-up ambulances. NHS would funded through corporation tax, taxing riches, and scrapping Trident and HS2
.@geekofhearts says Lib Dems would use mansion tax to fund extra £8bn for NHS
NHS... @OliverHeald2015 calls it finest health services in the world but is not asked about privatisation
Would be a mistake to scrap it due to "uncertain world" @OliverHeald2015
"We would be better of spending £100 on cardboard missiles" says @geekofhearts as any nuking breaks international laws
On Trident, @gcw09 says it's time we realised UK not major superpower and scrap it
@ChrisYorkUK well feel free to Tweet me some views!
On subject of future invasions, @gcw09 says "we are responsible for IS". Brings few gasps/chuckles among audience
.@gcw09: "maybe we should stop bombing them and droning them"
More help needed to make other countries where refugees are coming from, says @OliverHeald2015
More refugees should be allowed to settle in UK and Herts to escape conflict, says @geekofhearts
On voting age to 16, @geekofhearts and @gcw09 says yes, can join army and marry.. @OliverHeald2015 however believes will mean lower turnout
Lib Dems' @geekofhearts says he does not want houses on outskirts of town. Wants a new Garden City in Herts
Opening speech from @gcw09 (actually Stevenage candidate) says lower carbon footprint among Green's key policies
Things kicked off by @OliverHeald2015 who says he would like to see a light railway return to the town, serving Baldock and Royston

@MercurySara_G's last hour at the Mercury, temporarily leaving East Herts entirely in my hands. It's not too late to change your mind!
The incredible survival story of WWII veteran from Ware 
11-year-old Hertford girl is a cut above the rest, having her hair turned into a wig for charity 
ICYMI - big news from outside East Herts in Mercury land this morn as Tesco announced it would leave its Cheshunt HQ 
Inquiry is now closed. Planning inspector John Braithwaite tells me decision will be in no more than 5 weeks.
Mr Shadarevian says it is "unanswerable" that we would not be at this appeal had council noticed reasons for evidence withdrawal
"It cannot reasonably be said that that the negative factors demonstrably and significantly outweigh the clearly established benefits"
"proposals will introduce a younger population, integrating new families into an aging population, including families of a range of means"
"The council has behaved entirely inconsistently in relation to these proposals and those by Fairview in relation to the Sainsbury's site"
"Council itself recognizes the role which Buntingford has to play in meeting housing needs of district, not merely indigenous needs"
"Housing situation remains dire"
"Current housing supply is at the very best 3.3 years, possibly less"
Potential for 800 houses didn't include these houses but included 56 homes on Aspenden Road, which "should be discounted" due to refusal
"There is a positive commitment to provide 2 hectares of employment land on Sainsbury's depot site and Buntingford Business Park of 3 hect."
Mr Shadarevian: "The chronic shortfall has not improved in the past year"
Mr Shadarevian now giving his closing statement on behalf of Wheatley
"It is time that the tide turned for Buntingford"
Mr Jameson says inspector has "every ability to dismiss these appeals"
"How will people travel? Not by public transport... at best we will have a temporary subsidised service"
Mr Jameson: We are already well above the previous inspectors 800-house threshold"
Robert Jameson now delivering his closing statement for Buntingford and Rule 6 parties
#Buntingford inquiry back underway. Discussion of conditions (the formal ironing out of documents) happening, before closing statements
Inquiry now on lunch, closing statements to come this afternoon #Buntingford
Mr Spears: "If ever there was a case of David vs Goliath, this is it"
Paul Spears, Aspenden Parish Council chair, labels EHDC's last-minute evidence withdrawal as 'disgusting' (
Mr Reeves says he has not met a single person in the town who supports these developments
Resident Monty Reeves now points out he and his wife moved to Buntingford "because of it's tranquility and community spirit"
Mr Jones refers to one incident where school pupil was offered place in Nazeing, Essex, roughly 45 minutes away
Mr Jones: "We could potentially be surrounded by new developments with no improvements to facilities other than the promise of money"
He points out that, in the worst-case situation for them where all applications are granted, the town would double in size
District councillor for Buntingford Ward, Jeff Jones, speaking on that behalf
"Perhaps they knew what the public reaction would be," he says.
another resident, who mumbled a name I will have to catch later, says Wheatley did not carry out a public consultation on either development
Mr Waite also notes that #Buntingford's schools are currently the largest employers in the town
In ref to schools strain cites a Mercury article: pupil missed 5 schoo weeks as forced outside town with no transport 
He mentions that these developments will be "tipping point" for town, with so many others already on the way
Mr Waite: "With the greatest respect to the company, even Poundland wouldn't move there"
Mr Waite reiterates points about strain on education, GPs being stretched and lack of bus and rail services being unattractive for employers
Mr Waite is today, however, speaking merely as a resident
Third parties will now speak - starting with Buntingford Town councillor Graham Waite
all below quotes from this morning described by Paul Shadarevian, representing the appellant, as "largely rebuttle evidence and moot points"
Stephen Baker, planner and Buntingford resident concludes his evidence by mentioning high accident figures on A507 and A10 coming into town
"Already pressure for new places at schools for existing residents in the current years and its going to get worse with 800 houses coming"
"There is pressure on service across the town there are waiting lists at doctors &amp; dentist"
Wheatley has offered to support 'Hopper' bus service but this only takes people around Buntingford, does not get people in and out of town
“There is no chance” of houses bringing the sort of level bus service suggested in Robert Parker’s evidence yesterday, esp. with CC cuts
"Buntingford has no synergy or close relationships with other towns"... poor state of town's broadband also unattractive for employers
"No guarantee" that employers will take up the employment land on offer -"it is an attractive place to live but poor place for employers"
Some land set out for employment sites already given permission for houses to be built, figure for new jobs could be as low as 600 or 700
argued that assumptions that estimate of 1,000 jobs being created must be taken with a "pinch of salt"
according to the 2011 Census, only 25 people in #Buntingford caught the bus to work - houses will have "significant impact" on roads in town
public transport being slammed, bus services "poor" - especially with Herts CC cutting buses after 7 30 and consulting over weekend services
Rule 6 parties arguing employment has already suffered since the Sainsbury's depot closed (which is also now being turned into houses)
"Local employment not sufficient to sustain the working population" he noted at the time, when 100 further homes were granted last year
it's been noted that the officer for Wheatley's appeal on their previous project last year was not optimistic about employment prospects
back at the #Buntingford public inquiry - evidence currently being given by residents why Wheatley's appeal for 180 homes should be denied
that concludes the appellant's (Wheatley Developments) case. Rule 6 Parties (B'ford people) to speak tomorrow. Inquiry adjourned til 9.30am.
Mr Keymer: "no doubt this development will attract economically developed families. it will be a bigger community but a more vibrant one"
He accepts that higher and middle levels schools in the town would need to be expanded
Mr Keymer: "I find it difficult to see the negatives other than the response from residents"
Mr Keymer: E. Herts Council has no 5-year housing plan. Solution to fixing this isn't in green belt (where all other towns bar B'ford lie)
Surveyor Edward Keymer currently discussing the 'chronic' national housing shortfall. authorities under great pressure from govt. to sort it
He also suggested earlier that a larger population would increase the chances of an improved bus service for #Buntingford
Mr Parker says properties are within walking distance of main services and more properties will increase trade for these services
at public inquiry regarding 180 new homes in #Buntingford, Robert Parker of Peter Brett Associates argues traffic effect will be minimal

@crstig @Mordwand perhaps it's a football-wide issue. in relative terms we have soul though &amp; it's nowt to do with our success
@Mordwand @crstig and I feel equally sorry for you for your lack of enthusiasm.
@crstig @Mordwand maybe I'll agree in 10 years time but I'm at FL grounds every week and the atmosphere is not as 'soulful'. Rant over!
@crstig @Mordwand you're clearly just attached to team you grew up with.  Benali, Dodd etc apparently 'had less soul than Paine and Channon'
@crstig @Mordwand maybe I'm lucky to be young enough to go to the Dell 3 times but I'm proud to support a club thriving with a soul.
@crstig @Mordwand define 'soul'. Top 5 home crowd? 4 or 5 (inc JWP &amp; SG) academy players in squads? Constant remembrance of late saviour?

Words cannot describe how happy I am for Morgan Schneiderlin. 5 years and 2 months ago he was being relegated from the Championship #santsfc
@ConnorArmstrong I'm looking forward to the new annual tradition of arguments between #teamstripes and #teamnostripes
Also, Rickie Lambert's magic lamp strikes again! His playing time next year has just gone up by 75%
Currently picturing a TV show where Suarez &amp; Pepe are locked in a small room together for 3 weeks.
@JoshJohnson_5 also Keane wasn't provoked in heat of the moment it was pre-meditated by a long-standing grudge. Surely worse by your logic?
@JoshJohnson_5 it makes no difference. Suarez should get 1 year global ban which is what Cantona got &amp; what Keane should have got.
@JoshJohnson_5 I don't understand, generic comments about mothers are a meaningless everyday thing, should be big enough to walk away
@JoshJohnson_5 you've said some things in your time but surely, SURELY you're not defending kicking a fan in the face over a your mum joke?
REF!!!!!
If reports in French media are true, looking forward to seeing Schneiderlin start for France tomorrow #saintsfc

Really held my professional neck out there for the first time against a lotta opposition to say we'll still qualify.
Cannot stand the plebs writing off. Uruguay and Costa Rica are so much more there for the taking. We still have a good qualification chance.

Modric, Kovacic, Rakitic. How many teams boast a midfield that good? Croatia are genuine dark horses.

Holland are a weird, weird team... Starting eleven tonight had Robben &amp; van Persie mixed with Ron Vlaar and Leroy Fer.
all this midfield performance has done has highlight how important Jordan Henderson's energy will actually be to England
Barkley and the Ox making the biggest claims so far, no question.

@kieranbeckles I enjoyed the insightful commentary - "oh my god, oh my god... oh my god... oh my god, oh my god... oh my god"
@PubTalkForum not necessarily, didn't happen when Suarez wanted to go last summer and Lallana has far greater emotional ties than he did
...this brings about a dip in form but our success isn't compromised as Gaston finally steps up, leaving Adam a bit-part player! #saintsfc
Lallana signing a Liverpool makes me hope they won't match our valuation, he is stripped of the captaincy and has to stay... #saintsfc
Seriously, all this time watching Malinga bowling at the death, WHY do we keep banging it in short?! Blockhole = one tops #EngvSL

Can't help feeling he's getting a little carried away with himself. J-Rod's goals and 13 clean sheets were just as big in us finishing 8th.
Looks like 8 years of superb service from Adam Lallana is on the verge of ending very sourly. What a shame.
Looks like the Premier League could lose 3 of its (for me) top 5 ever players in one summer in Giggs, Lampard and Ferdinand. Brutal.

@JohnnyBEEVER if it was a done deal a month ago... Why is it not actually a done deal? When a Saints journo sat Lambert may be the only...
@JohnnyBEEVER I wouldn't believe the Shaw done deal stuff just because Mark Ogden said it on MUTV. The man's got column inches to sell.
@JohnnyBEEVER 500?! Transfers are a dodgy market, Kroos-United was 1/4! Im annoyed you've done that, hate wanting mates to be out of pocket!
@JohnnyBEEVER the fire sale isn't happening, especially if Poch stays which is apparently the case. 1 will go tops, won't be Lovren

If you ever needed ax example of why taking Carroll to the WC over Lambert would be ludicrous
Really been struggling for goals since J-Rod's injury, so great for Alcaraz to make the step up
@paddybarclay Jose Font or Fontay? Commentators suddenly changed their minds last season
That question about next season was the first time I've ever heard Poch not start his answer with 'Si...'

@gabicox12 I know, I was sinking drinks I don't even like &amp; belt out songs I don't even know for Paddy's... surrounded by Englishmen haha
Only just been made aware it's St George's day. England seriously needs to take a leaf out of the Irish book!
19th century football that Jose
@AndrewGreaves84 congratulations!
Next game kicks off in 10 minutes, class!
If there's one man who can turn this around it's Neil Adams
Oh good god I've forgotten my headphones <POUTING FACE> lonnnnng 4 hours in store
Southbound and excited!
@DavidBondBBC if anyone was going to get to the bottom of spying claims, it had be Bond!
Will always be the Bale who bent in that free-kick at Pride Park to me 
You're welcome Madrid #saintsfc
Pinto looks like a Native American chief someone has stuck a souvenir goalkeeping shirt on
Did Barca just score from a set piece?!
@AndrewGreaves84 @NeilBonnarBN I hope so, for the FA Cup tie and the fact we have each other's town/city to thank for our best strikers!
@AndrewGreaves84 @NeilBonnarBN quite possibly, in 5 points time mind!
@NeilBonnarBN even if Rodgers wins the league with the worst team in history?
@JoshJohnson_5 and won? I'm not surprised tbh, you're a lover of all things nonsense!
You would also be a HORRID punter haha “@JoshJohnson_5: If u had palace/Sunderland bts win someone would be going sick right now”
@michaelmufc3 @DrSimonWilliams @sam_fenn @WillStone49 como estas la San Miguel por favor? <OPEN BOOK>
@Rafferty1875 not watching what you're watching but did Winterburn 'pull a real rabbit out of the hat here?'
@OliGraham1 never judge a man on the quality of his play or beard. Got a lot of twitter mentions, myself included, but it won't sell here.
@david_conn the ages are just as harrowing. Almost exclusively under 40.
@OliGraham1 what I've read has all been nonsense, but quite amusing nonsense
"if God exists, there's no way he's French" - the genius of Andrea Pirlo haha 
@gabicox12 for Christ's sake Gib that notification made me jump!
About to watch Insidious 2 on my tod. If the first one's anything to go by, this is one of my worst ideas
why Mark Clattenburg's Liverpool-Man City display should bring about MAJOR officiating changes 
Pellegrini believes Manchester City's title dream is still alive 
I want what he's having RT “@MailSport: Aaron Ramsey thinks Arsenal are on course for one of their greatest seasons 
Palace will have a huge say in the destination of the Premier League title
@OliGraham1 also I remember there being looooads of talk in the media about 'Shearer never winning the trophy he wanted the most' <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@OliGraham1 don't think many people's will it's more a case of it being bloody impressive if he does lead them to it.
@OliGraham1 you came 2nd both years before those cup finals! (Shearer not at club then miles behind Utd) Liverpool came 7th last year...
@OliGraham1 Shearer never came this close at Newcastle. Gerrard hype's because he's actually on the verge of captaining a side to the title.
Those nerves, Sturridge injury and Henderson suspension. Think Jose will fancy his chances of tearing up the fairytale, if anyone can...
I believe the technical volleyball term for that clearance is a 'spike'
Now then... 
After this game and the 3 pens at OT, how long it will it be until the mock-ups of Clattenberg in a Liverpool shirt start appearing?
Pellegrini's got to do something here. Surely a half-fit Aguero is worth the risk, things can't go much worse and the title's slipping away.
That's why Stirling should start in Brazil. Matured so much this season, brilliant winger
@AlexLanigan I can see why! What a finish
That made my hairs stand up and I'm watching this in SD on a laptop.
@TertiusAlberts not sure about that, hipster! Still so many good boxing fights &amp; I'm not sure grappling on the floor is as good to watch
No byline, but this is mine - honest 
@TertiusAlberts managed to cut MP when he was going for it in R12, showed what he could do when he wasn't just egging MP on. You catch it?
@TertiusAlberts amazing 1st 6, then just an exhibition in combos from MP. TB never gave himself a chance didn't throw enough punches til R12
Redemption. Baffling last 6 from Bradley and he loses his unbeaten record to a guy who walked out to Katy Perry #PacquiaoBradley2
If Pacman stays on his feet one more round surely he won't be robbed again #PacquiaoBradley2

Bradley's ducking reflex is unreal <OK HAND SIGN>#PacquiaoBradley2
Leeeeet's get ready to ruuuuumble! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH> #PacquiaoBradley2
Is Paul Ince actually saying Norwich will be glad to be playing Liverpool? No wonder his managerial career went so well.
@Jonny_Green27 who are we to question the genius of Neil Adams, given his illustrious managerial career?
@TertiusAlberts yeah but he loves the club and will know when to fall on his sword, much to the shareholders disappointment
@TertiusAlberts haha. surely would have been curtains for him too if you'd lost today.
Barca job will again be available in the summer I reckon. Want Atletico to slip up at some point to make that final game unreal.
@TertiusAlberts fair! Bradley's has some luck to stay unbeaten but I think he'll probably just have a bit too much for Pacquiao again
@TertiusAlberts think you might be spot on there. who you backing?
@louiegrant I remember, we are so lacking in depth its crazy. He bangs in another for CP and 3 minutes later we are bringing on... Guly...
to stay up or set an alarm for Pacquiao Bradley, that is the question
@leemyersSfc nah he'd signed a new three-year contract in March, which doesn't exactly suggest 'desperate to go'
Sounds like Sanogo's having a good old-fashioned Regi Blinker.
@leemyersSfc I know that but he was otherwise very happy, Soton-London is not far &amp; how in any case how can you justify that fee?
Can any #saintsfc fans enlighten me as to why selling Jason Puncheon, for £1.5m at that, was ever a good idea?
Right, spent the last three hours battling a haywire laptop at Deepdale, #saintsfc lost to Cardiff and I was one goal off £250. Get me home.
Assistant manager Davie Irons expressed his sincere apologies to the travelling #cufc fans after today's thrashing at #pnefc
FT #pnefc 6 #cufc 1
GOAL #pnefc 6 (Craig Davies 83, hat-trick) #cufc 1
#pnefc's strikers have had a field day. the last four goals have been put into empty nets. Davies the beneficiary again. disaster for #cufc
GOAL #pnefc 5 #cufc 1 (Craig Davies 79)
final #cufc change sees Redmond go off for Lee Miller, while #pnefc bring on Kevin Davies and Josh Brownhill for Beavon and Neil Kilkenny
#cufc sub: Brad Potts goes off, Liam Noble his replacement
this is getting a little embarrassing for #cufc now. Pickford kept out Davies' first effort but he put in the rebound with his thigh #pnefc
GOAL #pnefc 4 (Craig Davies 56) #cufc 1
dear oh dear #cufc have imploded.  Pickford drops a simple cross and Holmes rolls the ball into the net to restore #pnefc's two goal lead.
GOAL #pnefc 3 (Lee Holmes 48) #cufc 1
#cufc kick-off the second half
@AndrewGreaves84 @AndrewGreaves84 well I'll risk the wrath of the Rovers-supporting side of my family and wish you the best of luck!
@AndrewGreaves84 despicable. looks like the champagne might be staying on ice for now!
HT #pnefc 2 #cufc 1
two added minutes #pnefc #cufc
#cufc back in it as Madine heads in his second goal in two games from Danny Redmond's corner. All down to that substitution of course.
GOAL #pnefc 2 #cufc 1 (Gary Madine 41)
#cufc switching things up already. Pascal Chimbonda is replaced by Matty Robson
Joe Garner not playing against his old club today because his wife went into labour late last night... today is his also birthday. eventful.
game over already for #cufc? a mazy run from Holmes is stopped by Pickford but the ball ran to Browne who tapped in his first #pnefc goal
GOAL #pnefc 2 (Alan Browne 20) #cufc 0
stunning save from #cufc keeper Jordan Pickford to stop Gallagher doubling the lead for #pnefc with a curling effort
@AndrewGreaves84 apparently it was one guy who was collared and handed to stewards. Is that not true?
Superb free-kick from Paul Gallagher and Beavon rises to glance in his third of the season! #pnefc #cufc
GOAL #pnefc 1 (Stuart Beavon 10) #cufc 0
#pnefc get us underway!
Nice rendition of YNWA from #cufc fans before the minutes silence
Speaking of subs #pnefc are only able to name six. Garner and Humphrey among the absentees
#cufc have 21 goals among their seven substitutes, compared to just 17 in their starting XI (of which David Amoo has 11)
Team sheets #pnefc #cufc 
#pnefc in no danger of dropping out of the play-offs or gatecrashing the top 2, can #cufc capitalise against a side with little to play for
Off to Deepdale to see if @officialcufc can take move away from the relegation zone with an unlikely win against @pnefc
@Stuart_Clarke1 @AndrewGreaves84 sorry to break it to you mate but they've already given it to this guy 
Can't think of many who have done a better job in sport than Sir Dave Brailsford. What a void he leaves.
@TrevorM90 everyone has their predictions of who WILL win it but I think everyone accepts they CAN win it, unlike Arsenal when they were top
@TrevorM90 I'm not sure there are many doubts about their credentials now!
@Tee_Ntabeni too much time for anyone that forces them to play route one!
Barca you have the power to delay me getting any work done by half an hour, get a shift on!

@PaddyDinham YouTube Karl Power. Hour long documentary, does some mad stuff!
The whole story of the man who invaded the Man U team photo against Bayern in 01 is a very entertaining watch!
@Southampton_ffc what a ridiculous article. There is no rumour to him being a Chelsea fan, he openly admits it and it means very little!
@michaelmufc3 @NealGavyn come on the Kids “@OUFClive: Half time on extra time and it's still #oufc 0 Kidlington 0”
In all seriousness, Ba being third choice is baffling. He's actually scored goals in a major league over the last three years

A fully deserved victory for #buryfc who are now just seven points off the play-offs. #ecfc a mere four points from relegation

a good move down the left ends with Soares bundling it in. done, done, done #buryfc #ecfc

Danny Rose has just fired a good chance across the goal for #Buryfc
#ecfc sub: Aaron Dawson off, David Wheeler on
#buryfc sub: Andrew Tutte goes off to make way for Tom Soares
#ecfc sub: Tom Nichols goes off to be replaced by John O'Flynn
#ecfc down to 10 men! captain Danny Coles had just been booked for one cynical foul and he's just pulled another shirt. game over? #buryfc
Krysiak - the #ecfc hero all afternoon - will be disappointed. Hussey's free-kick squirms through his fingers into the corner. #buryfc lead
GOAL: #buryfc (Chris Hussey 65) 1-0 #ecfc
#buryfc sub: no goal today for Hallam Hope, he's replaced by Danny Rose
#ecfc sub: Matthew Gill off Matt Grimes on
Andrew Tutte is the next #buryfc player to try his luck but he wants again finds Krysiak in the way for #ecfc
another chance for #buryfc this time as a scramble from Chris Hussey's free-kick leads to Chris Sedgwick shooting wide
Hallam Hope has a header cleared off the line but the referees whistle had gone anyway #buryfc #ecfc
2,718 the attendance today, including 144 that have made the long journey up #buryfc #ecfc
#ecfc get the second half going
#ecfc arguably had the best chance through Liam Sercombe as their hosts have made some sloppy errors at the back
#buryfc have been the better team, creating the sort of chances to suggest why they've not lost here since early November but not taken any
HT #buryfc 0-0 #ecfc
one minute added on #buryfc #ecfc
Danny Mayor again cuts inside at is denied by Krysiak! #buryfc really should be in front here
best chance of the match for #ecfc as Pablo Mills' terrible pass allows Oakley to put in Liam Sercombe but he shot straight at Jensen
Danny Mayor skips past a couple of challenges but hits it straight at Krysiak. great chance for #buryfc still 0-0
Tom Nichols skies a free-kick for #ecfc
Nardiello puts one over the top for #buryfc having forced a block from Krysiak just before
Terrible throw out by #buryfc goalie Brian Jensen to Frederic Veseli is intercepted by Elliot Richards but the #ecfc man can't control it
Andrew Tutte's long range shot saved well by Krysiak now, #buryfc have started the brighter
#buryfc captain Craig Jones goes down under the challenge of #ecfc keeper Artur Kryskiak but nothing given by Sebastien Stockbridge
#buryfc get us underway after the teams switch ends pre kick-off #ecfc

Excuse me, what are your views on Dani Osvaldo? I can't figure it out,
@Iwan_Parry no world beater sure, but at 20 certainly a prospect for any lower-PL team. I'd argue he's no worse than Sturridge was at 20.
@Iwan_Parry has pace, good touch and can finish. Been impressed when I've seen him for you and England u21s
Stunned #WBAFC are planning on shipping out Berahino for getting lamped. Any midtable team should want him, the boy can play!
Two good games, two ties nicely poised. Neutrals the only winners on the night.

@OliGraham1 against Mickey Mouse opposition! I can't remember us ever winning at you or Sunderland, plus you probs get to Europe quicker <AIRPLANE>️
@OliGraham1 having seen your team I wasn't going to say anything unless it was a rout but a rout it most certainly was! Long journey factor?
Final thought: I wonder what this man would make of the current situation in the boardroom and in the midfield #lufc 
@OliGraham1 <WAVING HAND SIGN><WAVING HAND SIGN><WAVING HAND SIGN><WAVING HAND SIGN>
BMD stressed importance of Cellino appeal. Asked if he was alone at training ground yesterday re. wages all he said was 'I was there' #lufc
Brian McDermott said the turbulent week was not an excuse for the first-half performance but admitted it made preparations difficult #lufc
Dickov also dedicated the result to the #drfc fans who have travelled far and wide with little joy this season
Paul Dickov says that the win is a big step to safety for #drfc
#drfc only eight points above the drop zone but on this evidence too good to go down
#lufc only improved because they lumped balls into 6ft8" Matt Smith. Worrying times indeed.
#lufc showed far more spirit in the second half but still lacked quality for large periods. #drfc first-half display enough to win.
FT #lufc 1-2 #drfc
that might be it. Smith heads a great chance over for #lufc, the #drfc fans can smell that elusive away win now!
four minutes added on #lufc #drfc
"you're not fit to run our club" comes from the #lufc fans now. some of whom are leaving already.
What a chance for #lufc to equalise! McCormack burst into the box but smashed it wildly over. Had to hit the target. #drfc off the hook.
#drfc sub: Theo Robinson on for Billy Sharp
#lufc huffing and puffing but unable to find an equaliser. Smith's aerial presence becoming increasingly useful. can #drfc hold on?
would have been harsh. angle was so tight, probably not goal scoring opportunity. resulting corner headed wide #lufc #drfc
#drfc keeper Johnstone booked for blatant shirt tug on McCormack, who had beaten him to the ball, in the corner. #lufc fans wanted red
#drfc sub: Richie Wellens coming off to be replaced by Dean Furman
great chance for #drfc with Pearce on the deck again but  it was blasted over by Brown
We've got a game again! Pugh's free-kick headed across goal and who else but #lufc captain talisman McCormack pounces. #drfc looking shaky
GOAL #lufc (Ross McCormack 62) 1-2 #drfc
Tonge has added a degree of composure to the #lufc midfield.
Byram goes into the book for bringing down Sharp #lufc #drfc
music randomly going off gives the #lufc fans something to laugh about but soon groaning again, terrible Mowatt pass ends chance to counter
#lufc have made a double change at half-time, with Aidy White and Michael Tonge replacing Luke Murphy and Rodolph Austin
teams are back out for the second half #lufc to kick-off. can #drfc replicate the 3-0 away win inflicted upon them in December?
#lufc had two chances to pull one back just before the break, but Johnstone scrambled one away &amp; Lees headed wide from the resulting corner
HT #lufc 0-2 #drfc - the boos ring down from the home crowd
a soft goal  for #lufc concede. a simple flick &amp; Sharp turned Jason Pearce, who was left on his backside, and finish. #drfc in dreamland
GOAL #lufc 0-2 #drfc (Billy Sharp 45+1)
"How sh*t must you be, it's only 1-0" is the chant from the #lufc fans. Fairly defeatist attitude, but I can't argue with them so far.
#lufc coming back into this one. Cameron Stewart bends one over from 20 yards. no huge scares for #drfc though.
#drfc Paul Quinn goes into the book for a cynical challenge on Cameron Stewart to halt a dangerous #lufc counter. free-kick hits the wall
#lufc go close! McCormack's free-kick evades everyone and goes inches past Sam Johnstone's left-hand post
Pick that one out! #lufc fail to clear a corner and Cotterill struck it clean and true into the top corner from the edge of box. #drfc lead!
GOAL #lufc 0-1 #drfc (David Cotterill 23)
first effort of the game comes from #lufc midfielder Luke Murphy... its well wide. hard to believe we've played almost a quarter of the game
no huge chances early on, but #dufc have had a lot of possession outside the #lufc box. Donny have also had a penalty shout turned down.
#drfc get us underway!
'Marching on Together' blaring out. Togetherness more apt than ever for #lufc fans
Teams are out. A first #drfc away win since September could leave them 11 points clear of drop zone and surely safe.
That's one change for each team. Cameron Stewart replaces Noël Hunt for #lufc while Lucas Neill makes his #drfc debut in place of Mark Duffy
#drfc: Johnstone, Quinn, Neill, Meite, Husband, Cotterill, Keegan, Wellens, Coppinger, Brown, Sharp
#lufc: Butland, Byram, Pearce, Lees, Pugh, Austin, Murphy, Mowatt, Stewart, McCormack (c), Smith

#trfc and #stfc have both reemerged for the second half, the hosts are about to get us back underway
finely poised going into the second half. #trfc have shown glimpses of brilliance but #stfc look dangerous in the final third.

#trfc sub: James Wallace limps off and is replaced by commentators' nightmare Gboly Ariyibi for his debut
WHAT A SAVE from #stfc Wes Foderingham somwhow keeps out a point blank Jake Cassidysshot that was by no means straight at him
Alex Smith looking a real danger for #stfc should have had a second but only a poor touch spared #trfc
#stfc close to going back in front but Michael Smith can't get his foot on namesake Alex's cross
Ash Taylor inches away from an acrobatic second for #trfc but his overhead kick goes just wide
anything #stfc can do #trfc can do too! Ridehalgh's cross difficult for Power to control but he steered in majestically into the top corner
GOAL #trfc 1(Max Power 15)-1 #stfc
#trfc looking to get back into it imediately but a good move ends with Max Power blazing a shot harmlessly high and wide
#stfc lead and what a goal by Alex Smith. ball bobbling around on the edge of the box and he lashed it in off the bar with his left foot!

Gregory: “I was the proudest man in Sussex on Tuesday night but we took a bit of a punch on the nose today." #ctfc
John Gregory meanwhile said he could have made #ctfc changes before half-time but didn't want to embarrass anybody
Johnson: “I was so pleased for the club about this result because I thought the fans were superb. Everybody felt we needed that win." #oafc
Lee Johnson said his side should have won by more than just one today but was delighted with an #oafc victory
A deserved win for #oafc courtesy of Danny Philliskirk's sixth of the season, although #ctfc made a fist of it in the second half
