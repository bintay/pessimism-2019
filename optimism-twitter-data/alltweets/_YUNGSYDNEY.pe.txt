@TutiWizdom @DiamanteLRivera true. Discussing real issues rather than dumb shit
@TutiWizdom @DiamanteLRivera yeah, I love when you can dispute opinions respectfully rather than gettin rude and shit
@TutiWizdom @DiamanteLRivera that's wxactly how I feel
@TutiWizdom @DiamanteLRivera it's messed up if you're mad far into your pregnancy trying to abort it
@TutiWizdom @DiamanteLRivera You're not supposed to abort a baby after 12 weeks though. 3 months in is usually where they say no
@DiamanteLRivera of course. That's why I don't think u can judge other people for their choices unless you've been where they are YA kno
@DiamanteLRivera I couldn't abort a baby. Even if I was raped I'd still keep it tbh
@DiamanteLRivera It's not the only solution for some.. But for others yeah. I don't like the idea of it but I think it needs to be an option
@DiamanteLRivera rapists literally have the right to have joint custody if their child resulted from rape..... Like .... Come on
@DiamanteLRivera no I feel abortion is ok cause there are some situations where that fetus should not be brought into the world.
@DiamanteLRivera terminated but think of how many fucked up people there'd be if abortion wasn't an option
@DiamanteLRivera it doesn't have feelings, emotions or an established presence in the world. It's a fetus. Its sad that they have to be
It's literally a fetus no ifs ands or buts yo 
I am one mother fucking second away from having a legitimate full fucking blown nervous fucking breakdown that lands me in Bradley see YA

@anaissagrenr but I think it's fuckin shitty because I'm funny and nice to everyone and have dealt wit so much shit at this school and I
@anaissagrenr but it's literally a joke though because I'm not that kind of person

@anaissagrenr I didn't say she didn't and I already said she's the one I'm voting for. But I got taken off cause I have "too many friends"
@anaissagrenr and you obviously know it's not towards Alana so idk why you guys are acting like it is when she's my friend lmfao
@anaissagrenr but they admitted it at the meeting ;/
@anaissagrenr so like that's insulting to who's on there to begin with?

PSA; you don't need to react to every single person that talks shit/says something negative about you. Most of them REALLY aren't with it
@RollllinDubesss true. I also thought he just did that to be on TV. But the interview changed my perspective a lil I think it's sincere
RFTTTTTT 
He's been dressing as a woman his whole life.... No one's admitted it until now  
The "I really just want you to see my nipple piercing" look

@JayleneRinn he ingnant
@JayleneRinn @Tee_Jay222 omg jay just stop answering him <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Lately it really feels like America is taking a step back on the whole civil rights thing and I'm kind of confused as to why??
@MaxRDTheGreat @sassandpolitics what the fuck max? Baby killer smfh
Fiona Goode was a raging bitch and even she didn't tolerate a racist. I know she's a fictional character but STILL, good example bye
@talia2298 yes
Yes, blacks are furious. They are destroying things. Because it's another case where a black is killed and no one will be held accountable
@RashardHinds Lets not
This is like way too fucking accurate lmfaoooooo 
@RashardHinds Yeah but there's no proof God exists. There's proof that black people are oppressed. Slightly different.
Arguing with racists is like talking to a fucking wall bc they're so ignorant it hurts me
@Tee_Jay222 @JayleneRinn Lmfao no bc we weren't enslaved :/
@Tee_Jay222 Yes but when whites get killed for no reason they get justice. Blacks barely ever do.
I'm 100% sure some white people are just in denial of how bad blacks have been and still are oppressed in this country. Like complete denial
@Tee_Jay222 That was in the 90's. It's 2015 and cops are still getting away with the same shit
@Tee_Jay222 Rodney King was stopped for SPEEDING and beaten half to death by 6 cops and they were found not guilty so like stop
@Tee_Jay222 the black guy so he could try to say he stole it ?!!
@Tee_Jay222 Ok did you see the video in South Carolina? where the man did absolutely nothing and then u SAW the cop plant his tazer next to
@Tee_Jay222 It doesn't matter. Today's racism sprouted from slavery all the way in the seventh fucking century. Geez read a book
@Tee_Jay222 LMFAOOOO.... Blacks have been constantly treated like animals throughout it history wtf are u talking about
@Tee_Jay222 that's why there is emphasis on BLACK lives matter because it's fucking 2015 and they don't deserve this bullshit
@Tee_Jay222 white people as a race were never enslaved, oppressed or denied justice on a constant basis.
@Tee_Jay222 @JayleneRinn Ok Ning Ning white lives have ALWAYS mattered though, don't you get that?
@NoelleKelvey yes u do
Are u serious.............. Please say you're not lmfao 
@LexStamatakos exactly because a man will never be in the position of being pregnant w a child they can't take care of lmfao
@LexStamatakos &amp; obviously I don't enjoy the thought of a fetus being killed but women deserve the right to decide what to do w themselves
When u make two people friends and then like neither of them talk to u anymore :///
I'm not spacey at all u lose  
I would rather have never been born than live a life of misery and neglect, wouldn't you?
Like if abortion was illegal 1) women would still get them illegally and get hurt or killed 2) there would be MANY abused/abandoned babies
LMAO:///// UR not allowed to abort a baby once it's developed into a human being rather than a fuckin FETUS 
At Subway ordering my mom's sandwich and my dad just said to the guy "If this is wrong and I take it home I'll get smacked"

Pando fuckin teed giving me a C on that essay saying I didn't analyze in depth. There was literally nothing to analyze lmfao
You deny the civil rights of HUMAN BEINGS because it might upset YOUR personal God that may or may not even fucking exist ???
I just don't get how homosexuality affects ANYONE who isn't homosexual. Like that's not gonna ruin YOUR chance of "heaven"?
Ok like why did the manager of Burger King have me bring him working papers and then not call me back and not speak to me when I call him
Maybe Popeyes will hire me bc they don't have high standards<CONFUSED FACE>

@LexStamatakos yeah it doesn't RLY work that way lol. You deserve to be regarded as a child until you at least graduate high school
@LexStamatakos it's like "mom I need some jeans" "you have an iPhone" "mom I just cracked my head open" "fix it with that iPhone U have"
@LexStamatakos my parents think that because I have an iPhone it's a replacement for their love and support I guess LMAOOO
@LexStamatakos it's like they didn't realize when you have a kid you have to pay for stuff like clothes food and transportation LOL
Not sure why my parents have kids if they were just gonna treat me like I'm a nuisance my whole life lol..

@ForeignGooods I didn't ask u to come here in the first place <WORRIED FACE>
@ForeignGooods not really because I met one of them though so it wasn't for nothing .... So like .... See ya
Can't tell u how many people gave us the dirtiest looks like TF
@ForeignGooods or ur just not funny
People who make fun of someone for wanting to meet an actor or artist they really like &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; #way2go #shittinonpeopleisinfashion
@ForeignGooods when someone doesn't find ur joke funny so ur bitter instead of working on ur material&lt;&lt;&lt;
@ForeignGooods ur acting like we just stood there and didn't walk around and eat and talk to each other, like at least I wasn't in my house?
@ForeignGooods uhm idk if you got the memo but being a cunt is like... Annoying kind of
@ForeignGooods I met Chloe she was nice. And it was fun I met a bunch of ppl
@alanadeIrey UR the girl who cheated and made ur name alanadeirey
@alanadeIrey NO
@alanadeIrey HO DID I ASK
But I did see him in person for like five secs
Actually RLLLY upset I didn't meet Ansel
@LexStamatakos maybe they're in an open relationship though since he's an actor. I guess that could be an option
@LexStamatakos wow rude of him LMFAO
@LexStamatakos they were broken up? Did they get back together?
@LexStamatakos he had a bitch up in there?
Did they really ask how anal rape works?! Like with excessive force how the fuck do you think?? 
@LexStamatakos dammmm I knew he cheated on her lmfao
Fucking grosss 
@LexStamatakos omg whu

@DillasinPickle @anaissagrenr ON MY MOTHA FUCKIN WAY!!!!!!

@anaissagrenr ugh:( maybe not puppies can't fall in love in one hour

@k4ylynn4llie Whateva I'm cool w/ getting a pic with Chloe cause at least I look cute. If I waited for ANSEL I prob would look frost bitten
@k4ylynn4llie maybe he'll see that everyone waited and feel bad haha
@k4ylynn4llie yeah she said it's been a 16 hour day so he's just wiped out
@k4ylynn4llie yeah, idec if he comes out its too cold plus he wasn't coming out till 10:30-11
@k4ylynn4llie I waited for like 3 hours and the dude came out and was like he legit is not taking pictures with anyone tonight
@k4ylynn4llie the cops made everyone leave BC he said he didn't feel like meeting people tonight
@k4ylynn4llie <WORRIED FACE> yo I wanted to meet him real bad no lie
I always procrastinate smoking
@sayiraester "MyIdol"
My parents hate me 
Can't believe prom is in one week
shes basically choosing ur dick over oxygen which i think is romantic as fuck

My parents are rude they don't even care that I met a RLY pretty actress
All I want is a blunt lol
When ur weed man doesn't answer &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; gbye
@DiamanteLRivera yo one time I pulled up to KP and the bus I thought I was gonna have to wait 40 mins for was just about to leave like YAS
@emma_gherardi like it sucks but I understand why he doesn't feel like meeting a bunch of people after working for 16 hours

If u already met Ansel/Chloe why r u here again lmfao and ruining the chances for someone who hasn't met them yet tho......
Chloe is def a bitch <WORRIED FACE>
@k4ylynn4llie no he was just walking across they said he'd be out between 4-6
@bentleylouis_ I'll ask him how he feels about being a step father
I'm crying 
@bentleylouis_ LMFAO ILYYYYYYY
ANSEL JUST WALKED BY AS I DROVE BY EAST OMFG I TEARED UP AND LIKE FLIPPED OUT AND MY DAD WAS LIKE WATS UR PROBLEM
@Loveeandreaxo rather than being like "I'm sorry that happened to you" or something of that nature
@Loveeandreaxo like how ignorant can u be lmfao. I hate that. When u tell someone something shitty and they try to one up you
Bye 
Jokes aren't funny when they're grossly ignorant lmfao
"Jerked off a cow" even though all cows are female and don't have penises  
@Loveeandreaxo and he was like yes it is and I was like wowwwwwww dude kys
@Loveeandreaxo oh no he said "well I was too short to fit on them when I was younger" and I was like that's not the same thing at all....
@Loveeandreaxo my ex bf tried to tell me it wasn't embarrassing that at one point I was so big I couldn't fit on rides at six flags lmfao
I don't get why couples break up KNOWING they will get back together like just work through it
@Loveeandreaxo no really people talk about it like it's as easy as going to the supermarket or something lmfao "like oh just go lose it Hun!
Moms lookin for something to wAtch 
I have 0 prob paying gas $ to someone who went out of their way for me. But if u ask me to come w/ u then ask for $, I'll walk my ass home
It's annoying when u vent to someone about ur struggles as a fat person and they're like "ok lose weight then" THANKS NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT
I need a trim so badddddd
Why am I getting my makeup done for prom at 2:45 tg
@GenGennxo tell that story at my fuckin funeral please

When I had a boyfriend I cried legit everyday and now I'm totally happy... I don't think I'm meant for relationships... Or maybe he sucked
I feel u girl smh 
I'm grounded so my parents are gonna be like where are you and I'm gonna be like "I may or may not be outside East waiting for Ansel Elgort"
@GenGennxo  
Yeah too bad there's this thing called the law and it doesn't work that way at all LOL
