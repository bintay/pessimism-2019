@Tommy_Dexter agree with most there mate. Just can't stand Farage! I keep seeing 'shock result' is tories getting in a shock?!
@Tommy_Dexter you confuse me more and more with your political musings! I can't keep up! What 'hash tag team' are you on now? Green Party? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@T_Thatch9 urgh. It'd be funny if it wasn't for the fact he'll get the job full time and/or we'll go down.
#TheEnfieldHaunting was pretty good. Timothy Spall is a ledge.

@Sandy_Beeson @WilkoWilkes that bloody Wilkes. Yeah. We have been awful. Not been all season &amp; totally lost interest in it all. A real farce
@Sandy_Beeson McHank?! How did you find me old boy?! Hope you're well mate.
@jp_saunders @JosefdePfeiffer U CUNT?
Boateng. MAN DOWN!! Get him a medic. His legs are all tangled <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
What have I just seen <FLUSHED FACE> MESSI
Iniesta's first touch is the result of some kind of black magic. I'm sure of it. It's the only logical explanation.
@annieheilbrunn no mention of the woman beating tonight?! Funny that....
I don't like 'the greatest ever' debates. So hard to compare sportsmen/women across generations. Things change too much.
@Jackwstorey10 <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> I love Scorey. Fully deserved mate. #baller
Heard a rumour @Jackwstorey10 scored two today. My hero.
@UTgehlken hopefully Chris Hairston surprises everyone in training camp. Don't wanna see DJ getting burned by pass rushers all year again.
@KevinGrauel @Chargers I woke up this morning &amp; thought we had re-hired AJ. Hope these players prove me wrong. But hate the picks so far.
We still have no pass rush that will stay off Injured Reserve or is proven. Or a D line to stop the run. Ticket to the Superbowl right there
Great backfield. Draft a corner. Loads of depth options in FA that we ignored at ILB. Draft one in the 2nd. #Chargers #DraftDay
This draft has been a car crash thus far. Looks almost AJ Smith'esque. #DraftDay @BFTB_Chargers @The_KP_Show
@The_KP_Show we are now in a position where we won't stop the run or get to the QB. But it's alright. We have loads of cornerbacks now.
@The_KP_Show reading your TL. I couldn't agree more. I didn't mind TT's first 2 drafts. Hate this one though. Went BPA apparently <FLUSHED FACE>
@markchinery rebuild mode apparently. Why keep picking players out of form or players that have proven to be inconsistent/not good enough.
We traded up to get Gordon as well <FEARFUL FACE><FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR> only have 5 picks &amp; a roster is like swiss cheese. Awful start IMO. #Chargers #DraftDay
Melvin Gordon in the first?! Will give him a chance and I'm sure he'll prove me wrong. But I dislike the pick. #Chargers #DraftDay
If I wake up &amp; we got Gregory, Brown, Dupree or Clemmings. I'll be happy.  Parker/Gurley (Optimistic) if we're going skill. #ChargersDraft
@boltfanindenver @KevinGrauel you were right the first time man. At least in English 'English' you were <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
Oooh. Have some of that. Come on Pacman! 

@Racing_UK @NewmarketRace Blue Bunting, Sky Lantern and Ghanaati
@UTKevinAcee nope. We currently have no pass rush or proven OLB's that can stay healthy. Both lines still need help. Still no no.1 WR.
@jmcullum who does? Not happening. Would love to see him get beat though.
@arunrobinson as a betting man. I agree. Will be odds of about 1/2 though won't it? Pac wins. I'll have 5 pints &amp; not 4. Mad bastard me.
@arunrobinson amazing boxer. Not even the arrogance that annoys me. Although better than the Sugar Rays &amp; Ali? Doubt it.
@arunrobinson I always liked him mate. But the woman beating thing &amp; cherry picking fights more so than almost anyone else fucked me off.
3 antepost tickets for the 2000 Guineas. 3 non-runners. <FLUSHED FACE><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> absolute #mugpunter don't fancy much in this race now.
Made the decision. I am getting the fight. Fuck I hope Pacman destroys him. Gayfeather to win on points is obviously happening though.
The @TheFoxFc win. The @Padres win. This night aint getting any better. <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>

@shaunaaajb I am not having a pop at people that aren't 'skinny' but I caught 5 mins of that show. Those people were unhealthy &amp; truck sized
@shaunaaajb is that what I said? Getting the problem sorted may be a start. Obesity is a huge problem in this country. Do more to combat it
@magentawillow I actually quite like that last analogy <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> fair enough. <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@magentawillow I've no problem with not just pushing size zero models. But why should we be promoting being unhealthy&amp; massively overweight?
@shaunaaajb how do you get that fat without an eating disorder then? It is unhealthy &amp; unnatural. Same as anorexic &amp; bulimic models.
We're a nation of fat lazy fucks. Why should we be encouraging people to be happy with being so fat they may die? What's wrong with size 16?
Plus Sized Model. Erm you mean 'morbidly obese' don't promote eating disorders. Whether that is too much food or too less #PlusSizeWars
@samreed9 we can always share. I'm sure @Kimberly_bell88 is up for it. Variety is the spice of life.
@samreed9 you lost your date bro. My knee is fucked. So looks like I'll be going  on the Sunday. I'm sure you're excited to see me though <EYES>

@markchristie9  
@Chargers @Padres @Summerskilly watch the Padres go this year. Brought in some quality players by the looks of things.
Agree with @Carra23 absolutely pathetic from Krul to congratulate Defoe for the goal. Just another reason why our gutless team are so shit.
What in the war?
No in Benidorm, had a row over a sun lounger! 
@JSeymour8 Audley Fucking Harrison went 19 and 0 for example <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@JSeymour8 they get a lot of fighters up into the high teens with their wins and pad their stats. Then they'll step up for titles etc
@JSeymour8 you can say that for any talented fighter coming up. Check any top boxer's record. Commodity that needs protecting &amp; nurturing.
@BFTB_Chargers enjoyed reading your article on @StevieJohnson13 can't wait for my SD trip this year.
@arunrobinson my man. I knew you'd back me up and confirm what I was thinking <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@leereed10 @LFC <WEARY FACE> you're to blame for Man U winning the league that year <CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@arunrobinson Brook not so much. everyone gives Brook a free pass? I'd like to see the fight. But perhaps Brook should challenge himself 1st
@arunrobinson respect your opinion on boxing. So. Khan/Brook. Love or hate him. Khan has taken on some tricky fights in his career. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Why would anyone want to watch the #itvleadersdebate ? Just a load of crooks lying, mud slinging &amp; changing the subject. Pathetic.
@RichardYates24 If @Kimberly_bell88 doesn't want to go. We can go on a man date Richard. <NAIL POLISH><TWO MEN HOLDING HANDS>
@shawnemerriman shouldn't take a RB in round 1 IMO. Gregory? Yes please! Need help at OLB/DL/OL too. hoping for Ajayi or Duke Johnson in R2.
Just seen the highlights of the #QatarGP  WOW. @ValeYellow46 is the man! #Rossi
How good does #Ultra2015 look? Anyone up for Miami next year?!
@Tommy_Dexter Eastern Europeans in the gym scare me. They always look absolute nails. I reckon you could punch them &amp; they wouldn't flinch
@RForristal_Indo thanks. I did read there was a chance he would retire early as it is hard for him to keep his weight down.
@RForristal_Indo you think J'OB will eventually switch from the flat due to height/weight? Read in the past it's a potential health issue?
@boltschief @The_KP_Show fair enough. Just failing to see the comparison here and trying to get your angle.
@boltschief @The_KP_Show not followed Gregory's career path. But Manziel seemed/seems like a massive delta bravo. Same for Gregory?
@boltschief @The_KP_Show Manziel'y because he smoked some draw? Or is there more supposed issues we should be concerned about?
@annieheilbrunn TY <THUMBS UP SIGN> I have no idea whether or not the Chargers stay in SD. Just trying to stay positive. Won't remain a fan if they leave <CRYING FACE>
@annieheilbrunn good news no? I thought the general consensus was that SD won't get a stadium without help/input from the county?
@MsiDouglas was that him or Stringer? Another great character! The dialogue and accent from Prop Joe was just on another level.

@sdutCanepa glad he would leave if they left for LA. It would make it easier to not follow the Chargers &amp; I refuse to support an LA team.
@NickNRickShep @SkinnyDuzIt @boltschief love Ingram &amp; Jerry. Just one is injury prone &amp; the other still very raw. JJ &amp; Freeney gone too.
@boltschief <THUMBS UP SIGN> not a big college follower. But we need a OLB/pass rusher. As we were horrible last year. Plus a DE to keep Reyes reps down
@boltschief @SkinnyDuzIt zero tech. So a nose tackle that lines up head up on center. I think we need a pass rusher &amp; D end more than a NT
@Special_Mike34 seeing quite a few mock drafts with the chargers taking Gurley at 17. Call me old fashioned. But I would LOVE that.
@RichardYates24 never understand how zombies are so weak &amp; you can cave their heads in easily. But they can rip you apart with their hands?
@DaveWebb8 @TheFoxFc nonces? Look at the clip of ya man. You look like a moomin &amp; you've kidnapped a couple of kids for your profile pic.

Lionel Messi. The best there is. The best there was. The best there ever will be. #hitman
@The_KP_Show thanks for the info mate. On point as always.
@The_KP_Show <THUMBS UP SIGN> Was hoping we took a WR 1st, RB in the 2nd, plus I am sure we still look at linemen early. Need a day 1 starter for pass rush
@The_KP_Show I feel OLB/pass rusher is our biggest need right now. But all the talk is of a WR in free agency.
@The_KP_Show was hoping we'd look to the draft. Feel we'll end up with another old WR. Already have Floyd &amp; Gates who are long in the tooth
Judging by the snapchats from Cheltenham. I think it is time I bit the bullet and went next year.

@The_KP_Show &gt;&gt; we need another WR. Especially if Royal doesn't re-sign. Not sure they're looking at it the same way though. Soon find out.
@The_KP_Show agree about him as a WR. But it is another option. Although we have Pettis in camp for whatever reason &amp; Inman showed flashes&gt;&gt;

The Premier League is not the best league in the world. NUFC are 11th. How is this possible?
Who is this no mark ref? Even before the penalty shout. He has been pub league. Way out his depth.

@jakedrake54 I think I was just tackling that egg of a keeper. They all count <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
@T_Thatch9 i'm sure the advocates of "well there was contact" will disagree. You need sufficient contact to go down. That was a dive.
Football is actually now a non-contact sport. Grazing someone's sock is not a foul surely?!
@happieayala74 England is full of Dallas fans. "Oh we were really good 20-30 years ago. We have 5 rings" etc etc. F*** off. Glad they lost <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@RichardWade I am at a loss here in sunny England? Doesn't maintain possession through hitting the ground. But he has took 2-3 steps?!
@happieayala74 but the Cowboys got here on a lucky call with the flag pick up. That's football.
@happieayala74 have to retain possession when hitting the ground. Just the fact he took steps &amp; then reached makes it a tough call?!
@happieayala74 too many grey areas with the rulebook. But not a catch for me. Said it in real time. Opinions seem divided!
@harry_kenneth quality aint it?! I welled up a couple of times. Didn't cry though. It's no tear jerker like Terminator 2 <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>

@IAmBrighty I think he was a great player. People have him ahead of Shearer, Bergkamp, Henry, Rooney etc in Prem XI's though. Not for me.
@JosefdePfeiffer seen the gorilla before. He doesn't give a fuck! They're all good. Love the dog slapping the cake as well.

Oh and a thug life one for good measure

@JSeymour8 @T_Thatch9 they always have games fairly late. Don't forget they have siesta. Something massively up with them at the min though.
@progambler47 any early views for the 2000/1000 Guineas &amp; the Oaks/Derby? I rarely play ante post. But have a few on so far.

@Tutfoster @toontastic @SackPardew of course it helped. Look at Pardew's attitude and quotes regarding CPFC the last time he was linked.
He gives a goal away and then just sits down and has a drink <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> what an odd man.
Sir Chesney was clearly out on the beers last night <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> Not sure how he is still playing for a decent club. #average
@LeeCarman7 it's just Soldado making him look good. In all seriousness though. He has developed into some player.
@kenboy4 #pulis
@LeeCarman7 he's young &amp; only seen him recently. But this is always what I thought. I'm sure your own fans even mocked him when on loan.
@greg_g_manRH @SkySportsNewsHQ makes a change. Seeing as these polls are usually hijacked by unemployed Liverpool fans.
Sterling throws a punch (albeit a shit one), right next to the lino and the FA are doing nothing? They really are a useless bunch of cunts.

@MikeAshleyLies Carr should be involved.He is scouting all these continental type players. Get a manager to suit. Not a shithouse like Bruce
A player/manager of a Premier League Club? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> you just can't make this shit up. One with an attitude as bad as Coloccini as well.
@lee_ryder I swear a lot of our fans seem happy to settle for mediocrity/shit.
@lee_ryder steady job? BS. He has spent/wasted a lot of money (comparatively) &amp; he has been the definition of average everywhere he's been.
@markchinery @Summerskilly or Steve Bruce. Which would arguably be worse. Most British managers seem to be shit.
@markchinery @Summerskilly Matty King <EYES> Laudrup, De Boer or Benitez. Or some Frenchie. All pipe dreams though. We'll get Sherwood or Kinnear
Not sure what is worse. Palace wanting Pardew as manager. Or the fact they are paying real money for the privilege <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> late xmas present.
@Summerskilly it's the most wonderful time of the year!!! Ecstatic mate. Genuinely just done a little jig around the house.
@NufcVine Derek Wright and Martin Atkinson both looking at him like he's unhinged. He probably is.
@leereed10 oooaaahhh oooo errr it's DrogBAR and it's in. No it's not. He's hit it over and he's offside.
John Motson needs to retire FFS. It's like listening to your Grandad after one too many sherries. I swear he has dementia.

@Special_Mike34 poor ol Matt Ryan is getting the Rivers treatment. Getting smashed back there.
@kfitty1 @BFTB_Chargers usually shutdown in pass coverage. Always reliable in run support. Gets INT's and FF's. Plays every snap on D. ????
@ChargersSDavis and not go for a FG when down 2 touchdowns. <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH><PISTOL> #gutless
@annieheilbrunn @koloco9 no. They waited until the second half to show up (again). At least they played a half. Unlike our O.
@BFTB_Chargers Mike McCoy and Frank Reich have a lot to answer for. That makes no sense whatsoever. Not surprised with them though.
Gouffran starting again. There's a surprise. He really is utter dog's breath. Fuck off back to Palace, Pardew.
@johnnylamotte @ChargersLegion no worries <THUMBS UP SIGN>

@The_KP_Show yep. I know he is durable &amp; has been around a while. But Gilly has never really got it done. Addae is very promising.
@The_KP_Show I like him. Hope he gets more reps. The one play where he knifed 3 blockers &amp; took the ball carrier out was great.Human missile
@arunrobinson "I'm not gonna be wearing the shoes, am I?!"
Markovic's sending off. The game is a joke these days.
@UTkrasovic why waste all that time AND throw away your chance of getting the 1st down &amp; scoring? End result the same. Clueless/gutless.

@MsiDouglas look at the @MikeAshleyLies tweets from this morning. Stats can be misleading, but this just backs up my thoughts on him.
@The_KP_Show yeah fair point. Ravens tried it late in the game on us &amp; it was hit &amp; miss. Butler blitzing may be a better option haha.

Season not over? Gilchrist has been shit this whole game and now that?! Heart attack city here. Massive let off. I'll take it #STLvsSD
@happieayala74 yep poor field position to blame for one score, the pick 6 not them. Only really blown it a few times and on that drive.
@happieayala74 was that him grasping at thin air just now on the TD? Urgh
@happieayala74 can't disagree. Both lines need help and Gilchrist is poor IMO.
@happieayala74 yep. Losing Clary and Hardwick I guess too. That will free up more space on top as well?
@happieayala74 oh yeah. With some help on the D line and Verrett. I am excited for next year. Mathews hurt again? <CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@happieayala74 trying to throw this. Be a miracle if we manage to win.

¬£220 off Noble Mission and the mackems getting annihilated 8-0 has slightly eased the pain of that utter shite performance at football.
@eric_d_williams is that right about Mathews back running on the field? That's good news. Could return after the bye or maybe for Miami.
@harry_kenneth ha. Condemned was like that for me. Scared the bejesus out of me!
@harry_kenneth I'm tempted. But I know I'll be too pussy. Unlike Resi Evil. It is meant to be real hard and you die loads as well!

@happieayala74 haha. Time for bed now! 6am start. These bolts aint good for my health! Haha
@happieayala74 well. Carr made a mistake but what a pick from Verrett! Really happy for him. More injuries/problems. But i'll take that W!!
@happieayala74 a big IF pal the way we've played. Let's go <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
@happieayala74 I think that may have killed us there. Needed the TD.
@happieayala74 our D has been poor all game and now the injuries. I hope you're right!
@happieayala74 Gilchrist awful. No pressure. Flags killing us. More injuries! We're cursed man I swear!

@LeeCarman7 haha. Never been so annoyed to have a winner. 14/1 instead of 40s <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> you and Azza playing tomorrow Leroy?
@LeeCarman7 yeah Kingman is a real shame. Was hoping he'd stay in training as a 4 year old.
@LeeCarman7 AOB always says things like "the best we've had". Impeccable bloodline though. Making sure they get a top stud fee is my guess.
@LeeCarman7 not sure. Beat fair &amp; square in the Irish Champion. Won a mediocre derby, then the joke Irish version. Coolmore hype!
@LeeCarman7 I don't buy the hype with Australia. Retired because he's not as good as they kept saying? I think so.

@poultsyo happy birthday Sir Ian. Whatever gets decided for Saturday. I'm sure it will be a good un!

Yes Ryan. Just fire Tapestry into a place or a win and I'll be happy. #ARCDETRIOMPHE
@UTkrasovic not until they address the running game they're not. I also have my concerns on D. Especially with the injuries. V.good so far.
Yaya Toure is and always will be, my midfield idol. What a player.
@jakedrake54 and players leaving after 4-5 games after a sudden 'change of heart' #timewasters <EYES>
@jakedrake54 nah mate. 2 each and we were dire all round. Turned up all arrogant thinking we'd win and played shite.

@tomwfootball @REALREVSTER the pass to the left back that gets volleyed back inside is delightful. They have a v.good side by all accounts.
@tomwfootball my mate @REALREVSTER 's lad is playing right centre back. Calling for the ball and the switch. Then they do that <FLUSHED FACE>

@leereed10 Taghrooda and Tapestry each way for me.
@kenboy4 in other news. Hamit Altintop looked lively for Galatasaray tonight.
@88mattgreen10 looks good through the middle as a genuine striker.
@ChargersRHenne DB situation not as much of a worry as first thought? Wright's knee better than expected and Verrett back practicing.

@UTgehlken results of Wright's MRI not good &amp; Verrett maybe out for a while longer? More depth at DB needed? Or just paranoid!
@JosefdePfeiffer inspirational. I am looking forward to another Josef special this weekend.
@JosefdePfeiffer hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. 5 in 3.
@jmcullum so do I. Utter shithouse of a manager. Aint happening though.
@RyanMooreFans he has had 100 odd more rides though and is actually going for the title. Unlike Moore. Who is going for big races and ¬£¬£¬£ <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@davearmstrong99 @UTKevinAcee true that. Just not good for more than 2-3 yards sadly. Looks hesitant all the while. O line poor too
@BritishBolts I'm having nightmares against his blown coverage earlier in the game... Still. What a player
@UTgehlken like it couldn't get any worse. Williams already getting carved up. Verrett out. We really need to step up.
@happieayala74 That'll do. We should be playing like that against their poor secondary. Also the worst team in the NFL (bar Oakland<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>)
@happieayala74 don't look prepared. Off the pace all over the field.
@UTgehlken not good enough. We are asleep out there.

@UTKevinAcee gonna gift wrap them the game. Why keep putting it into the D's hand &amp; hoping they'll win it?!
@Chargers @BFlowers24 flat out baller.
@Pistol495 @UTKevinAcee exactly. Until we stop giving teams the momentum on plays like this. We will never be an off season competitor.
@ChargersRHenne  we have blown 2 great chances for TD's and settled for FG's. We should be 21-3 up. Could come back to haunt us.
@UTgehlken not another player injured. Wow
Well. @BFlowers24 is a BALLER. #Chargers #SDvsBUF
Mike Dean. #allaboutme
@happieayala74 not wrong my man. JJ is great. Attaochu healthy to help the pass rush too and Allen is playing at least. Let's go!
@happieayala74 hell yeah. Worried about our game. Ingram is a HUGE loss and sounds like no Allen either. Hopefully wrong though. #boltup
@PhilRacing @tdthurgood don't usually like him but fair criticism of the utterly useless Pardew.
@UTgehlken I hope they bring Law up from the practice squad. Can't imagine there are many good options left in FA?

@UTkrasovic still hit &amp; miss in coverage. But then, most DB's are. Tackling is far better though. That goes for all our 1 on 1 tackling.
@BritishBolts tired!
@UTkrasovic was it Harvin he stopped on the jet sweep cutting inside? His tackling has been solid in both games. Hits 10lbs heavier.

@happieayala74 you know who our coach is right?
@happieayala74 if we can get a long drive going here. Even an FG wouldn't be the end of the world. Hand the ball back and it's game over.
@happieayala74 build a lead? Quick. Hand the momentum right back to the opposition. Too easy. Did it last week as well
Good lord. @AntonioGates85 that is a ridiculous one hander!!!
@happieayala74 @BritishBolts the prevent defense NEVER works for us. Yet we still go with it time and again. Momentum shift.

@UTkrasovic I was impressed with Flowers though and think he is currently put best corner. Potentially a big loss.
@UTkrasovic thanks. I have tried to erase that game from my memory and it was about 4am in the UK. Hope today is better....
@UTkrasovic might be wrong. But wasn't that Wright and lack of deep safety help?

@annieheilbrunn *threw
@annieheilbrunn that we are still negative with our play calling on O &amp; we made a ton of mistakes against a weakened D. Three the game away.
@UTKevinAcee until our HC grows a pair. We're going nowhere. Weddle's decision against MM's wishes got us to the play offs. #conservative
@RomeoS75 @ChargersJBeane exactly this. Took a half to get going. Then when we finally do. We hand the momentum straight back. Terrible
@Chargers don't forget the most conservative play calling in history at 17-12. Deserved the bad snap. We gave them momentum.

@T_Thatch9 one will only go if one comes in according to that bell. So two out and none in then?
Loaned out our only half decent centre back to save 20% on his wages. Getting rid of our only player worth watching. #nufc utter shambles.
Fuck off deadline day. Football is shit.
@UTgehlken so that's two late round picks that aren't on the 53. When you only make 6. It becomes a slight worry. Hope we pick up a DL now.
@MsiDouglas if we get him back then maybe. Can't play with Colo, who is now past it and looks uninterested.
@T_Thatch9 he's shit any way. Just ask @leereed10
@drewery2011 @JosefdePfeiffer he should have joined the City Revolution in 2010. About the same time Drewery did <EYES><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Koscielny forgot his gown. I hope he remembered to scrub up at least.

@leereed10 @LaurenceMaskel1 is Sandro playing though?
@tony_calvin I saw him at my hotel after day one of the Ebor meeting. I didn't dare speak to him. My favourite jockey &amp; clearly the best.
@DBaty81 @FansToonArmy @NUFCThreatLevel so what about the rest of the players? The long free kicks? Krul? Even Anita with pointless dinks.
@DBaty81 @FansToonArmy @NUFCThreatLevel like it's the players doing. The one constant in our awful football is our shit manager.
@RichardYates24 @leereed10 only 8 episodes though and it's the last one <CRYING FACE>
Boardwalk is back on 13th September <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> @leereed10 @RichardYates24
@Finbow88 I'd have him. Our pass rush is shit and we have no depth at DL.
@MODyssey22 @UTKevinAcee I hope so. Our pass rush is terrible and Freeney is old and injury prone. Should have found room.
My shout of 'Diego Costa is gonna be a flop' is looking slightly wide of the mark 3 games into the season.
@T_Thatch9 @SkyBet good odds and deals for the nags. Horrendous football odds!
@SkyBet @T_Thatch9 nice made up PR stunt there!
@Timmy_Lee_G @UTgehlken Law is another weapon for our tame pass rush. I agree with you. Brown didn't really show enough + injury prone.
@darren_Linzoid snap. I just hope we keep doing shit so Pardew has to go.
@MsiDouglas too early to judge the team. Not to early to judge Pardew though. The man is a charlatan.
@T_Thatch9 without doubt mate. I actually hate him. He's nearly on a par with Allardyce and Souness!
If Pardew wants some advice. I'm top of the league and in the semis of the Champions League on my champ man save.
P45DUE. It is hard to have faith in God when this charlatan is still in charge of my club.
@ChronicleNUFC what about his awful management and public speaking?
@leereed10 the argument in the north east is that Cattermole and Rodwell should be in over Colback <FLUSHED FACE> like any are good enough!!
Never been a yellow card that.
Alexis Sanchez's work rate is unreal.
@lee_ryder he gives Cabella pretty much a free role, seems to think Rolando is actually Ronaldo &amp; still persists with Obertan. Yet no HBA?!
@NUFCThreatLevel reminds me of Derby away. Something about pro zone stats and dominating. We lost 1-0 to the worst team in Prem history.
Nevermind Man U's woes. In 3 games no NUFC player has scored a goal &amp; we look toothless. Oh and Pardew is still there.

@T_Thatch9 yeah he does. They are terrible. You should batter them.
@cxvok ... Will be tough. Plus I think Mukhadram is a 10f specialist and hard to reel in. Tele only beat him a head over his optimum trip.
@cxvok I don't think he has the pace for 10f. I agree about a pacemaker as I can't see him winning without. Giving 8lbs to Australia...
@cxvok love to see him win. As I am a massive SMS/Moore fanboy &amp; I backed him the last twice. Just think 10f too short. Australia/Mukhadram!
@RacingPost seems an odd call. Clearly wants 12 furlongs and even then is possibly not Group One class.
@arunrobinson ... Agree with. The human race is littered with inconsiderate, shallow minded mongrels.

@arunrobinson it shouldn't be seen as a negative thing though. However, the likes of the BNP, EDL, Britain First etc give it a bad name.

@NewmarketRace why does your Clerk of Course constantly mislead the public? Saying Good to Firm/Good. Jockeys saying basically soft?!
@JamieBurch11 it's fillies not filly's you phallus.
@leereed10 @vicki_bx @RichardYates24 Windshear or Hartnell?
@vicki_bx @leereed10 @RichardYates24 short prices but Forever Now &amp; Arab Spring, then Insaany at 7/1. Yates has all the winners!!
@tony_calvin can't ignore a horse with Moore up &amp; I rarely do. But did you see High Celebrity's win? Impressive. Not sure what she beat tho?
@vicki_bx @leereed10 @RichardYates24 Hi Boobie Bursford. My nap of the day would be take an Umbrella and keep hold of your dress. #weather
The Germans will smash these Argie bell pieces any way.
Why on earth is Ron Vlaar taking pens?!
Too many touches you diving egg! Now i have to stay up for pens.
Van Persie is about ten yards off the pace. Again.
@kenboy4 where were you staying mate? Gotta love the toon!
I still think Ross McCormack for ¬£11 mil to another Championship side is still the most astonishing football story from today.
My Word!!! #RayWilkins why won't you greedy fuckers let Muller score some more.
Whatever's gone on ere <FLUSHED FACE> Brazil Braaaaazil! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Muller to score a hat trick here and Brazil to win the tournament would be nice. #money

Fuck off you waffle quaffing bunch of weirdos.
Toon actually signed a player and paid money for him? Surely not?
@LeeCarman7 Higuain and Fred.
Ozil. You have just been tackled by President Ahmadinejad, who is also suffering from cramp. Go home you bulbous eyed Shithouse.
@samreed9 one minute into Extra Time <DIZZY FACE>
@samreed9 I blame Ozil. Played with 10 for 90 minutes.

@jakedrake54 hopefully not for another month! Need to get rid of this food baby. AGM Wednesday. Will get decided then I guess.
@shawnemerriman sleeveless tees and tees for training/gym use. I'd certainly have some shipped to the UK!
@tomwfootball NUFC fan &amp; not a huge lover of Sissoko. Especially when played wide. Also think Pogba has been very disappointing in this WC.
@greg_g_manRH gone fishing........
Chiles: So Fabio Cannavaro. He's cut his legs off with an axe in the 6 yard box.

Fabio: No for me is no penalty.
Outrageous finish from Klass! No pressure lad!
@Bigalnash25 your snapchat story <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> like something out of Fear and Loathing. You look about 40 <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> whatever's gone on ere?!
Get in! Think I cheered louder for that then I did for England's goals this tournament.
@JosefdePfeiffer <EYES>
Who is this clown in goal for the Dutch? Terrible. Get Tim Krooool in there. #ianbeale
@C_Reginald_N absolute baller. Shame he lives in a tax haven. Would love him in the prem.
Jamesie. Jamesie Rodriguez. What a bloke.
@Gerrard3_1989 standard Liverpool fan response. Remember this is the third time he's done it, plus the whole Evra debacle. Fully deserved.
@Gerrard3_1989 not really a punishment for internationals only though is it? Lucky it starts now &amp; not nearer the start of the season!
"Moussa Sissoko has about as much finesse as a tazered rat." Probably the best footballing analogy ever.
@T_Thatch9 finishing has been so bad. No idea how Sissoko is still on?! Plays in straight lines and offers nowt.
Paul Pogba is a greedy, overrated shithouse. You cost me 80 quid. I hope you get benched.
France are gonna let me down for the fourth leg of my acca aren't they? Pay me my money!
@Bigalnash25 happy birthday for 8th November big man.

@leereed10 what we need is 442 &amp; a max of 3 foreign players per team in the Premier League. I've heard that every day for the last week <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>

James Rodriguez. Not a bad player!
Giorgio Cannelloni.
@brodobaggins5 you need him though in fairness. Maybe he'll get signed up for The Walking Dead Season 5.
@brodobaggins5 fair play. If Toon were lucky enough to have him. I wouldn't be saying that. I also wouldn't be trying to excuse him though.
The Liverpool brigade out defending Suarez already and making excuses. Wow. Just wow.
What will Hurrion's excuse be for Suarez this time? Flawed genius. #vampire #AnyoneButUruguay
@T_Thatch9 @SkyBet makes a change. Their football odds are usually shit. Thanks for all the money from Royal Ascot though Murdoch <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
Take Fred out my dream team as he is utter horse and he goes and scores. Swine.
That man again. <HORSE RACING><BANKNOTE WITH POUND SIGN>
@LeeCarman7 same but the last as a trixie. Banked plenty. Sharnt bet no more today
@LeeCarman7 I had the forecast and Pether's Moon each way <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> bookie bashing.
Ryan Moore. You delightful small person. #RoyalAscot2014 #TeamTelescope
@LeeCarman7 I'm the worst for that! When Moore is sweet on one, pay attention. As he is usually cautious.
@LeeCarman7 how good is Moore and how good is the horse?! Doing that off top weight is very impressive. Telescope next please!
@UPFCOffical @leereed10 @MissMac90 plus he is on a sex ban. As he needs to keep his game head on and be testosterone charged.
Just the 1st, 2nd and 4th in the Britannia. Today was a good day. #RoyalAscot2014
@LeeCarman7 15 quid each way at 11s with my free bet. Not too shabby. 230 odd better than 50 odd mind!
Estimate. What a filly. Thought I had it there. God bless each way betting. #RoyalAscot #GoldCup
@leereed10 I may have to come to the hart now just to do that!
@jakedrake54 best in the business.
@LeeCarman7 Baitha Alga all day. 8/1 a silly price! Love a drift when it wins!
@jakedrake54 it woulda been if Treve won! Still up though so can't complain. If Cannock Chase wins and Bright Approach wins/places I'm happy
@jakedrake54 snap. Mental price! Plus the deal of money back from Sky bet if the fav wins means I had ¬£15 on at 8s!
Pinched this off Facebook. Great photoshop skills! #Spain #SpainOut #WorldCup2014 
@T_Thatch9 Barca under Tata surely?
Casillas is having a good World Cup. #finished
@T_Thatch9 hi
@patty_levitt errr. Is that even allowed? That sounds highly illegal haha
Looks like Fred has been taking lessons from Papisd Cisse about the offside rule.
@MissMac90 ha. You're worse than the bird. That's all I get every time I back a winner!
@J_Nesta_Brown @Danny_McMoomins phew. I had to double check!
@Danny_McMoomins @J_Nesta_Brown errr. I hope you haven't missed the joke here!
@LeeCarman7 <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
Hootenanny! Wow that was impressive. Good day's gambling.
@LeeCarman7 I am waiting on what happens tomorrow. Frankie wins and I'll only back a few Stoute ones as I always do. Save the profit!
@LeeCarman7 I'm on Lieutenant Miller! No doubt jinxed it. E/w double with Moore's in the last and Hootenany on the nose.
@leereed10 @Evankey2 <EYES>
@CarlingLaurence yeah fuming about Hot Streak still! As that was a double and treble with Kingman and I always back Sole! Treve for 3/3.
Why did Hughes turn the race into a crawl, ending in a sprint. When he knows how good Kingman's turn of foot is? Cheers
@CarlingLaurence oh yes. Trebles and doubles, on the nose and forecast.
Team. Mother fucking Kingman. BOOM
@LeeCarman7 I have the straight forecast with NoT/Kingman and the reverse with a free bet to try &amp; cover my bets a bit! #teamkingman
@jakedrake54 Sole Power just too good. Kicking myself for not backing him. Form is form and he beat Hot Streak at Newmarket.
Cannot believe I have abandoned Sole Power <CRYING FACE>
@LeeCarman7 snap.
@LeeCarman7 considering I backed all 3 (No Hurrion, money back.) I wish I done the tricast!
@LeeCarman7 trebles with Treve and then one with Kingman, Treve and Hot Streak.

@T_Thatch9 @leereed10 smiley faces and croquettes?
@RacingPost why have they been watering? Absolute idiots. Stop producing false ground. Although I am backing Kingman &amp; Hot Streak to be fair
@jakedrake54 no worries. Hot Streak is class. Just hope Spencer doesn't sit 20 lengths off the pace like usual. #frontrunner
@jakedrake54 on one of O'brien's I guess. Probably Guerre as J OB won't be able to do the weight. Worth an each way?
Ryan Moore no longer on Sole Power for the King's Stand? Hughes on instead? Hot Streak it is then. Spencer though <NEUTRAL FACE> #RoyalAscot2014
@Bigalnash25 @bunglebear11 @Summerskilly know how tight he is &amp; how much he loves Arsenal. No way he made a serious shake hands bet on that!
@T_Thatch9 Oscar? Hard to keep track with all these 1950's British names playing for Brazil.
@C_Reginald_N he don't but fuck me he is a horse. The most Anti-Brazillian player I've ever seen lol. Just strolls about.
Safe to say I'll be taking Fred out my dream team at the earliest opportunity. About as mobile as Jon Parkin.

@lee_ryder similar to Sissoko. Natural pass &amp; move &amp; runs off the ball seems to have been drained/coached out of him. Recurring theme
@lee_ryder and score and not concede so many and challenge for silverware and have a manager with balls. Not too much to ask surely?!
@lee_ryder BM have that to be fair. Robben &amp; Ribery were a bit off form and RM got it spot on. I wish NUFC could look after the ball....
@danbazjones @Swannyg66 @BurwellCC Toon legend!
@lee_ryder agreed. I like to see battles like last night though. Pacey counter attacking vs pure possession football.

The PDA monster was out again last night. Outrageous scenes. <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>


@T_Thatch9 and they're both still shit. #gethimontheplane
@mickquinn1089 Should have gone at the end of last season. Mini run of form earlier in the season aside. We've been terrible for a while.
@nickjeffers_no1 @ashfuller29 @MilitaryPorn saw one of them at Miramar. They are impressive!
Haha. @PardewVines is superb. #pardewblamebingo


@St1pe I have pretty much been ignoring everything in the press now. Bong eye Ryder has gone into overdrive &amp; so much drivel.
@St1pe keep getting hammered and fall out of the top ten. Means the useless fuck doesn't get his bonus at least. He aint going mind.
@Kimberly_bell88 @humes88 switches <FLUSHED FACE>
@harry_kenneth awesome aint it? Second is about ten times as good. Story is actually good too believe it or not.

#nufc 
@RichardYates24 just got better. sunderland going down is the only thing I have to look forward to this season &amp; that looks doubtful now!
@T_Thatch9 the Argie anti-football manager. Probably calls Allardyce and Pulis for advice.
Even if Barca win. I can't see jacket tata Martino staying. Barca look weak &amp; clueless a lot. Teams don't fear them. He's lost the players.
@humes88 would be 8 or later pal. Can do it Friday at some point or talk you through it if you're feeling brave. Haha
@humes88 what time should I come over? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@humes88 that looks like you have the earth with the neutral and the live with the neutrals and switch wires!

@JordanHaynes7 cheers pal. If you could get a consistent settled team. You'd be right up there too.
@JordanHaynes7 you made 4 important saves pal. Hopefully next time we play you it's in a pre season friendly. Hope to go up. You never know!
@JordanHaynes7 a win?! Haha. Joking. Thought your guys that stepped in did well. I reckon you're better in goal! Some top saves lad.
@Bigalnash25 your near side brake light is out mate. #housemusic
@king_jamest That's what I mean about ground. Declared I'd take evens. Australia all hype so far. Craven may change my mind but I doubt it
@harry_kenneth well worth a watch. Martial arts with some shooting for good measure. Brutal scenes!!
@king_jamest I just spoke to one of the ground staff. It will be riding quick &amp; genuine GF ground. I'd be all over evens of he turns up!
@harry_kenneth you seen the first? Well worth a watch. The fact it's subtitled somehow makes it better.
@LaurenceMaskel1 yeah. Was just like a breeze up. Yet to see him get a proper crack of the whip. Cruise
#TheRaid2 Holy Fuck that was ridiculously good. <THUMBS UP SIGN>
Just watched Kingman win the Greenham. Wow. There's your #2000Guineas winner!
‚Äú@drewery2011: Robbed‚Äù

Sarcasm surely?! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Some game that!! I like Pelligrini. He may look like a Spitting Image doll. But he seems to have a bit of class about him.
@JosefdePfeiffer haha get out! Twisted &amp; turned. Sat the defender &amp; keeper down, then slotted it home. The Joey of last week. Not yesterday!
That was a typical @JosefdePfeiffer finish there. What a goal Sterling.
@brodobaggins5 @jakedrake54 @markchinery my man!
@markchinery head up boy. Tough game. Win is a win! Team effort. #cliches
@Summerskilly well in Summy. It was quite amusing seeing you get hacked every 5 minutes. Top performance mate.
@LeeCarman7 don't be bitter Leroy my chum. It doesn't suit ya!
As if big @shawnemerriman is now in the WWE! Small bloke <FLUSHED FACE> #lightsout 
Mertesacker. What the devil?! <FLUSHED FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@LeeCarman7 imagine even!!
@LeeCarman7 I feel sorry for the treadmills and benches. Imaging the stress they will be under.
Badflop: Yeh, definitely mate *pats stomach*
@MsiDouglas to be honest. The media have been really lenient. Plenty of fans have been saying they want him gone since end of last season.
@LaurenceMaskel1 straight forecast on Kingman &amp; Night of Thunder. A small double with Top Diktat &amp; J Wonder. Kingman wins the 2000 surely?
Swifts won. ¬£100 on the nags. Having an Indian tonight. #lifeisgood
@ChargersJBeane haha. No worries man. Next time I am in America's Finest City. I'll buy you won. Have fun in England.
@UTKevinAcee hey great article. If I lived in SD (I plan to one day) I would accept a moderate tax hike. Like you say though, not needed.
@Bigalnash25 big baller! Agree with both to be honest!
@JosefdePfeiffer wow. Looks like I was right to worry. If you need rescuing. Just send up the bat signal and I'll be there.
@ChargersJBeane why an earth are you coming to sunny England? If you're anywhere near Newmarket. I will buy you a beer!!

@JosefdePfeiffer well. I have to say I am worried. Will you make an appearance tomorrow. That is the question?!
@MsiDouglas But those heavy defeats have not dented Mike Ashley‚Äôs belief in Pardew as the man to turn it around" What about last season Mike
@kbadflop @kenboy4 
@markchinery they have looked awful (by Barca standards) all season under Martino. Not even enjoyable to watch any more.
@samreed9 I was worried this was a start to one of @Bigalnash25 's motivational gym tweets! It's not. Sorry I doubted you man.
Pleased for Demba Ba. He should get more chances for #Chelsea #ChelseaPSG
@jasonparker06 yep. The fact that we didn't speaks volumes. As long as fans turn up &amp; we stay up. He stays! Not looking good for Soham mate?
@jasonparker06 clueless fuck needs to go!!

Guess which manager got the sack? (From #nufc .com) #ncfc
@JosefdePfeiffer legend versus roidfaced gimp.
@danbazjones you tomorrow then?!
I say it pretty much every week. But #TrueDetective is the shit. Ridiculously good TV!
@JonnyBarton look up his one from Saturday against Villa. Foreigners are killing our game <WEARY FACE>
@poultsyo @markchristie9 I just texted Mark this. It's his ante post banker. He said she can't lose <EYES>
@greg_g_manRH I'm sure there will be words. In the mean time. Burwell United FC has a nice ring to it <EYES>
@UPFCOffical I didn't get my usual whatsapp from @leereed10 to confirm and I had family commitments. Apologies. It won't happen again!
@LaurenceMaskel1 @JonnyBarton do you mean Joseph and not Jonny?!
@milesstarforth always about energy and fight with him. I think it's usually us being out thought, not out fought. He is clueless tactically
@Keenan13Allen what do you think of my home screen pic from across the pond? #whiff 
@C_Reginald_N send us the recipe please mate! Love stuff like that.
Was that Hales lad playing baseball earlier? Wow. #hits
@MsiDouglas how any sane fan can still back Pardew is beyond me. Owner doesn't help, but he's as clueless as they come. Dire to watch.
@darren_Linzoid I still love Leon Best. I'd have him at toon ahead of the so called 'strikers' that we own.
@CaulkinTheTimes our tactics seem to be. Keep it tight, create nowt, hope the oppo don't score. Then rely on a bit of late drama/magic. Urgh
In other news. Manchester United <FLUSHED FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Big call. But I don't think I will ever go to watch NUFC again whilst Pardew is in  charge. Hope we lose. #flatheadnige #headsgone
@MsiDouglas start with the utterly useless and inept coaching staff. Bunch of clueless dinosaurs in charge of some talented players.
@JosefdePfeiffer haha. I will jut watch and admire your adonis like body.
@JosefdePfeiffer hi <WAVING HAND SIGN>
@T_Thatch9 you were terrible. Distinct lack of backward through balls and not enough overly optimistic shots from range.
@davidmilnesHQ cheers. Do you know of any planned targets for him yet? Seems like another typical Stoute 4 year old that will improve.
@davidmilnesHQ still working well I take it then David?
If @leereed10 had a bird come watch him play more often. He'd probably be a Premier League footballer. #nonleaguerivaldo

@Kimberly_bell88
Gonna go and watch my @UPFCOffical mates win their big top of the table clash tonight. They'll conquer the world soon. #number1fan
@denise_barry besr show on TV. Can't get enough of it.
@jakedrake54 check your stats! Think it was 13 reds in the last 14 Clasicos. 19 career reds for Ramos though! #stato
I can put up with the diving and shit refereeing. When La Liga is good, there is nothing better for me. #ElClasico
@Summerskilly you did once I believe!! Snap.
@T_Thatch9 May be proven wrong. But I think he will still be world class when his physical attributes go. Don't think the same for Ronaldo.
@LeeCarman7 nah. I meant Pepe is worse than Barton. I think he is my most hated player!
@LeeCarman7 @Joey7Barton no chance there Leroy. Oh and it is you're <COOKING>
@GAZZYBURWELL err. I lasted as many minutes as you had Guiness mate haha. Need you back playing.
@markchinery @GAZZYBURWELL I always love the La Liga montage of players looking depressed. #emotioncam
@GAZZYBURWELL probably sweating the rest of your Guiness out from Friday. Heard about your antics! Has your leg fell off yet pal?!
Are they trying to find a camera angle where Neymar doesn't look wank?
What's with the #ElClasico FIFA96 camera angle? #megadrive
@jakedrake54 @T_Thatch9 won 4-1 mate.
@T_Thatch9 sharnt have no more. Up she go.
@Summerskilly my man. Been on for weeks. Shame you're now sacking us off for gay bat <CRYING FACE>
@kbadflop wait!
My shout for Liverpool winning the league is looking less and less silly each week. Team that gets hot at the right time wins it.
Good impression of Steven Gerrard today. The one where he played a through ball to Henry <FLUSHED FACE> in other news ¬£122.66 off my acca. #bullets
Arsenal and Forest have started well.
@T_Thatch9 ahem. Remy salute you mean?!
@T_Thatch9 pah. I am gonna allow for the wind and hope one flies in.
@T_Thatch9 yeah. Home to Chatteris buh.
@T_Thatch9 come and support the team where you belong. #thatchiscominghome
@JosefdePfeiffer I'm living the dhansak dream tonight. I might keep the receipt and get you to reimburse the funds after you bag 3 tomorrow.
First bet on the horses of the year. Winner. All downhill from here.
@StewartWood @MsiDouglas surely this isn't real?!!!
@JosefdePfeiffer nevermind that. What about your no show at training? I'm devastated. Pet Broon was there in tremendous form!
@J_Nesta_Brown @drewery2011 @JosefdePfeiffer be fair. Drewery was a die hard citeh fan when Dickov was banging goals in in div 2 <EYES><FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>

Not having the 'Fergie is to blame' shite. It's a cop out. They still have a lot of talent. Moyes is just an uninspiring, clueless gargoyle
@T_Thatch9 nice. I think your day with the plastic mancs will be enjoyable tomorrow!
The walrus in the geps giving Coutinho shit on that corner. Wow. You're a troll and your team are being dry bummed at home <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> oh 3-0!
No contact and a dive for me. Still. LOOOOLLL.
@T_Thatch9 your phone still rings. I called it earlier forgetting you'd lost it.
@ObafemiWilliams @darren_Linzoid @kenboy4 Hurrion in goal. Haha. Watch the bounce Si. Remember that? #frick
@darren_Linzoid @ObafemiWilliams @kenboy4 haha that is superb!
@LeeCarman7 @Summerskilly get help. #addict
Someone just let off a 'bucken crow scarer at White Hart Lane!
I wonder if Sherwood will still big himself up and ask for more respect after this game? Or will he blame the players again? #schooled
Soldado looks like a mafia hitman. Superb gel backy. Tim Sherwood is what @wags_1 will look like in 20 years.
After this game. I am sure England's Cricket team will be investigated for attempted match fixing. Trying to find new ways to lose.
@kenboy4 ha. I was surprised at how much healthy shit you had. I bought some maoams, a galaxy, engine oil and washer fluid. #foodofchampions
Good to see my ol mate @kenboy4 earlier. Lovely bloke. #bloodygoodrep
So for the second time this week. I have decided against backing a JP McManus/Barry Geraghty combo. 10/1 and 8/1 winners. #mugpunter
I fancy Zarkandar e/w and More of That for the #WorldHurdle no idea why?! #CheltenhamFestival
This ref is turbo shit. Go back to school you clown.
@NUFC why is he still employed?
I wonder how much the boys have lost at Cheltenham so far?!
@DanLloyd93 :( I used to pride myself on not being injury prone. Hoping it is just a slight pull TBH. Think it is as well.
@DanLloyd93 better than a fucked hamstring. #prayforhullshammy
@Summerskilly you went on a beautiful Messi esque run. But you bottled the finish! Gotta get you a goal Summy!
@UPFCOffical also a case of severe head loss as I didn't pass to him one time &amp; went for an overly ambitious run instead. #scalded
@markchinery I have never had a hammy problem. Fuming. It will affect my lightning fast speed in my later years <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
I've been struck down by the Carman brothers hamstring curse!
#TrueDetective may have already overtaken Boardwalk Empire and The Sopranos. That show is serious.

@LaurenceMaskel1 looked fucking rank. But he's been played all over in fairness.

@MissMac90 I'll think about it.... <EYES>
@T_Thatch9 don't know mate. Think there are different versions of this new magista range and one is replacing the CTR.
@T_Thatch9 awful. They're stopping the CTR's as well. Finally found a boot I am pretty happy with and they pull em!
@UTgehlken I liked him as our nickel back. Seems as if we are going hard for a corner in the 1st round. Needs to be a readymade starter.
@harry_kenneth @JeremyClarkson @piersmorgan @sportrelief in a ring of fire, full of deadly snakes, scorpions &amp; komodo dragons. Both cunts
@T_Thatch9 6-7 more years with this chump in charge.

Riverpool to win the league. Rodgers manager of the season. Suarez player of the season. Might see what odds for the treble.

@LaurenceMaskel1 @RichardYates24 @T_Thatch9 have stopped trying to rationalise when it comes to him mate. Not got a clue. Well played lads <THUMBS UP SIGN>
0-4 <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> &amp; Pardew will still be there in the morning. Sorry @poultsyo we can't go to the Villa game now. I gave my tickets to some blind kids.
@RichardYates24 @T_Thatch9 @LaurenceMaskel1 sounds like it. Especially the 1st one. We'll sell him if he plays too well!!
@St1pe @kyeeee_ the media seem to always stick up for him. Local press starting to stick the knife in a bit. But only because of the ban.
@T_Thatch9 @RichardYates24 @LaurenceMaskel1 all I've read is you've not had to get out of 2nd gear &amp; still battering us <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@kyeeee_ Newcastle United. The club that rewards failure.
@RichardYates24 @T_Thatch9 @LaurenceMaskel1 I'm glad I didn't have that 2-0 bet. I would have been fuming!
@St1pe why has he done this? Such a dick lol.
@Geordie_Nick @CaulkinTheTimes what this man said. Spot on. You've got it the wrong way round Pards you fraud.
@leereed10 ah it makes sense now. He still owes me 100 quid the little sod.
@leereed10 go on? In the words of Sir Les Red himself. I've lost my head!
@milesstarforth another to leave. Let the re-building commence. I look forward to signing Jon Walters, Shawcross &amp; Mark Noble.
@St1pe perfect chance to try and win a midfield battle. They're playing some solid players in there too. Not wor Pards. I actually hate him
I'v finally lost it. In the words of #flatheadnige I hope we lose tonight. Fuck off Pardew. You totally inept, hair lipped thundercunt.
@RichardYates24 @T_Thatch9 @LaurenceMaskel1 we have to score first. Been doing well to get nil lately!!
@LaurenceMaskel1 @RichardYates24 @T_Thatch9 predictions my chicken loving chums? I will go for 0-2. Derek Adebanjo 1st scorer.

@Joey7Barton it was a good battle and fairly even. Took it in turns winning their duels. Certainly wouldn't say he is quicker?
At least we haven't got Chelsea next. 10-0
@darren_Linzoid he's injured aint he? He looks to be playing centre mid to me. Why when they have Milner and Rodwell I don't know.
@darren_Linzoid is he playing midfield? Not surprised. Barely mobile enough to play centre half.
Matic trying to outmuscle Yaya Toure <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> get off me child. #weights
@LeeCarman7 It's like the Grand National &amp; The Ashes. Loads that don't like/understand it are suddenly die hard experts &amp; fans! #tradition
@tomwillz10 @TSBible I'd do the same!!
Anthony Joshua <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> impressive performance. Small fella!! Future star hopefully.
@JosefdePfeiffer @GAZZYBURWELL just battered pride. The legs will heal in time for next week. I will feast on the souls of their players.
@kyeeee_ changed your pic I see. Good lad.
@JosefdePfeiffer @GAZZYBURWELL no drinking allowed until we smash them next week.
@St1pe not surprised. Our game was much the same mate. Just sat with the cat now debating what to do with my life. I hate football!
@St1pe didn't watch it luckily. Oh &amp; we lost as well. If I get done for any crime tonight. It's not my fault. Football made me do it
@jakedrake54 Ghostface and Meth are just ridiculous. RIP Ol Dirty you nutty crackhead.
@J_Nesta_Brown I am Director of Football. No trial needed. I am readying a bid. Going to table an offer of a table full of Stella.
@St1pe good job we signed someone really. Oh wait... MYM centre mid. You watch.
@J_Nesta_Brown playing at Bottisham pal. Against Fulbourn sports. When you signing up?
Wu Tang - 36 Chambers is my pre football playlist today. #Tunes
@jasonparker06 never get nervous for the derby. But Pardew the bottler has given them hope &amp; they no longer fear SJP.
@St1pe they have looked vulnerable when I've seen them &amp; were awful second half against Stoke by all accounts. We won't go for the kill tho
@St1pe can't see the system working with Shola. The interchanging, pace &amp; movement was actually good Tuesday. Expect AP back in his shell.
@St1pe he needs to score. I have got a quarter final today so won't know the score whilst playing. #tense
Had a dream we started with Williamson &amp; Shola up top in the derby. I know Pards likes hoof ball. But surely even he wouldn't do that? #nufc
@kyeeee_ change your profile pic man :(
@CaulkinTheTimes I like how one person answered seriously in amongst the sea of abuse. They don't help themselves.
@Summerskilly I'm there pal. If only to see the scalded cat summerskill. @GAZZYBURWELL better stay sober. Not carrying him for 90 tomorrow
@jakedrake54 haha what a weapon. Poor ol boy aint right in the head.
@Summerskilly you said the best player had been dropped. I assumed you meant Bopara <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> you at the Legionnaires Disease bar later?
@Summerskilly Bopara has been dropped?
Deadline day and I'm in London. I'm going to miss all the deals #nufc pull off.
@lee_ryder hahahahahahaha. Course they are.
@lee_ryder pointless. FA rarely overturn these things. Should show Shelvey's butt on Debuchy that went unpunished though. #doublestandards
11-1 over 2 games <FLUSHED FACE>
Rav the Chav was on fire today. I always said he was World Class. #sirravinderbopara
Sunderland vs Stoke tonight in the Premier League. Live pictures from the Stadium of Light. #mongs 
@T_Thatch9 always looks a bit chubby to me?
@T_Thatch9 I'd take him as a Cabaye replacement. All these fake bids for players who are too good for us are a bit irritating.
@leereed10 looks like you're set to splash the cash then. John Henry has opened the transfer war chest. #transferwindowsayings
I seem to remember that CunningPlonker fellow looking awesome for Ukraine in the Euros &amp; against us. Good deal for Liverpewl.
I thought that @Bradley4Johnson bloke was in Coronation Street. He's certainly a good actor. Looked out of place on a football pitch mind.
@tieguydesign @annieheilbrunn haha. I am English and this certainly isn't true. I love SD. It's like my second home now.
Home from a disaster zone 0-0. Could be worse. Could be an Everton fan <FLUSHED FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Scottwilsonecho Should have had a contingency plan in place long ago. But MA won't spend so we've ignored the situation. Pathetic really.
@Summerskilly we won't replace him though. Or it will be with someone a lot cheaper. Kinnear said nobody is leaving. So no dramas <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Summerskilly on the cards since summer. Never matched his ambition. He deserves a club that challenge for &amp; win things.Was our best player
@brodobaggins5 @harry_kenneth not great if you have duck feet like me! I find em too narrow.
@markchinery seen them pal. Nightmare to get in studs &amp; cost like 140 smackers! The all black ones were the best too. Had 3 pairs.
@patty_levitt I'd love another pair of all black Nike Tiempo's. But finding a pair of boots in 11 that aren't orange is proving difficult.
@MsiDouglas I would say ¬£25m. Not worth that much. But over-inflated market, time of year &amp; MA being a good businessman are all factors
How hard is it to find a decent pair of football boots these days? Unless you want a pair that look like a fluoro tartan UFO. You're fucked
@harry_kenneth you've become very angry in your old age! You almost make me seem calm. Ok maybe not haha.
@kyeeee_ all about Harrelson. What a guy!!
@JosefdePfeiffer cheers bro. You too. Chippy man must have heard about the game as he threw a free large cod and chips into the bargain haha
First takeaway of the year. Treating myself to a chicken kebab. I've earned it today. #sweater
@samreed9 I thought you was a tree at first. Like it. Rascal indeed.
@hayesvip @MiniKitson @GregoryLaird @SkySportsNFL Rivers.
@SkySportsNFL 
@SkySportsNFL Keenan Allen hurdle and push into the end zone vs the Broncos. Quite a few of Josh Gordon's as well!
@T_Thatch9 @8Fact_Footballl granted he is pretty bloody good when he decides he wants to play and earn more money and/or a new contract.
@8Fact_Footballl @T_Thatch9 and?
Am I the only one who hasn't heard the words "gruffers" and 'lallies" before? They mean pants and tits apparently. #fenlife
@GAZZYBURWELL thought you gave them the tie mate. Moyes and his negative tactics cost you last night I thought. Never went for the kill.
@ColeAWhite @Scottwilsonecho ok so his top 4 point may be wrong (moot point they will finish top 4) therefore the runners up get nowt.
@ColeAWhite @Scottwilsonecho read it again. That's what he said.
Worth the trip last night @GAZZYBURWELL ??? Training was much better than your game. This is what it's like to support a struggling team!
"They've gotta knuckle down they've got a tough game coming up at the weekend." Kevin Phillips there on Sunderland vs Kidderminster Harriers
@T_Thatch9 ssshhh. They can fuck right off!! Think he is gone though. Hope we can keep him til the summer.
Quite a lot of fans and stewards must be heading to A&amp;E after that shootout. #BOMBARDMENT
If Phil Jones is taking pens. You are always gonna struggle!
Good pens here <FLUSHED FACE>
De Gea to make up for it and be the hero?! Nah. Convinced the mackems have done a deal with the devil and will go through.
Lee Cattermole Short Watch. Nipple chafers.
@LeeCarman7 sexual predator. Have you seen this man? Goes by the name of Leroy Brown.
@NicolaMarie23 he hasn't aged in about 20 years. Defo a vampire or something. Cool guy.
@RichardYates24 @ObafemiWilliams amazing backheel goal? The title is misleading.
@DanLloyd93 I don't know bout you but I'm having a ball!!
@harry_kenneth DK MODE!!! Oddjob with the double bazookas. Just crouch down and slide about the map without getting killed. #bestgame
@UTKevinAcee interesting interview/article from a while back. What a waste! 
I wonder if Mirallas and Baines will get as much shit as Suarez? Both with good dying swan impressions tonight.
@samreed9 extract from your upcoming autobiography? Sam Reed: Plenty of Beers, Plenty of Goals, Plenty of Fish.
@ashfuller29 it's a hilarious fen bumpkin voice. I imagine the novelty wears off if you have to work with him everyday!!
@poultsyo so here's to you Mike Braziliamson. Geordies love you more than you will know. 


@markchinery all I know about snooker is what Northern Rich once told me in the legion. 'It it where light shine ont ball. Sound advice.
@arunrobinson I have never seen someone slung out before. Need to make it like the darts. Chucking beers about, chanting &amp; tits.
It's all kicking off in the snooker. "Finish him off Ronnie. He's a mug." #scenes
Ronnie O'Sullivan is pretty decent at hitting balls around a green table. What a player.
@St1pe haha. What a dick that guy is.
No.24 for Swansea is awful. Not even sure what his name is, as he hasn't held onto the ball long enough for the commentator to call it.
@patty_levitt he'll return to his usual self next season &amp; the daggers will be out. He's been like it at every English club. Frustrating.
Adebayor in the middle of his customary half a season of being a footballer I see.
Solskjaer has the strangest accent ever. Norwegian Manc?!
I no longer watch wrestling. But the Royal Rumble is worth a watch. It's like the FA Cup, The Ashes &amp; The Superbowl. A real sporting event!
@JosefdePfeiffer I knew your shout earlier of 'I'm not drinking at the moment' was complete and utter bollocks!!!
@jackalous_ison Cabaye. #baller
@Summerskilly @samreed9 you pair need counselling.
@jakedrake54 haha. Cheers pal. I'm sure someone will have a spare pair. There will probably be some pikey in Manea wearing mine as I type.
@Summerskilly @samreed9 what?! How does that even happen?! Left mine at 'buckin Manea buh.
Anyone got any shin pads?! Oops.
#12YearsASlave <CRYING FACE> if you're easily moved or suffer from depression. This aint the film for you. Amazing.
@patty_levitt ah. Should have read this first!
@patty_levitt what? A lot of them are just amateur sports that nobody actually cares about &amp; it's GBR. Not shit. Underachievers &amp; bottlers!
@LeeCarman7 liverpool fans disagree!!
I'm a big fan of Otters.
Does anyone care for Aston Villa? I'm not even sure Villa fans like Villa. #shitclub #shitfans #shithole
@CarlingLaurence correct. Favourite England player for sure. Shame he has so many tantrums &amp; spends half the game crying on the deck though.
@GAZZYBURWELL they are quite different though. So it's what you prefer really. Oh &amp; there might be Man U bias lol. Gravesen my fav baldy.
@GAZZYBURWELL not for me Jeff. Stats back up what my eyes tell me. But yeah. Both out of this world. I'd take Philipe Albert over both.
If Jack Wilshere wasn't such an irritating, whinging little bell end. I do feel people would appreciate his footballing talents a lot more.
@GAZZYBURWELL strange they had to extend voting when Ronaldo went on his hot streak &amp; Messi was injured. The little man needed a year off.
#BoardwalkEmpire <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> really is one of the greatest shows ever made. Shame next year will be the last season!
@kbadflop runs his arse off. No longer great at taking the full back on and his crossing aint great. A workhorse really.
Get replies to a controversial tweet. Don't know enough about the subject to debate reasonably. Claim you've got a bite. Welcome to Twitter.
@UTKevinAcee funny how it's flipped round from early season. Now our D look solid enough. Our O is faltering.
Just had a flashback of 
@LeeCarman7 's penalty from yesterday. Good Lord. #thunderbastard
@BritishBolts early night at this rate!
@T_Thatch9 @ObafemiWilliams KING SHIT.
@UTkrasovic got good pressure up the middle last week. I know they were a bit banged up. But Cinci's O Line aint exactly shabby.
@michelleburch16 @samreed9 @AndyTCarroll he has previous. Football excites him. 
@kyeeee_ drug ballad?
@MalfuriousP @Rob3rtwhitt @NUFCThreatLevel for Milner coming on as sub I thought? If not. Shame on them.
Another former Anfield favourite.... CHARLIE ADAM. What is Alan Parry on?! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@milesstarforth if he took his spitting image mask off. He might have been able to see the incident clearly. #clueless
@St1pe seems the easy option. Doesn't seem like he has a big ego. Not a well known name. Oh we'll sub him off regardless of how he's playing
It all went to shit when we took P Diddy off. Never keep the ball without Big Vurn. Just resort to lumping it forward.
Oh and I didn't know you can decide it's offside a minute after the event and without flagging. Often see goals like that &amp; they stand.
The offside rule is bullshit. I would say if you're six yards out. You're interfering. But he doesn't move for the ball or impede Hart?!
@kyeeee_ did he flag afterwards? Didn't flag straight after did he? Didn't think you could have a 30 second think &amp; then decide TBH!
@YouveBeenHodged @RichmansMS17 haha. Looks like Pete Carroll!
@Summerskilly @bunglebear11 right arm backwards.
@vannacee I think Reich would probably step up. Rivers speaks highly of him &amp; I would imagine McCoy has a big say on our O plan anyway.
The football we played under that bloated shithouse was some of the worst I've ever seen. Makes Pardew seem like Guardiola.
Fat Sam the fraud looking like the Grim Reaper there in his coat. Quite apt really. #deadmanwalking
Allardyce <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@vannacee @annieheilbrunn we certainly do. Need him for at least limited snaps. Very impressed with Ohrnberger though. Way to step up!!
.@leereed10 is on top form tonight <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> never knew you had this in your locker. Oh &amp; what kind of shit team losses to sunderland?.....
@ChargersRHenne when will it be up Ricky? Probably the middle of the night for me. Will have to check it out tomorrow morning.
@ChargersRHenne @DjFluker76 "oh how I've wasted my life. God have mercy on my soul."
@Tommy_Dexter you've just reminded me how shit that song is. Had pretty much erased it from my memory! So overplayed at the time as well
@leereed10 haha. I'll take all the fans I can get! You'd look good in all the gear <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@leereed10 did you have a bet or are you mocking me Reed?!!
@CBarks11 thank you (I think?). We will struggle. But beat them once &amp; who knows what can happen. Just glad to actually make the play offs.
@CBarks11 yeah ur right. We've been crap This is the what the 5th 1 &amp; done year in a row? #whodey Yes exactly. Who are they? Thanks Dalton.
@CBarks11 pahahaha. Worst. Comeback. Ever. All about money for fans? Not success or wins? Or are you just bitter? I think the latter.
@CBarks11 @Bengals Whoops! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@BritishBolts amen. Driving em on. Happy to keep flying under the radar. Just need Mathews &amp; Hardwick healthy. Ohrnberger been good though!
@BritishBolts still not getting credit from the announcers. Sky are bigging us up. CBS just pretty much saying it's all on the Bengals.
@markchinery @RichardYates24 already beat em. But they will be expecting it &amp; better against the run with players back fit.
Game over. Bye Bye Cinci <WAVING HAND SIGN>. Chargers got it done (in the end). #SDvsCIN #NFLPlayoffs #boltup
@markchinery @RichardYates24 Ronnie Brown is a pensioner haha. Just the small matter of Denver with an injured Mathews and no Hardwick <NEUTRAL FACE>
@markchinery @RichardYates24 sorry. I keep forgetting Dalton is QB. Ingram having a huge game.
@markchinery @RichardYates24 nah. Needed a TD and not a FG there. Gives them a big chance. Especially with mathews hurt.
@RichardYates24 still plenty of time Ricardo.
@johnnygrundle getting good pressure here. Dalton was uncomfortable on every snap there. No huddle again please &amp; mix up the plays.
@UTgehlken and then a 2 minute explanation. Then another minute to spot it. Then 2 more to talk it over with his crew. #boring
Hahaha. Dalton you fucktard. What are you thinking. Let's go bolts.
@chargers stop using Minnesota's playbook. Mathews is good. But Adrian Peterson he is not. Too conservative. Lost momentum.
@C4NFL Bengals. Chargers committed to the run &amp; too predictable &amp; conservative. Also have no deep threat. Bengals to win by 14.
@ChargersRHenne stop running the ball every single play &amp; mix it up like the scoring drive. &amp; grow some balls &amp; stop being so conservative!
@chargers Newmarket, England. #boltup
@Kimberly_bell88 <BICYCLIST><DASH SYMBOL>
@harry_kenneth haha. It come on in the car earlier. Immediately thought of Big Jesse Ventura!!
Bunch of slack-jawed faggots around here. This stuff will make you a god damned sexual Tyrannosaurus, just like me.
Wet Sham. Pahahaha.
@samreed9 can still get in if you go to the ticket office and have proof or purchase. Maybe...
@jamieday11 yes mate. What a comeback!
Not a bad start to Wildcard Weekend! 7-7 already! #KCvsIND #NFLPlayoffs
