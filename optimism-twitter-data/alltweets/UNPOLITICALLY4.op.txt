@sylv0028 @NothappyMatt @CBSNews Lol. True. Seeing what foolish responses they come up with can be fun.
@sylv0028 @NothappyMatt @CBSNews You waste your time trying to explain things to some ppl. They don't want to understand what ur saying.
I hate when ppl apologize just because they think that's what you want them to do. If u don't mean it, don't say it.
I gotta see this Jaz vs Official battle. Ppl tweetin they both going crazy and then sayin Jaz got bodied. I'm confused.
@JohnJohnDaDon From the updates it seem like they might be saying that based on crowd reaction?
Sounds like Jaz &amp; Official having the best battle so far.
@Dasani605 @OfficialRealRap Sounds like they going @ it.
@Logic413 @JazTheRapper @rapgrid  is
@Sh0wtime614 @ChefMode_Trez I'm not watching either but everybody I'm following that's giving updates said 3-0 for K Shine. js.
As someone that wants to own my own business I don't give a damn if I have insurance I don't wanna see something I worked hard for destroyed
That's a good story. Ppl so quick to say who cares they looted,the store is insured &amp; can be rebuilt. U don't know ppls situations.
@Dasani605 @rapgrid Lol. I was just asking cause I found out u can't go back and watch the ppv.
@Dasani605 @rapgrid Already following! Do u know how long the event is?
@JazTheRapper Good morning and good luck.
I only really wanna see 2 battles but I might wanna see them bad enough to order the PPV #NOME5
Really curious to see what angles @JazTheRapper  @OfficialRealRap  @CHARLIECLIPS &amp; @hollowdadon take in their battles #NOME5
Either I'm tired or these memes r funny as hell tonight.
@rapgrid @JazTheRapper @OfficialRealRap Def has the potential to be.
Great shot by D Rose, great win for the Bulls.
Rose!!!
@Dasani605 Yeah I don't have time for that.
@Dasani605 Yeah I might look into that or I might just look out for ur tweets lol.
@Dasani605 Yeah that should be a good 1 too. I'll be on the look out.
@Dasani605 Official vs Jaz &amp; Clips vs Hollow please!
@Dasani605 Cool! I'm sure ur gonna have a great time. I need some updates!
@Dasani605 You going to NOME?
Everyone wants to know that they're loved.
Forgot Blackish came on tonight. I wanted to see Raven.
To say I'm tired would be an understatement. #Exhausted #WorkingMother #StillGotSchoolWork
Hope Rose is alright. I'm tired of injuries messing up their playoffs.
Bulls just gotta play smart &amp; they can take game 1.
Can't sleep... Thinking of a master plan.
I don't ask for much.
Racists never went anywhere. His being elected just brought shit back to the forefront because they couldn't contain their racism.
Can't believe a comment I just read on FB saying that racism was a thing of the past until Prez Obama got in office. Huh? Smh. #Ignorance
It's a beautiful day outside. Maybe that's why I feel so happy &amp; optimistic.
I wanted the Spurs to win but I'm happy for CP3 &amp; the Clippers. Hard fought series, either team deserved to advance.
I didn't see the foul.
This damn basketball game is INTENSE!
I got in the line with all the fat ppl @ the movie theater smh. Taking forever.
Being broke is the greatest motivation.
I just hope Iggy is limited on the song because she absolutely sucks.
I'm trying to save my judgment of Britney Spears ft Iggy Azalea until I hear the song but that single cover doesn't make me feel any better.
The Bulls came to play tonight! #NBAPlayoffs
@CHARLIECLIPS The other night I was mad about it til it worked &amp; we won lol.
@EarlKSneed @Dallas_mffl Thought I was trippin. Smh.
I need Dallas to chill on the 3s for a minute.
#LetsGoMavs 1 more half to come back and keep this series going.

The Bulls bout to mess around &amp; make history... Not the good kind though.
@cthagod I get y they're attacking police but what does liquor, toilet paper, etc have to do with any of it?
@cthagod But do u really think that ppl stealin&amp; destroyin property r doin so out of frustration? Attacking cops is 1 thing thats another
I need the Bulls to get the W &amp; finish this series.
@BritBratAlexis Protesters r 1 thing but looters r another. A lot of ppl just looking for a reason to destroy &amp; get some free shit.
@BritBratAlexis what they're doing is against the law. Something has to be done to try to diffuse the situation b/c it won't diffuse itself.
@BritBratAlexis Personally I cant think of an alternative Law enforcement's job is 2 make sure ppl abide by the law. No matter the reasoning
@BritBratAlexis At this point do they have a choice? They can't just let chaos continue. Something has 2 b done 2 TRY 2 calm the situation.
I'm glad this news reporter separating the real protesters from those that just wanna steal shit.
Where the Baltimore police? I been watching ppl loot for an hr and haven't seen a cop.
This shit going on in Baltimore is out of control. They gon make it worse for themselves.
My Mavs looked good last night from what I was able to watch. Play 3 more games like that &amp; maybe history will be made. #MFFL #ItsNotOverYet
Mavs looking good!!! One game @ a time. #LetsGoMavs #NoSweep
What the fuck type coaching is Carlisle doing? Instead of playing d u just gon foul? Smh. I'm not in to that.
I was wondering where Kawhi Leonard was.
The Clippers bout to tie it up.
@DevanNeubauer @PerSources14 And Wade's looked more intentional. U couldn't tell with Kelly.
This the perfect opportunity for the Celtics but they can't make shit.
J.R.Smith &amp; Perkins need to be suspended.
What the fuck is going on. They fuckin Crowder up.
@az241 @DFW_SN @MavsGoon Hopefully Tyson plays like he's tryna make history &amp; don't give up 26 rebounds.
This Cavs Celtics game needs to be over already. Hope the Bulls get the Win tomorrow and we can move on to a competitive 2nd round matchup.
Crowder shouldn't have gotten a technical &amp; Perkins should've been thrown out.
My Mavs play 2night. Just gotta take it 1 game at a time. Odds r not in our favor but I'm forever an optimist. #LetsGoMavs #NoSweep #MFFL
@WhoDat_MFFL That would be a great look for Dallas but time will tell.
@WhoDat_MFFL I doubt that. San Antonio has Kawhi Leonard as their future who Dallas got?
That would be a great look for the Spurs if they got Lemarcus Aldridge.
@Dallas_mffl @NBA If what he said was the truth he shouldn't be fined. The officials gotta do better.
The Freddie Gray situation is so ridiculous. How do they say he was arrested without force but in the video he's in pain already.
and allowed Howard to get 26 rebounds smfh. He only had like 8 rebounds. Shit was sad.
Woke up still mad about the Mavs going down 0-3 to the Rockets. Tyson Chandler disappointed me most. 8 pts, 4 missed ft,
I'm gonna get tired of hearing about Bruce Jenner I can see that now.
Only thing to take my mind off that Dallas loss is this Bruce Jenner interview.
OMG!!
One more half Mavs! Get this win! One game @ a time.
Things are flowing a lot better right now.
Dallas looking good. Hope Dirk keeps making his shots.
Almost game time! This is a very important game. Might need Dirk to carry the team tonight like it's 2011. #LetsGoMavs #MFFL
Using my time wisely. #FeelingGood #BeingProductive
People really r sick. 1 lady left her quadriplegic son to die in the woods &amp; someone else left a fetus on a conveyor belt. Smh.
@Logic413 @rapgrid Good back &amp; forth battle.
@DTALLMUSIC She should lose her job for ethical reasons but def not 15 yrs in prison.
We still have 2 games to win before we get sent packing but from what I've seen SO FAR we won't beat Houston smh.
I hope Cuban starts giving ppl long-term contracts. This changing rosters every yr shit ain't cuttin it. Can't even build chemistry.
My Mavs look so out of sync. They need some changes frfr.
@LyricWise Lol. Damn shame.
I need a nap but I gotta finish this damn research project today.
@LyricWise So true! Dudes be like "Well we can just be friends." Smh. They sad.
People don't always tell you exactly how they feel about you, but it's nice when there's an action that shows you.
Omg that ice was soooo good! #cravings
And then she posed with it smh.
I wish some things could be unseen. Ugh. That damn vet that killed the cat with a bow and arrow is evil. How do you do some shit like that.
@PerSources14 I wanna see them make the NBA Finals or AT LEAST the Eastern Conference Finals.
My time off work can't come fast enough. I really can't wait.
Some things just really aren't logical.
I'm so unfamiliar with damn near everybody on my TV right now. #NBAPlayoffs  #HawksvsNets
Celtics ball movement could be much better. I think they'll lose the series, but each game they'll give a good fight.
Haven't seen this Celtics team play, but they look good.
I don't like this feeling.
Loving this Rondo.
Tied up!!! #LetsGoMavs
Mavs gotta do better and quick before shit gets outta hand.
Why the hell they keep leaving TERRY open? The Mavs of all teams should know about him.
Good to see D Rose looking good &amp; the Bulls getting the w. #MySecondFavoriteTeam
#LetsGoMavs #mffl
Anthony Davis is somethin else
New Orleans making this a game. Down 8 with 2 minutes.
@RyallTopdog630 NBA Playoffs
@RyallTopdog630 Who u rooting for?
Game day! #LetsGoMavs
-Mark Cuban 
Greatest. …
Listening to X Ambassadors to start this early morning. #MorningMusic
@RyallTopdog630 Good choice. The bad 1 pissed me off.
R.Kelly got CLASSICS! #LivingLegend
Might be time for a new blog.
Starbucks, Brew Ha Ha, etc. They all have a nice ring to them. I'm having trouble creating a name for my shop. #BusinessNames
I hate when shit that should be blown off nags @ me. Ugh. Too much thinking time. #GettingFocused #MovingOn
@LyricWise Agreed. There should be a balance.
@LyricWise It's cool until that becomes the norm. If I always txt 1st that mean u not thinkin bout me.
I'm not even gonna get comfortable when I get home. I gotta stay focused and get some things done. My situation HAS to change soon.
Some little things can tell you a lot about a person.
@NBA Picking the Warriors, Bulls, &amp; Mavs for Saturday's winners. #NBAPlayoffs
I'm picking Cavs, Hawks, Grizzlies, &amp; Spurs as Sundays winners.
NO Quick fixes
NO Blaming others
NO I'll do tomorrows
NO EXCUSES !!!
I've decided to treat others the way they treat me. #TreatMeGoodIllDoTheSame
Guess my Mavs r playing the Rockets! #LetsGoMavs #IBelieve
AFTER BLACK PEOPLE ; 
Every time I hear the theme song to 'A Different World' I'm reminded of when I used to watch and get ready for 5th grade. #Memories
@cthagod North. Blue Ivy's will be 1st so u know Kim &amp; Kanye gonna plan something to outdo whatever the Carters do.
I hope when I get old I'm not miserable like some of these mofos. Damn shouldn't u be thankful &amp; enjoying your last years on earth?
If that's the picture of Pink fat ppl's weight standards are fucked up. She looks good.
I think I would rather my Mavs play the Clippers, but we can get it done vs the Spurs too. #mffl #ImABeliever
Rappers that only post freestyles but no original music, what is the point? I'm really curious.
I hate when ppl tweet the same shit for retweets.
Chill time before I start this research paper that's due next week. #Procrastinator
When you have the same problems over and over again and they aren't solved, is it over? #QuestionsForMyself
After watching that video of Eric Harris my mouth dropped. "Fuck your breath." Wow. Smh.
Today is a BEAUTIFUL day and I REFUSE to let miserable ppl ruin it for me.
I understand the Mother bein upset about her son being "attacked" by a grown man ,but they went 2 far. A hammer &amp; wood to the head? Too far
What in the fuck is going on? Smh.
@Tsu_Surf You're popular w/ a large fan base. I hate when ppl act like they better than someone b/c of VIEWS.
I'm feeling lucky!
My brain is not with my body today smh. Of course ppl want to have convos.
It cold,I'm tired, time for work... #Morning

Success is based on what you do and what you have done.
@BlizzyBlack I don't even try to. They won't get extra money out of me for 1 new feature. #NoThankYou lol.
@PerSources14 I hate that all media outlets do that. We rarely remember the victims names or faces because most focus is on the murderers.
Its been a long day
Without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
The ending of Fast &amp; Furious was sad, but I like how they did it. 'See You Again' playing makes it sadder. #RIPPaulWalker
I trust my gut instinct these days. I've regretted not doing so in the past. #LessonLearned
@Mavs_FFL Always! Gotta have faith. #mffl
Overwhelmed right now.
@CowboysNation__ @nfl Lol. I'm a woman but my first thought was, Oh Lord!
Finally off work!! #ItsBeenALongTimeComin
In my lazy mode. Would love to be laying in my bed reading a book. Unfortunately I don't get paid to do that... Yet.
Tired...it's Friday though.
@LyricWise Yup lol.
Today isn't starting good.
People quick to switch up when they get shit...money,cars, etc. #RememberThatBecauseIWill
I hate when I think someone said something but I'm not sure &amp; when I ask them what they said they won't say.
The nicer the weather the more these smokers smoke. I don't smoke but I do tweet so I'll do that. #FairIsFair
@chillajones I took my son to a barber like that before but the no English speaking was too much for me lol.
R.I.P Selena. I hate the end of that movie and the worst part is knowing it's true. Such a senseless killing.
I seriously cannot wait to go to sleep. #SoTired
@RyallTopdog630 Welcome back!
Didn't know it was supposed to be nice out today but I'll take it.
You gotta choose your battles. Some things just aren't worth your energy.
Another day, another dollar. In time it'll be more than that. #GoodMorning #Motivated
There's so much more to life than this little city I live in. I wanna see as much as I can. #SmallCityBigDreams
The older I get the more I see how dramatically different me &amp; my immediate family are. We just see shit totally different.
Narrow minded people drive me crazy. Ugh.
@PlanetBattleRap @DAYLYT2k No
@sincerebo88 That's gonna be a classic.
@Da_Don_VET I love back and forth battles.
I detest edited songs. #GiveMeTheRealThingPlease
@Logic413 Are u gonna be there?
@Logic413 Ha ha. Yeah cause I'm thinking if there's 1 he prepared more 4 it would be the Rookies vs Vets.
@Logic413 And DNA &amp; Chess will be close.
@Logic413 John John da Don and Charlie Clips the only ppl I can say will win The others Im only familiar w/1 of the battlers so cant say.
'Get Hard' was funny but not as funny as I thought it would be.
I hate when ppl get forgetful cause it's convenient. Smh.
FAV: Spurs<MEDIUM BLACK CIRCLE>️<OLDER MAN> 
Gonna go see 'Get Hard' tonight. It looks really funny. I'm convinced Will Farrell can do no wrong in movies.
This weather weird as hell. 5 minutes ago it was hot &amp; the sun was out. Now it's dark,gloomy, and cool
@JazTheRapper I'm a be watching on Saturday.
Let me TRY to get a couple hours of sleep.
If I could sleep that would be awesome.
If the simplest things can separate us we probably don't need to be together anyway. #LateNightThoughts
I want something really good to eat but don't know what.
Why ppl actin like that girl said something was wrong wit Dumbledore being gay? I think J.K. Rowling just overreacted &amp; misunderstood her.
I just randomly thought of The Big Comfy Couch. Used to love to nap while that was on.
Mavs won! Yay! That was much needed. #MavsNation #mffl
I'm a Mavs fan but I seriously didn't see a foul lol.
I thought Bill Goldberg died! I was like wtf?!
It irritates me I can't find a Mavs fitted in my area for my son. They're crazy expensive online.
FAV: Spurs
#DALvsSAS 
I need a new laptop! That's what keep me from writing or at least that's what I've told myself.
Small city, big dreams... #GoodNight #TomorrowIsANewDay #AnotherChance
If you can't even do simple things I ask of you why are we still together? #Questions
Ugh, I only have 2 hrs left of sleeping time and I can't go back to sleep. #ThisSucks
Woke up still mad about some bullshit smh. I gotta let it go but I can't right now.
I like to have my own so I don't have to ask ANYONE for shit.
Just started reading this book One Night Stand. It's really captivating.
Steve Nash never got a ring, but he had a great career anyway. Congrats to him on his retirement.
I strongly dislike pessimistic ppl. Try to be positive and believe good things are to come sometimes. Smh. #WontLetThemGetMeDown
It's funny how ppl became "celebrities" b/c they are teen moms. #Sad #TheseAreTheTimes
My son is going to be upset if Donatello is dead. Why they gotta kill one of the main characters smh.
It would be awesome if on the first day of Spring we didn't have Winter like weather. #SoDepressing
The leads back to 15! #LetsGoMavs
Finally get to see my Mavs play. They look good right now. #MavsNation #mffl
I could use a nap.
@Willie_Rucker A freeze cup.
@PerSources14 Lmao. I said he looked like 1 of the turtles to my boyfriend when the game was on.
D.Wade looking good tonight.
But that shit only matter when u give a damn
@RyallTopdog630 Good choice. I wanna watch it again now cause I can't remember everything that happened.
@RyallTopdog630 I saw it. It was really good. I didn't like the ending though.
@RyallTopdog630 Is that the 1 with Hugh Jackman?
Russell Westbrook can't be stopped.
Bulls down by 5 going into the 4th. This should be an exciting ending.
If the Bulls could stay healthy I really think they could go far. They do so well even w/out their top players. So much potential.
I want some strawberry lemonade from Wendy's. It's so addictive and refreshing.
I hate that I'm up. Ain't shit on TV and opening my laptop to write is too exhausting.
@RyallTopdog630 Me too!
That Dame Dash interview was very interesting. I personally want to own my own business, but I know that's not for everyone.
@JazTheRapper Lmao. #HappyPiDay
@JazTheRapper Technically sweet potato pie only has crust too &amp; a bunch of other pies. Guess it's a matter of opinion though lol.
@JazTheRapper Cheesecake might be pie though. It's crust with filling, sounds like pie.
Hate when I'm up early thinking bout bullshit.
Eagles fans happy as shit today lol. #FuckYall lol. #CowboysNation #ImReadyForSomeFootball

I've been away from my fictional characters for too long. I miss them. #Writer #GottaGetReacquainted
@Dallas_mffl I would still like to see him back. Can't be mad at him tryna get the best deal even if it is w/the Eagles.
Sometimes u gotta be a mirror for people. They tend to not like what they see. #OhWell #ThisIsYou
So many changes going on in the NFL. I can't keep up. I just hope my Cowboys go in a positive direction. #CowboysNation #NFLFreeAgency
@PerSources14 Nah we just gotta get everybody clicking. Maybe by the playoffs, hopefully.
If Demarco Murray goes to the Eagles I'm a be beyond pissed. I want him on the Cowboys but he can go anywhere but the damn Eagles.
@DylanTheMan37 Smh. We shall.
@BlizzyBlack Lol.
@DylanTheMan37 Noooo! He can't do that!
@BlizzyBlack My bf did.
I so need a nap right now.
After the first watch I had Shotty Horrah over Hitman Holla 2-1. I would like Shotty a lot more w/out that accent though.
So tired but it's nice outside so of course the little one wants to go out.
#FavoriteThemeSongs Saved by the Bell, A Different World, Golden Girls, Full House, Fresh Prince of Bel Air, &amp; The Jeffersons

When u don't want to go about things the typical way it's definitely gonna be hard, but I think the payoff will be worth it.
Gotta look into some quick ways to make money without spending a lot of money.
While writing down some business ideas I realized you need a substantial amount of money for EVERYTHING.
Haven't really had many ideas flowing lately so I think I better take advantage of it right now. #Entrepreneur #Goals
Chayna Ashley vs @40BARRSBOSTON should be good too. #QOTR
Queen of the Ring comin back! Been waiting for @DaRealC3 &amp; @MsDotFit1 2 battle. Should be classic.
The Spurs get their shit together @ the right time.
People so damn sensitive these days. Smh.
I was excited about leaving the house today,but this toothache had other plans. It sucks not being able to take pain medication.
Supposed to be 38° today, I'm excited! #ThatsSad #ItsBeenTooDamnCold #LetsGoSummer
This toothache that has resulted in a headache as well, is really fucking up my nap I wanted to take.  #Ugh
@JazTheRapper Do u have any original songs or have u just released freestyles so far?
Can't wait til this work day is over. #CountingDown #TGIF
I like Xbox1 but I don't like it at the same time. Had 2k for 2 days &amp; still haven't been able to play it because of installation problems.
Schools closed. Why can't my job close in anticipation of snow.
I really just wanna play 2k15 but this installation is taking like 5 hrs. Sheesh! Its been stuck on the same percentage forever.
@RyallTopdog630 Damn. Gotta love winter.
@RyallTopdog630 Y'all gettin snow or ice? We got ice smh.
Back to work today.
FAV FOR A MAVS WIN
@BrandyLuvli Well yeah there r a lot of those ppl too lol.
@BrandyLuvli U nvr know it could be a relationship, a job, their own place, their looks. Ppl find anything to hate on.
I've been in the house for like 3 days straight. #Depression is starting to kick in. Sheesh. I need some fresh air.
The ice outside is really ridiculous. #Winter #EastCoast #WestCoastDreaming
I treat everyone with respect until given a reason not to. I'm not impressed by titles, more by character.
Some fried chicken, broccoli, and macaroni &amp; cheese would be perfect right now.
I need to get up and do something. Scrolling on Twitter has gotten boring.
The Golden Girls is 1 of a few shows that makes me laugh every time I watch it.
I have no idea what any of it means.
The dream I had was so weird. I was n Vegas with someone that is dead &amp; he was being hunted down to be killed. Later there was a transgender
Getting dressed early today so I can maximize my productivity. #BackFocused #ThingsGottaChange
Got a craving for some soda...it'll have to wait til later this a.m.
If the video I saw on TMZ is the vid that's supposedly 5 x worse than the Ray Rice 1 ppl r idiots. He's not even in the damn video.
The first black player to play in the NBA..
I don't feel like being bothered today. Of course everyone wants to talk.
I'm so confused. What is this dress everyone is talking about? I don't get it.
It's snowing again :-( ...But at least it's Friday. #TGIF
@HitmanHolla If u go outside of the music industry tho I'm pretty sure more people know Kanye. He's the bigger star.
@WhoDat_MFFL Definitely! Good chance of goin to the Finals if that can happen. We'll see.
@WhoDat_MFFL They dont show many Mavs games where I am so I havent seen him w/them but in Bos he was 1of the best. Gotta find his fit in Dal
@WhoDat_MFFL Hope they work it out though. He's 1 of the best pgs in the league.
@WhoDat_MFFL They will if he can't coexist with the coach.
Rondo gotta get his shit together. My Mavs don't have the bullshit. I'VE nvr HEARD of any player/coach issues before now.
The saying "Misery loves company" is the realest shit ever.
I wanna write about people and their fake outrage, but gotta figure out how I wanna structure it. #OverIt #FakeOutrage #ShitNeedsToStop
I wrote a blog about the police killings of black men and never posted it smh. It's still not too late I guess.
Damn D Rose injured AGAIN?! Smh. I was looking forward to what they could do in the post season.
People goin real hard on Guliana Rancic. I don't think she's racist she just made a bad joke.
Ugh I really don't wanna get up for work. Oh well. #ThankfulForLife #GetThisWorkDayOver
@cthagod Do u think y'all will ever have Beyonce on the show? It would be good to see her do a show like the Breakfast Club.
While I don't know of any talents Kim Kardashian has I'm not sure how making a sex tape with her BOYFRIEND makes her a whore. #Confused
@jamielynnspears Do you want to do anymore acting? Either TV or movies.
Finally get to relax. Pretty sure I will have no problem sleeping tonight.
If Dez Bryant &amp; Demarco Murray not back fuck Jerry Jones. Clearly he don't wanna win if he don't get them back.
@DezBryant @FrankyGonzalez3 @dallascowboys I don't like that kinda talk. We NEED u back!  #CowboysNation
@EverybodyHatesV @BlizzyBlack Lol. That did cross my mind.
@BlizzyBlack I'm tryna figure out how the hell u even get a torn acl in a fight.
Not sure how I feel about Amare Stoudemire goin to the Mavs. He been so broke up for so long, but I haven't seen him play this yr.
I don't think cold is the correct word for how it feels outside today. #CantWaitTilSummer #CantWaitToSwitchCoasts
Gonna watch the 2nd half of the all star game. They usually play defense by then.
I don't think I really laughed at SNL even 1 time.  Just nvr thought it was funny. I like some of the former cast members though.
How u get out on bail if u admitted to murdering someone? Tf!
@JazTheRapper What r sticky wings?
All publicity really is good publicity Im bout 2 go download some of Erykah Badu music. It would work 4 Azealia Banks if her music was good.
@BrandyLuvli Exactly. I'm the only non smoker, even the boss smokes smh. I can't use my phone but they can smoke every hr  smh.
@BrandyLuvli I got a person I work w/ that within 15 mins of being @ work will go smoke smh.
@BrandyLuvli When I open my own business &amp; have employees that'll be a ? I ask. If ur a smoker there's a good chance u won't be hired lol.
U been there 20 yrs ,but the person that's been there 2 yrs works harder than fuck those 20 yrs. U work for what u want. That's how I think.
while they get paid more than me just b/c they been there longer.
The shit that I do @ my job I could be doing for my own business w/out the bullshit of ppl taking credit or expecting me to do everything
Think I'm gonna try to come up with a mission statement for my business. #Entrepreneur #TakingStepsToGetItAllTogether
The high is gonna be 12° today. I'm a try my damnest not to go out.
It's snowing.  Can't wait for Spring.
  <REVOLVING HEARTS> Happy Valentine's Day <REVOLVING HEARTS>
I'm off work for 3 days I gotta get in my creative zone. #Writer
If u say, "I'm a let it go," but u can't let it go it probably needed to be discussed.
I gotta stop tryna figure fake ppl out.
What to eat on this Friday night?
If I win the power ball I wanna remain anonymous. That said I need to actually play it so maybe I can win.
Never heard Ed Sheeran before last night, but I think I'm a fan now. Love his voice.
If anyone won album of the year I thought it should've been Sam Smith.
Kanye really is an asshole. Anyone that he doesn't like isn't a real artist is what he basically said. Smh.
Kristen Wig was really good during that Sia performance. Wasn't sure if that was her or not. #GRAMMYs
My fav performances so far have been Miranda Lambert &amp; Ed Sheeran w/John Mayer. #Unexpected #GRAMMYs
I used to like Adam Levine's voice now I hate it.
I kinda like this song by Miranda Lambert. #GRAMMYs
If I nvr hear Happy again it'll be too soon. Sheesh.
Sam Smith should win every award he's nominated for. #GRAMMYs
Bout time the right person wins Best New Artist @ the Grammys.
@RyallTopdog630 Damn. Hope u got ur snacks lol. That's what I'm always concerned about.
@RyallTopdog630 Agreed. We haven't had much snow, but tired of cold weather.
Wth is going on with the Clippers? They gettin their asses whooped again.
@cthagod Exactly what I was thinking. He's the only 1 I KNOW is working.
Feeling your baby kick is one of the greatest things. #JoysofPregnancy
Im an optimist &amp; believe unless ppl have it specifically written out they don't want to be on life support u should give them at least 2 wks
@RyallTopdog630 Oh yeah Spoelstra is a bum for sure. They might have something w/ Whitehead though. I think that's his name.
Now I would never disown my child but u gon have to wait til u 18 to get hormones and all that shit.
Im sorry but I dont think I could allow my son to transition into a girl. When u turn 18 do as u please but I can't c myself participating.
@RyallTopdog630 Hey! How u feel about ur Miami Heat? Still happy LeBron's gone?
@BrandyLuvli sometimes there is ,but I'm cool w/it for the most part.
@BrandyLuvli Introvert :-/
I'm just really confused about this whole Bruce Jenner transitioning into a woman thing. Why now? More power to him I guess.
French toast for dinner? Why not?!
@Dasani605 I don't know a lot of ppl but I do know some so I agree it's based on upbringing.
I didn't grow up in a family that was really affectionate so a lot of things are weird to me.
Is it weird to kiss ur parents on the lips? I know ppl that do,but I damn sure wouldn't. Think it's the way ur raised though.
At Least Your Coach Didn’t Kiss His Daughter On The Lips

@Willie_Rucker Hope all is well and u can go home soon.
I gotta get motivated cause I hate going to work EVERYDAY
I'm still smh @ that last play of the super bowl.
This rain really makes me wanna stay in bed. Ugh. #HappyMonday ?
What in the fuck?
These commercials r bullshit.
Missy the best part of this Half Time Show.
@ShepBSM Seahawks!
Serena Williams always seems to be serving to win the championship.
Hopefully the work day will fly by. Tryna make this weekend even more productive than the last.
#TGIF
My focus is nonexistent right now. I don't feel like working at all. #IsItFridayYet
Dirk Nowitzki vs Klay Thompson
Lillard won the last battle

{Rt} - Dirk
{Fav} - Klay 
I'm bout to order Papa Johns just so I can try their brownies lol.
@chillajones Oh. Lol. I think u did say that b4.
@chillajones What female battle rapper would u like to battle? #askchilla
People in this world are really sick. How the hell do u sexually assault ur 19 days old baby?
Watching Serena in the #AustralianOpen She looks really good.

Up listening to Jaheim. Work in a few hrs maybe I should go to sleep...
"As a well spent day brings happy sleep, So a life well spent brings happy death." #Quotes #Truth
Nvr heard of Whiteside until today but he's blocking every damn thing.
It's beautiful outside for the end of January. Gotta get out today cause there's some snow and really cold weather coming tomorrow.

Up early writing. #Writer
@officialchilli @NKOTB @Nelly_Mo So So Dumb
Trying to get my words together so I can finally post a new blog. #NewBlogger

“@QOTRING: Yall want @JohnJohnDaDon vs @DaRealC3 This Year?!”
Money is the motivation. #Motivated
Sooo tired. Gotta wait til I get my son off the bus then I can go to sleep. #CantWait

@BlizzyBlack Sooo cute!
#TGIF This getting up early shh is not cool.
Feels like I'm in a blur right now.
My bf low key a @JazTheRapper fan. I called him &amp; he asked me What battle Jaz the Rapper say "I got a gun so big that shit don't work."? Lol
@britneysgalaxy Early Morning
- Dr Ma…
Happy Martin Luther King day!
Patriots &amp; Seahawks in the Super Bowl just as I predicted. Should be a great battle.
That was hilarious. Ha ha.
@cthagod Lmao.
Ha ha ha ha! Green Bay fans feel like Cowboys fans last week. Well not maybe not as bad but they HURT.
Wow! That's a comeback right there.
If I'm Seattle I definitely don't want Green Bay to get the ball back.
Might be going to OT
Wow! Wow! Wow!
Gonna be an exciting end.
Seattle's coach is stupid. How do u NOT go for it on 4th down?
I feel like if Seattle don't score this drive they're losing the game.
My Cowboys could be in this game smh.
What in the fuck is wrong w/ Russell Wilson?
Clay Matthews ain't shit for that hit on Wilson.
Just started watching the game and the score is not what I expected.
My Cowboys r unfortunately out of the playoffs so I'm in hater mode today #LetsGoSeahawks #BeatGreenBay
Bout to lay here &amp; listen to some music.
I gotta get my sleep schedule situated. This is too early to be up on a Sunday.
I hate when I ask a question and instead of getting an answer in return I get a bunch of questions. #NeverMind
It's the weekend but I'm up early like I gotta work.
There really are evil ppl in this world. How the hell did this man put his girlfriend's 2 yr old in a DRYER?! U have to be a cold person.
R.I.P to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He was a strong leader and we owe a lot of the rights we have now to him.
I hate when large companies take over small ones smh. I liked shit the way it was. #Assholes
@BrandyLuvli I do. Not the life for me.
What I really wanna do is something I enjoy rather than something just for a paycheck.
I kinda wanna be a stay at home mom ,but I also wanted to work full time when I was in high school. #TheGrassAlwaysLooksGreener
@TreeLem Men don't care about being called a ho though.
Kinda excited for the classes I'm starting today. We'll see how long the excitement lasts.
FAV - No
#Cowboys #CowboysNation #Dalla…
I really hate winter time. This ice is ridiculous. I should've kept my ass home.
@RyallTopdog630 Forgot u hate the Seahawks too lol. I like them though. Damn sure don't wanna see Green Bay make it lol.
@RyallTopdog630 I don't like the Colts or Patriots &amp; prob like the Patriots less but I think they'll win.
Seahawks vs Patriots #MyPrediction #MyPredict for #SuperBowl2015
Found out the Broncos loss...I was rooting for Peyton after the Cowboys went out. Guess I'll root for the Seahawks to win it all again.
@Dasani605 I know. Its not the 1st tm &amp; won't be the last that the refs make a bad call. Always leaves players &amp; fans wondering what if.
@Dasani605 Yup. I think everybody knows that smh. Too late now though.
I would much rather lose on a non debatable call but that's just the way it went. Still #CowboysNation
Damn damn damn!
Please don't reverse that call!
Cowboys haters got their tweets saved in drafts ready to send them out lol.
Gotta score on this possession. #LetsGoCowboys #FinishTheFight
What tf is the point of all that pushing if no one is gonna take off a helmet? Smh. Stupid shit.
Damn Murray

Please stop the run next drive.

Sincerely,
Cowboys fans.
@RyallTopdog630 I'll take it.
Game time!!! #LetsGoCowboys #CowboysNation #Cowboys #WinOrGoHome
#CowboysNation
#Packers 8-0 at Home.
Something has to give #CowboysNation 
#WeDemBoyz #FinishTheFight 
LETS G…
We got llike 2 more hrs b4 game time! #FinishTheFight #CowboysNation
That's exactly what Bill Cosby was talking about. We can no longer blame white ppl.
U can only blame others for so long before u have to look at yourself and see what ur doing wrong.
Ppl's reaction 2 Kendrick Lamar's comments 2 Billboard magazine proves black people hate the truth. Love 2 blame everyone but themselves.
Flacco fucked up.
I'm picking the Ravens with the upset over the Patriots. #NFLPlayoffs
Let the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor that's how some see it.
I go 2 a community college &amp; most of the ppl I'm n class with r there @ night b/c they WORK full-time during the day. #FreeCommunityCollege
Its funny to me how these ppl that r against #FreeCommunityCollege assume everyone who goes to a Community College doesn't pay taxes.
@TreeLem That would require getting out from under my covers &amp; I can't do that right now lol.
It doesn't even feel like I have the heat on right now. Can't do shit but lay under these covers.
Schools r really opening late 2mrw because it's supposed to be so cold. Some r closed. How damn cold is it gonna be? #BetterBundleUp #Winter
@QueenzFlip @JazTheRapper @OfficialRealRap Smaller setting. Jaz is better in a smaller setting.
I actually wanna see @OfficialRealRap &amp; @HitmanHolla battle so if she's going to make her URL debut I hope it's against him.
@JazTheRapper Official or Couture r the only ppl u need to battle.
Of course most of us only document our happiest moments. Especially if we're taking pictures of it.
According to Instagram everyone I went 2 school w/ is doin great. I think 2 myself ,"I can't possibly be the only 1 not where I want to be.
I've been having some straaange dreams.

Back to work :'( #ImNotReady
@RyallTopdog630 Yup. They better come better nxt week but for now I'll just be happy about this win.
@RyallTopdog630 Glad u were right. It was a nail biter though.
Woo hoo!! Got the 1st playoff win! #CowboysNation
Defense hold up pleeease!
Damn. Defense did their job &amp; offense couldn't get anything smh. Can't let those opportunities go wasted.
Or none.
Or 3.
Let's get 7!

Hopefully we find the D during halftime.
Come on Cowboys defense!
Hopefully this is the start of some positive changes. #LetsGoCowboys
@Dasani605 Thank you!
@RyallTopdog630 Lol. I know ur rooting for the other team. It's all good.
@RyallTopdog630 Watching the game. Waiting for my Cowboys.
My Mavs been killin it! I really do believe this could be another championship year!  #Mffl #LetsGoMavs
 
The game will go 1 of 2 ways... #LetsGoCowboys #CowboysNation 
Last day of me not having to get up @ the ass crack of dawn. :-(
This game is sad.
If the Cardinals don't score here they deserve to lose.
In due time, we'll be fine...
I've been so disappointed with albums lately. J.Cole is exceptional though.
@Dasani605 Yup. Overall the playoffs should be competitive.
I've been craving collard greens, cabbage, tuna macaroni salad, and deviled eggs smh.I need to hit up a grocery store 2mrw.
@Dasani605 I'm a Cowboys fan so depending on how the playoffs go maybe we'll meet in the Super Bowl!
@Dasani605 You're a Patriots fan right?
I'm hungry for every damn thing that's not in the house smh.
Had plans of leaving the house today but sounds like it's raining. #OhWell
@TexSR_Ryan Oh lol. I'm not up on the Celtics roster.
@TexSR_Ryan The coach? Or Jeff Green if he's still on the team.
@RyallTopdog630 I refuse to cook anything lol. 
IM very indecisive and lazy too right now.
@RyallTopdog630 Nah.Not a fan.
Dinner choices get harder and harder to make.
I talked to 3 different ppl, waited for 15 minutes, and still have to call back Monday to get the answer to my question!  #ThatsTheBullshit

@RyallTopdog630 Ha ha! I don't rap AT ALL lol. Probably could freestyle though.
@RyallTopdog630 I watch them on YouTube. URL is the main league so u can look them up. I actually started out watching the females.
@RyallTopdog630 Yup. I became a battle rap addict like 2 yrs ago. U watch?
There were so many mediocre rap battles in 2014.  Hopefully this yr will be better.
If I owned a battle rap league I swear I would NEVER book Daylyt. Too many antics not enough rap.
It's so nice to be able to stay in bed as long as I want.
@RyallTopdog630 Lol. Be safe out there.
@RyallTopdog630 That's happened to me 2x. Hate when the driver looks @ me like it was my fault.
@Iheardthatshit Chris Brown was in mine lol. Wonder what that means.
One day I won't be so excited about tax returns but for now I am.
It's tax season! #ImExcited lol.
@RyallTopdog630 I know the feeling. New year same shit lol.
I had a very weird dream last night.
It's better to say too much than never to say what you need to say again.
I liked the show Teen Moms ,but there's no reason entertainment shows r still talking about them.
Amber Rose, Teen Moms, etc. r all makin the news.Confused b/c Im not y. 2015 gotta b the yr non talented ppl stop becoming famous.
These late night cravings are a pain in the ass. I want some strawberries and peach rings.
#NowPlaying @britneyspears #WorkBitch Such an inspirational song lol. Really it is though.
Fucked up start to 2015. Losing almost EVERYTHING I've ever written is not helpful in my productivity.
I can't find my flash drive with all my writing ideas, rough drafts, etc. Basically my whole writing life is on it. #WriterProblems
I'm predicting the Cardinals, Steelers, Colts, &amp; Cowboys all get wins. #NFLPlayoffs
Don't want it to be Sunday but at the same time I do. Ready to see my Cowboys get a win! #CowboysNation
I keep forgetting it's only Thursday.  Feels like the weekend already cause I was off yesterday.
Trying to find many ways outside of my 9-5 to make money. That way I don't have to be as reliant on it.
I definitely want to blog more this yr. I have to see what my 1st 1 can be about.
@RyallTopdog630 Happy New Year!
@RyallTopdog630 Me unfortunately. Good morning.
Happy New Year! #2015
All of a sudden I want some munchkins smh.
I really hate ppl that drink &amp; drive. So many innocent lives r lost b/c of foolishness.
As much as it's said "Don't drink and drive", ppl do what they want &amp; will drink and drive tonight just as they normally do.
Too early for useless thoughts to be running through my head.

Watch: 
We're falling apart. I don't know if I should just let the pieces fall or try to catch them before they hit the point of no return.
5 days off work after today!!!! Yes, I am excited!
Another slow day @ work so I think I'll write down some goals for 2015. #NewYear #NewGoals
I'm feeling very motivated this morning!
@Entrepreneur Admirable.
Almost done w/ work! All Im thinkin about is a nap! I had productive thoughts ,now reality has hit &amp; I no nothing will get done w/out a nap
@CowboyChuck_DAL @nflnetwork #Romo
Why every body gotta use automated systems? So annoying.
Only gotta get through 2 days ,but I still don't feel like being @ work smh.
I wanted pork chops ,but seems I'll be eating something other than that.
@RyallTopdog630 Oh ok. We'll see how that plays out.
@RyallTopdog630 Who u rootin for in the playoffs?
Now that the regular season is over the road to the Super Bowl begins! #LetsGoCowboys #CowboysNation
FAV for Panthers 
My boredom level is pretty high right now.
Too bad I can't watch the Cowboys/Redskins game. Sounds like it's going great.
When u lose passion for something, leave it alone.
@cthagod They waitin though.
Can't even watch the Cowboys vs Redskins game. But anyway, #LetsGoCowboys
I want some frosted flakes and bananas, but I have neither smh
I HAVE TO BE. There's no other option.
Is this what it feels like to fall out of love?
@RyallTopdog630 Thanx for the encouragement.
@RyallTopdog630 1st playoff win for Romo woo hoo! Lol. Maybe.
@RyallTopdog630 Yeah well either them or the Falcons/Panthers depending on who wins that game.
@RyallTopdog630 I thought they were doing good even with the back up qb?
@RyallTopdog630 We shall see. I'll decide if I wanna say this may be the super bowl yr once game 1 starts.
@RyallTopdog630 Of course! Lol.
@RyallTopdog630 Ha! We do want our revenge! More importantly tho we're n the playoffs so as long as we do somethin there 2mrws not a biggie.
A lot of women would be average at best without makeup. Glad I never got caught up in that. #NoMakeUp #WhatYouSeeIsWhatYouGet
I should a kept my ass home a while longer. Food ain't even done yet.
I have nvr watched all of 'A Christmas Story'  so I'm gonna try today.
I'm up way too early.
@Dasani605 @Walgreens No prob.
@Dasani605 @Walgreens They open every day. Usually close around 6 p.m.on major holidays.
My energy level is on 2. Nap time and then I gotta wrap presents.
@chillajones True.
Don't feel like getting out of bed because it's pouring down raining. Oh well. Last day til next week.
I'm really confused about this whole Iggy Azalea situation. Why isn't she allowed to do hip hop?
I want some fried chicken. Ugh. #LateNightCravings
Damn my Mavs love playing from behind. Guess they ran out of time again though.
Can't wait to have some days off. I need some me time.
I don't like the way I'm feeling right now.
@RyallTopdog630 Yesss!
Making the playoffs is just the beginning, but we're in and the Eagles are NOT!  #ImHappy
Great win! #LetsGoCowboys #CowboysNation
@RyallTopdog630 But it's 35-ZERO. For now at least. That's unbelievable.
No one would have believed the Cowboys would be up 35-0 in the 4th. It's happening though.
Interception!!
I wanna talk shit but I know the game's not over yet.
Feeling like my Cowboys really wanna secure their playoff spot. Keep it up! #CowboysNation
Touchdown Cowboys!
Touchdown!!
Ok Cowboys defense!
@cjm_90 Nope!  They were @ the same award show &amp; managed to avoid 1 another.
I have a good feeling about this game. Hopefully my feeling is right. #LetsGoCowboys #CowboysNation
Thanks 2 @amazon I received the rest of my son's gifts 2day. Had them stolen from my porch &amp; they refunded me &amp; paid for 2 day shipping.
I was going out to exchange something but not today. This Sunday will be a relaxing 1.
#BlueLivesMatter is true but they always have. I don't know of any situations where justice wasn't served on their behalf.
Ppl will only take out of every situation what they want to take out.
The protests weren't putting blame on every cop ,but rather asking for changes that will prevent this from repeatedly happening.
No one is to blame but the man that killed them. Just as every cop isn't to blame for the deaths of those killed by other cops.
Its sad 2read that some ppl really believe protesters, Al Sharpton, NYC mayor, &amp; even the President Obama is 2 blame for the 2 cops killed.
At least they don't have the lead.
That's sad what happened to the 2 police officers in Brooklyn.
I'm #CowboysNation though.
Get this win Redskins!
Been in traffic almost 2 fucking hrs. I'm so annoyed.
Some people just wanna be seen...
I won $4 on a $2 scratch off, 10 on a $5, now I'm a try a $10. Maybe this will be the $500 or more card. #Gambling #TrynaHitBig
The fact that my bf broke his Xbox 360 might be a sign it's time for us to get the Xbox 1.
I really can't believe my Mavs have Rajon Rondo! Can't wait to watch the first game.
@RyallTopdog630 Ok cool.
@RyallTopdog630 I'm actually rooting for ur team lol. What time is the game?
Still pissed about my packages ,but Rondo on the Mavs?!  Woo hoo!
I'm pissed right now cause I've ordered online countless times before &amp; now somebody done stole my shit I ordered smh. Really wanna know who
If u want something done Correctly do it urself.
@BlizzyBlack Chris Rock.
I get high cause the lows can be so cold. I might bend a little ,but I don't fold...
"I got 4 brothers, 1 mother, that dont love us. If they aint want us y the fuck they nvr wore rubbers?" Thats a deep story. #03Adolescence
#NowPlaying "03' Adolescence" by J. Cole.
Time has been moving pretty fast so I can't complain.
Tryna get through this work day.
I really gotta stop with the late naps. Tomorrow I'm a try to get my sleep schedule back on track.
The Saints look really good ,but maybe that's because they're playing the Bears. Idk.
I want some bbq food.
So Demarco Murray has to have surgery on his hand smh. Someone really just doesn't want to see my Cowboys succeed.
I'm extremely tired yet I'm listening to Sam Smith lol.
#CowboysNation !!! We needed that win! Congrats!
Fumble?! We'll see.
Cowboys looking better. #LetsGoCowboys #CowboysNation
Can't stay up but #LetsGoCowboys ! This is a MUST win game. Eagles can't get 2 wins on us &amp; we need to take their spot.
@not_romo They need to change that.
Down 12.
My Mavs gettin their ass kicked. We got 2 more quarters though. #LetsGoMavs #Mffl
 
I shouldn't have taken a nap. Now I'm up craving a damn milkshake.
I love Kobe lol. I usually hate arrogant ppl but him &amp; Michael Jordan can get away w/ it.
I think @HitmanHolla  gonna battle Charron. That would be interesting.

RETWEET If You Got @Cassidy_Larsiny
FAVOURITE If You Got @MrDizaster 

Tryna do my 8 &amp; get the hell out of here.
Not feeling work today at all.
#LetsGoMavs !! Got the w now on to the nxt 1.
Today has turned out to be a good day. I finished school for the semester &amp; get to watch my Mavs on tv. #ImHappy
Ideally I would be somewhere where it's warm, sitting by the pool reading or writing a book while my chef prepares breakfast. #Dreams
@804StreetMedia That was mostly my understanding, but I thought maybe there was something else that I didn't know about.
@804StreetMedia With Trayvon I know they wanted the stand your ground law changed but I don't know what EXACTLY this 1 is for.
@804StreetMedia This is a legit question because I don't know, what exactly r ppl protesting for? What's the end result they're looking for?
Finally home!  So thankful this is the last week of classes. I'm ready to temporarily get my life back.
All I wanna do is take a nap but I have other obligations after work. Ugh.
One of those mornings where I can't make myself get out of bed. It's too comfortable.
@Logic413 Who the hell said that?
@Iheardthatshit @CASSIDY_LARSINY @MR_DIZASTER Yeah he had some parts I liked, but I just liked Cassidy better.
@Iheardthatshit @CASSIDY_LARSINY @MR_DIZASTER If I was to give him 1 it would be that 1.
@Iheardthatshit You're welcome.
@Iheardthatshit 
@Iheardthatshit vs. Dizaster. The 1 that happened yesterday.
Cassidy won 3-0 after my first watch. The 1st round was the best though.
Only got to watch the first round but I think Cassidy did really good.
Hold on I might not want the Seahawks to win lol. I gotta reconsider some things.
Lets go Seahawks. Beat these damn Eagles.
Damn the Giants up 30-0 on the Titans!? Either the Titans suck or the Giants got their shit 2gether.
@BlizzyBlack I did most of mine online so it didn't take much lol.
@BlizzyBlack Mostly.
Personal chef &amp; housekeeper will be top priorities if I ever get rich.
Sitting here fantasizing about being rich so I could afford a personal chef.  I'm hungry but too lazy to get up to cook something.
@BlizzyBlack Yeah. As long as he don't show up like Reed Dollaz I think he good. He always been better than him anyway tho.
@BlizzyBlack Hopefully Cassidy
I wanna hear some updates on the Cassidy / Dizaster battle. I hope Cassidy does well cause so many don't think he will.
I will accomplish my goals for today! #IBelieve
I was trying to be productive but guess that wasn't in the plans. Gonna have so much to do 2mrw smh.
@Rene_gadeCowboy *chooses* not choices.
@Rene_gadeCowboy Whether or not a woman choices to continue a pregnancy is a personal choice not a matter for the world to decide on.
@Rene_gadeCowboy Pretty sure unless the case isn't solved the murderer is put in prison. No need for riots, justice has been served.
The murderer is in prison awaiting trial, where is the injustice? Why the hell would anyone be protesting? Smh. Ppl r sad.


@Rene_gadeCowboy The outrage comes because there is no justice. This guy won't be back on the streets.
Sometimes no matter how hard you try to make someone happy it'll be in vain. At that point you gotta let it go until they're ready.
@Logic413 I only watched like 2 battles but I liked the editing of Syndicate Cartel. The battles were good 2.
I just need to finish up this math class &amp; I will be happy.
Sounds like my 2 teams had a hell of a game. Good job to both but my Mavs got it done!  #LetsGoMavs #Mffl

Give this a RT to wish Britney a happy birthday! 

Show Info: 
None of the ppl I work with could ever work for me. They would all be fired. From not knowing how to prioritize to bad inventory control.
Lazy people really piss me off. Acting like I'm working is so much more work than actually working for me. Guess they have a lot of practice

I woke up feeling optimistic.
I could eat rice with gravy everyday.
Aaron Rodgers is so accurate. I've been in denial but he's the truth.
The Raiders loss 0-52! That's sad.
I would be so upset if I was a Ravens fan.
This Ravens, Chargers game has been good since I've been watching it.
Green Bay vs Patriots is gonna be a good game. I'm not even gonna make a prediction.
I'm craving collard greens right now. Guess I should've taken some leftovers.
Dallas Cowboys feel free to pick up Ray Rice whenever he's available.
I might end up staying in bed all day. The thought of going outside is exhausting.
@RyallTopdog630 Oh ok.
@RyallTopdog630 I wanna get it but not until we upgrade to the Xbox 1. Is My Player mode better than 2k13? That's the 1 I'm still on.
@RyallTopdog630 Which 2k u playing?
Ok I'm done watching. Defense was real bullshit today. Now I gotta hear from bitch ass Eagles fans. #Thanks
I'm a real optimist.The game is nvr over to me til it says 0:00.
Can the d get a stop?
The Eagles dead serious whooping our ass smh. Fuck this game lol...but seriously.
They stopped the touchdown but 3 points adds up.
So I guess the defense just ain't gon play tonight. Smfh. Shit gotta change 2nd half.
I really need the Cowboys to win cause the Eagles fans will nvr shut the hell up other wise. #CowboysNation #LetsGoCowboys
I just need to make it through this day and I'm off until Monday!  #Excited
This whole Ferguson situation is sad. Didn't get justice so u destroy shit in ur own neighborhood. What does that solve?
Smh y the fuck r they stealing shit?  Smh. I honestly believe some ppl don't give a damn they just wanna steal &amp; burn shit.
I turned 2 Fox News just b/c I like 2 piss myself off sometimes &amp; they're gettin on President Obama for sending ppl to Mike Brown's funeral.
I definitely put on too many layers today. I'm HOT.
Beat the Eagles on Thursday and we back on top!
Woke up just in time to see that my Cowboys won! #CowboysNation
When was the last time u heard me call u sweet darling And when was the last time I heard u say hey baby... #CallMyName  -Avery Sunshine
They need to stop making TOY guns look REAL. What's the point? So u can act like u have a real gun &amp; potentially get shot for real?
I need the Titans to come out strong next half. Eagles lose, Cowboys win, my Sunday will be made.
That's bullshit the Cowboys play tonight. I'll be sleep or on my way.
Just remembered I only work 3 days this week!  #Happy #LifeIsGood
Clips vs Charron has potential to be a great match up ,but if Clips freestyled all 3 rounds like I'm reading he did,  that's disappointing.
I feel out of the battle rap loop right now. I had no idea Charlie Clips &amp; Charron were battling.
@fratboy44 not allegations &amp; maybe many other blacks do as well rather than believing whatever they hear.
@fratboy44 Comments he's made don't apply to ALL blacks so he doesn't talk shit about blacks just whoever it applies 2. I support FACTS...
@fratboy44 Ha ha! And the proof u have is...white women saying so?
Ooohh b/c the public has said he's guilty and now anyone that supports him is wrong for doing so!? Smh.
Why ppl so mad @ Faizon Love? There has been NO proof that Bill Cosby actually raped those women so y can't he stand in support of him?
@Tsu_Surf That was for a check.
Had to wipe the dust (literally) off my laptop so I can do some editing. Its been a while, but I'm motivated right now. #Writer
I'm in a creative yet lazy mood right now.

Listening to 'The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.' This album never gets old.
I'm curious 2 see what the reasoning 4 shooting that man was. I would think the 1st statement would clarify that.
I'm tired af. I'll be glad when this class ends.
I'm a miss those marathons of The Cosby Show. Guess I'll have to buy the DVD. It don't matter if u allegedly did something or not u guilty.

"Houston, we have a problem."
What?
"Never mind"
What's the problem?
"Nothing"
Please tell u…
struggle working for someone else. The struggles still there regardless.
When u count hrs spent compared to pay , but honestly I believe it'll be worth it. I would rather struggle working for myself than...
I can't wait til I'm able to open my own business. I read at 1st a lot of owners actually make less than minimum wage...

Days like this comfirm I need to relocate. #EastCoast #ColdWeather
The news said near record lows today. I made sure I bundled up.
I want some fruit. Preferably watermelon and mango.
That nap was really useless because I'm still tired.
Especially so many yrs later. This would have made perfect sense in the 80's. If u wanted to hurt his image then would have been a great tm.
The allegations could be true or they could be false. My thing is,  if u didn't go to law enforcement y the hell u going to the media?
So apparently Bill Cosby raped everybody in the 80's. Smh. Just b/c I hear it a thousand times doesn't make me believe it any more.
I'm in need of a nap like right now.
I can't wait for this semester to be over so I can start writing again. Or maybe I should just use the time I spend on Twitter writing...hmm
Bored at work already.
@HitmanHolla I never heard that and refuse to believe it about Stone Cold lol.
I'm craving pizza. The thin crust,extra greasy kind. Papa Johns won't do tonight.
All I want to do is go to bed but I have to take my son to the movies. #MomProblems
I fell asleep on the Aaliyah movie but based on the comments it didn't get any better.
Who <EYES> With me
The fact that Wendy Williams is involved with this Aaliyah movie makes me not want to watch it , but I may out of curiosity.
I don't know if it's true or not I just wonder why wait so long to speak publicly and what made her so now is the time.
I wonder what the motive of the woman that is coming out saying Bill Cosby raped her is. It happened 25 yrs ago, why come out now?
I think I really want to move to California.
Not showing up would probably be more satisfying. Imagine not feeling like getting out of bed and then saying Fuck it, I quit!
I often fantasize about quitting my job in the middle of my shift or just never showing back up to work.
I woke up in a I hate my job so I really need to get my shit together kinda mood.  #Motivated
I think I might actually write something for my blog today.
Woke up thinking about some b.s. I gotta let shit go lol.
FAV for no
#LakerNation 
No TRL, now no 106 &amp; Park. We really r in a diff time now. I remember wanting to see my fav artists&amp; watch my fav videos on those shows.
I don't believe a damn thing this man on Maury sayin. Talking bout he used 2 condoms! I don't believe anyone that says that shit.
TGIF!!!
4 hours of sleep...yeah that's all I need. #Sarcasm
I just need D.Rose to stay healthy. Got damn!
I really am not ready for snow!
@HarveyLevinTMZ Didn't Britney and Charlie meet in February?
I think I've seen Kim Kardashian's naked body enough for 1 day. Damn. No warnings on Twitter u just see boobs and vaginas.
Money can't buy everything.
It has been a long day. I think I'll take a nap.
@JazTheRapper Glad to know I'm not the only 20 something yr old that watches Family Feud.
@TMZTVSkype Ok when will this be?
@TMZTVSkype I want to but I would be nervous. TV is scary.
I hate ppl that think they're funny but they're not. I feel obligated to laugh.
"The greater the difficulty, the greater the glory."
I have 8.5/9 of the most attractive personality traits. I might be a tad jealous sometimes.
@workbxxxtch She can be frustrating lol. I'm just hoping the next 2 yrs will be filled with great performances but we'll see.
@workbxxxtch I don't know about that. The 1 thing I saw the interviewer submitted questions and some were approved while others weren't.
Not tired but I have to get up early so I guess I'll go to bed.
@workbxxxtch what's done is done. The contract has been signed. Supposedly recent shows have been good so hopefully that'll continue
@workbxxxtch we all need something to keep our minds off of things but yeah if ur hearts not in it 100 u should take a break but
@workbxxxtch I don't think they're making her. I think the relationship didn't work out &amp; the only thing she knew to do was perform.
@workbxxxtch her story. I like to think details r being saved for a book lol.
@workbxxxtch to be asked,  Oh yeah so how did u feel about losing custody of ur kids? There's a time &amp; place &amp; when it's time she'll tell
@workbxxxtch know ppl still want to ask about that. I don't think she cares b/c honestly in the middle of talking about lingerie who wants
@workbxxxtch FF was awful I can't watch those interviews but I've seen a lot of good 1's recently. I think they approve interviews b/c they
@workbxxxtch and she can go live happily out of the spotlight.
@workbxxxtch if he hadn't cheated. Performing is probably just something to keep her occupied now. Hopefully this relationship will last
@workbxxxtch I think she's alright though &amp; is perfectly normal away from the cameras. That's probably where she wants to be &amp; would be
@workbxxxtch at that moment. Since then there hasn't been an update and it would be nice to see 1 but maybe they don't see that as necessary
@workbxxxtch I agree but when For The Record came out I thought that was the purpose. It gave insight on how she felt about her situation

@workbxxxtch  maybe they feel as long as they know the truth who cares. As she said,  They can take everything away from u but they can nvr
@workbxxxtch  take away ur truth. As long as she knows her truth &amp; is content w/ it, thats all that matters really.
@workbxxxtch We always want to know everything but some ppl do just want to keep some things private. There will always b false stories so
And look where it's @.Middle America. Now its a tragedy, now it's so sad to see, the end of a class
#NowPlaying 'The Way I Am' by Eminem. Favorite song of his and it never gets old.
Does anybody make real shit anymore? I ask cause I'm not sure.
My Mavs r getting their asses whooped. That's fucked up.
As I'm sure u know, ppl w/ mental illness don't always make the best decisions on their own. Having someone to guide u isn't always bad.
@cjm_90 @workbxxxtch when u don't know the details some things can be hard to understand.
@cjm_90 @workbxxxtch as far as making personal decisions for all u know she could be ,just legally if her dad didnt agree he could say no
@cjm_90 @workbxxxtch mental illness is life long &amp; when u have that kind of money maybe u need someone watching over it always
@cjm_90 @workbxxxtch if u were her u would be self conscious too knowing the world watched u @ ur lowest point.
@cjm_90 @workbxxxtch Honestly how long ago was that? I think she's come a long way since then. She has good moments &amp; awkward ones but
@TMZ This doesn't make sense b/c he was at the show in February of this yr.
@JazTheRapper Lmao my bf thought that was u! I didn't think she looked like u but apparently so. He was like is that Jaz the Rapper. Ha!
Everything is so fake nowadays. Too many attention seekers.
@Dasani605 I feel ya pain.
I don't care about none a these bitches, none a these bitches...
I want to stay in bed since it's my day off but I have other work to do.
@breatheheavycom @britneyspears @CharlieEbersol So u didnt put any of the positive articles from reliable sources up but put this 1 up? Hmm.
No work tomorrow!!!

NEWLY ADDED! Charlie Clips vs Tay Roc Rematch battle lyrics 
I haven't done shit I told myself I was going to do smh. #LazySunday
Then GET OFF TWITTER &amp; get to work!
Tired of wishing for weekends and the end of my shift. #WishingMyLifeAway @

but DURING we rather pretend like we NOT! …
It took me a while to realize that. All I need to do is just enough to not be looked at as a bad worker.
If u don't get paid based on performance and u've been at the same job for yrs with no change in ur job title, no need to be a good worker.
Sometimes being a good worker doesn't get u shit but more work and greater expectations from ur boss.
I can hear the rain falling outside and would love nothing more than to be able to stay in bed. Ugh sometimes I hate being an adult.
This is just another obstacle but I'll get through it.
I hope the Redskins lose every game left this season for re injuring Romo's back lol.
Damn Cowboys lose and Eagles win so I have to hear from bullshit Eagles fans tomorrow smh.
#LetsGoCowboys !!!
@chillajones It's a really good movie just like all of Denzel's movies.
U don't know how much u mean to me. Whenever ur down, you know that u can lean on me. No matter the situation I'm gon hold u down.
Luckily it's only raining where I am
I hate that it's snowing some places already. It's only November 1st can't that wait til at least December?

I got 3 hrs of consecutive sleep...I'm sleep walking right now.
OKC is fucked!  No Durant or Westbrook. I'm wondering if they'll make the playoffs now.
@JazTheRapper There were other pics I saw. In 1 he said it was his last meal.
I'm mad I took a nap and now I can't sleep. I have to get up in 4 hrs smh.
I love Spike Lee's loyalty to his team.
#DALvsUTA  let's go Mavs!
Sports are so unpredictable. The Knicks got blown out by the Bulls last night but have a close game w/ the Cavs.
Why the hell when people's favorite sports teams win they destroy shit and fight?! It's senseless enough when they lose but they WON! Smh.
@Nunu_Nellz Potentially...I still watch Jaz and 40 for Jaz parts.I would watch again for Clips parts.
clips vs rex
jaz vs 40
@CHARLIECLIPS vs @hollowdadon HAS to be next!
T Rex got a little reaction round 1 and none after that and got sympathy claps from Charlie Clips...Damn. 3-0 Clips.
I see the Mavs doing big things this year! #Mffl
I was supposed to be at the Knicks vs Mavs game last yr and Dirk ended up making the game winning shot at the buzzer. I was heated.
I'm passed cause I was supposed to be at the Knicks vs Bulls game tomorrow smh. Watch it be an awesome game.
@O_Zone11 It's cool though cause as you said fans do out number you non supporters lol.
@O_Zone11 I got that but I was more responding to the parts about if u can get something free don't buy it and you hardly bought cds.
@O_Zone11 even once I'm established. If you work hard on something it's nice to know it's appreciated.
@O_Zone11 I'm just a believer in supporting others b/c I think of myself and how I would like to be supported when I'm just coming up &amp;
@O_Zone11 Didn't you say you were going to write a book? Lol. Aren't going to want someone to buy it.
"Mis education of lauryn Hill" @MsLaurynHill albums are classics
@RyallTopdog630 I don't mean it but I'll say congrats.
@RyallTopdog630 Somebody's happy this morning. Lol.
I'm going to bed. 21-10 Dallas that's my prediction.
That was some dumb shit. Like really. Why didn't he just go down smh.
I'm definitely not watching the whole game. I'm tired already smh.

@RyallTopdog630 Good morning. I can't wait to go 7-1 after beating ur Redskins lol.
Eagles 5-2. Will my Cowboys be 7-1 after tomorrow? I think so. #CowboysNation
This is kind of a bullshit game between the Cardinals and Eagles. I need more scoring. Preferably from the Cardinals.
@rapgrid Couture, 40 Barrs, Jaz the Rapper, Official, and Ms Fit/C3
@iMyVerse Good luck.
Listening to Eminem...The only person to ever do a song with him and have a better verse is Nicki Minaj.

FAV for Kobe Bryant 
@Logic413 Happy B Day and good luck.
Steve Nash needs to retire. I was hoping he would get a ring but maybe it's just not in the cards.
I'm NEVER sick so when I feel even a tad bit off I don't know how to deal. #ThisIsAwful #Day6  #LordHelpMe
Not feeling well &amp; I've been thinking too much and doing little else. #Unproductive #OverThinking #RecipeForDisaster
I gotta stop letting bullshit bother me.
At some point u need to not jump in these dudes face, sit back, say u hope he's the father, and be humble.
These women on Maury trip me out. They test like 5 dudes and then get mad at the 6th dude for having doubts. And always sooo sure smh.
@RyallTopdog630 Good morning and happy birthday!
#LetsGoCowboys #CowboysNation 6-1!?!
Favorite - New York Giants
#NFLSunday 
Not feeling good at ALL...ugh.
Usually I'm content staying home but I actually wanna do something fun tonight.
Thank God this work week will be over in a few mins. The short weeks are the longest.
#TGIF !

#NowPlaying 'This Can't Be Life'
@CHARLIECLIPS Hollow Da Don
FUUUCK! My whole screen shattered and it'll be $200 to replace it. #LessonLearned
I haven't been able to write in a while so tomorrow after work that's what I'll be doing.  #ImExcited
@Logic413 Charlie Clips Tay Rock
I hope D Rose stays healthy this year!  Dallas Mavericks vs Chicago Bulls that's what I wanna see in the NBA Finals.
@RyallTopdog630 I know the struggle lol.
@RyallTopdog630 That's admirable. #LoyalFan
I got caught in the rain now my hair is fucked smh. Of course I have somewhere to go.
@JazTheRapper 80's baby but the 90's raised me.
I can't believe Snoop Dogg and Iggy Azalea are really going back and forth with each other. How bored is Snoop? Smh.
I don't know if replacing a 9-5 with another 9-5 is really the beat thing to do when you don't want to work a 9-5. #TemporaryFix
Life is too short to be stuck at a job you hate...#ItReallyIs #TimeForChange
I need to stay busy so these 8 hrs will go by fast.
Sooo tired.
@RyallTopdog630 Yup.
@RyallTopdog630 U might as well say I don't either cause it's a struggle just for me to finish a wine cooler.
@RyallTopdog630 That's something I would do lol.
@HitmanHolla Try it and see.
@CHARLIECLIPS Yours or Tay Rock vs DNA

belief that someone or something is reliable, good, honest, effective, etc...
A nap would be awesome right now but I have other things to do.
My day off isn't relaxing at all but at least I'm being productive.
Fav no 
@RyallTopdog630 I won't argue with u on that. Lol.
@RyallTopdog630 That's a legit question that we'll have to wait til the end of the season to find out. Hopefully ur Redskins can win again.
@RyallTopdog630 Lol. The nxt loss they have we'll here about Romo being the worst QB but I believe they have a real chance this yr.
@RyallTopdog630 Enjoying all this positivity about my Cowboys lol.
I DO!! <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
The Giants look TERRIBLE right now.
Cowboys still have a lot to do but this is a great start!
Very proud of my Cowboys today. They were undoubtedly the underdogs but looked very good. This was the test &amp; they passed!  #CowboysNation
Interception!!!
Touchdown Cowboys!
Lord things r going bad quickly.
#LetsGoCowboys get this TD. They look pretty good so far.
I'm pissed off this damn Bengals vs Panthers game is still on!  Ugggh!
The Dolphins gotta be hurt right now.
Almost game time! #LetsGoCowboys #CowboysNation
@O_Zone11 U must not watch snapped lol. They'll do it.
Damn Kevin Durant gonna be out for 6-8 weeks. I hope injuries don't mess this season up.
I'm up waaay to early for a Sunday. Smh.
Remember, Hollywood's not America...
I need some new artists to listen to. Any suggestions? #Real #Artists #StoryTellers
@breatheheavycom @britneyspears She looked good!
@RyallTopdog630 I knoow!  Hopefully we'll do better than ur Redskins but it won't be easy.
@RyallTopdog630 Friday usual, watching Family Feud.
@RyallTopdog630 R.Kelly's 'R.' Not appropriate for an 7 or 8 yr old but that was my jam &amp; still is lol.
I never feel like being at work but today I reeally don't feel like being here. Ugh!
Russell Wilson is awesome! I'm gonna be pissed off at him when my Cowboys play the Seahawks.
@chillajones Believe him until I have proof that he's lying. The truth is bound to come out b/c men aren't good @ being sneaky.
@RyallTopdog630 Ha ha! Ur Redskins r up 2mrw let's see what they do.
@RyallTopdog630 How Bout Them Cowboys lol.
Cowboys are 4-1! I'll take that start! #CowboysNation
Can the Rams actually pull off the upset? I hope so.
Damn it looks like the Eagles r going to win again. As long as my Cowboys win I'll be good.
@RyallTopdog630 Lol.
@RyallTopdog630 Ha! I don't think the game is coming on where I live but you'll be hearing from me if the final score is in Cowboys favor!
"The Equalizer' is a great movie! I strongly recommend it. As usual Denzel Washington can do no wrong.
@RyallTopdog630 Dallas goes 4-1 today!
@O_Zone11 That's cool. I support up and comers so keep me posted. Hopefully if I support others they'll support me when the time comes.
@O_Zone11 What kind of books do you write?
@O_Zone11 Lol.
Nick Jonas is gonna be the Justin Timberlake of the Jonas Brothers. He's breaking out.

Featuring @Logic413 @IAmIntelligenz @TheKidDoms @tanaforeal RT 
Forgive...sounds good. Forget...I'm not sure I could. They say time heals everthing, but I'm still waiting. #ImNotReadyToMakeNice
I just cannot get up without hitting the snooze button 3 times smh.
I'm a be tired as hell in the morning smh. We'll see if I'm able to avoid that snooze button.
I really wish pics of nude ppl and/or ppl sucking dick/having sex wouldn't pop up on my TL. It's always at the worst time too. Smh.
I love and hate the snooze button at the same time.
My Cowboys look good so far. #CowboysNation
Touchdown Cowboys!
Not surprised to hear Charlie Clips 3-0'd Rex but that could be b/c I'm bias. I really don't get the hype about Rex anyway.
That's what I like to see. Interception Foles! #CowboysNation #EaglesHater
Interception! Woo hoo! Lol.

#SM4
Has Summer Madness 4 began yet?
@Logic413 Mine too.
People that get great joy from watching others fail are really  pathetic individuals  #MiseryLovesCompany #Losers #Haters
People would much rather see the negative than the positive.
@BattleRapOnly @DNA_GTFOH @TheRealTayRoc Lol. I'm just thinking of their last battles &amp; that makes it hard to choose.

Who Y'all Got.?? #SM4 #URLtv" I'M SERIOUSLY NOT SURE.
@BattleRapOnly @DNA_GTFOH @TheRealTayRoc Debatable.
I liked Good Charlotte and Simple Plan the most. #PopRock #Early2000s
Lifestyles of the rich and famous. They're always complaining, always complaining. #GoodCharlotte Pop-Rock was the shit back then.
I hate fake people.
I'm lmao @ Blackish. The fact that I like it makes me think it'll get cancelled. Nothing I like lasts.  For now I'll enjoy it.
I never get tired of 'Bridesmaids'. I seriously laugh every time I watch it.
@RyallTopdog630 I was about to say well damn. Lmao.
I'm so tired but glad I'm caught up in school. Now I have to help my son with homework. Ugh. #ReadyForBed
I haven't been excited for a tv series in a long time but I'm excited for Blackish. I hope it's good.
@RyallTopdog630 Lol.
@RyallTopdog630 Yeah maybe I'm on Twitter too much lol.
@RyallTopdog630 Ha ha. That was a lucky guess.
@RyallTopdog630 U watching LMN? Lol.
@RyallTopdog630 Not at all. It's worse b/c it's math smh.
@RyallTopdog630 Unfortunately trying to get through this school work.
I hate stupid convos early in the morning. Just say good morning and move on please. #ItsTooEarly
@BlizzyBlack Golden Grahams.

@1USEnt @ProphetMocmoud Thanks for sharing. I love music that has meaning.
Good luck to @COUTURE401  @OfficialRealRap on their battles. Couture should win easy but Official &amp; E Hart will be a good battle I'm sure.
@RyallTopdog630 I will most certainly be on ur side on Sunday.
@Rio_Stud @TMZ Yeah that's what I read and they could definitely refuse if they wanted to.
@Rio_Stud @TMZ That's  good but men still shouldn't be fighting women.
@TMZ Y the hell is a MAN fighting women? He may feel like a woman but he's still a man.
Both of Keri Hilson's albums were solid.
Why would u wanna change me, arrange me, is that what u call love? #ChangeMe @KeriHilson
@Tsu_Surf Smh. Terrible. U don't do that to ppl.
I want to be petty lol. It's just not in me. I have to focus on being petty or I'll forget about it.
I'm way too nice smh. I wish I would've handled that situation with the same pettiness they brought to me. #OhWell
@RyallTopdog630 Well my downfall is eating sweets and only THINKING about exercising lol.
