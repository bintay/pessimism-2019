- with all your heart
- with all your soul
- with all your strength
Decisions have regrets but this decision really killed a great chance of going somewhere in a game i love to play
I gave you the chance to tell me the truth and you lied right to my face#liar i cant stand liars and im at the point where i cant stand u
What happened?
@themanofsteel34 @TheBallBible all day
“@TheBallBible: I feel naked without a hat on.” @themanofsteel34 this is so you
I feel like shit
Dont think anything can ruin my day because the redsox just won the world series last night#RedSoxNation #BostonStrong #WorldSeries
Redsox are champions!!!!
3 outs
Great job ellsbury way to get back safely
Lackey gets out of it!!!
Come on lackey get out of this
Is there anyone in playoff history better with the bases loaded than shane victorino? I think not
Victorino with 5rbis #clutch
Victorino!!!! I love that guy
vvictorino wity bases loaded let's see what he does hopefully he repeats what he did last time or Homer's
@BaseballSerious I do #redsoxnation
Napnation
redsox just had a great inning now lackey comes out with a nice cushion and he is dealing already
Redsox have figured out the rookie michael wacha and they did it just in time #clutch
A little bit higher and ellsbury would have had a homer
I thought ellsbury just hit a homer that was close
Stephen drew!!!!!#clutch
John lackey is dealing tonight #clutch
Shane victorino comes through again for boston and gomes was almost out at home that was so close jim joyce made a good call thank u shane!!
I swear every wednesday classes feel ten times longer even though they are shorter
@themanofsteel34 @IamCaesarHaley yeah maybe not but it would still be awesome to be able to do it
@themanofsteel34 ik but i just wanna blame u haha i actually have no idea why they hurt
How does golden tate not even get fined for his celebration like yes u scored u dont have to wave at u defender for 20 yards
This pain of not having my pa or my grandpa wright is so strong i just want them back why did they have to go?
@themanofsteel34 @IamCaesarHaley why wouldnt u want both?
shoulders and neck are killing me i blame @themanofsteel34 you gave me this pain idk how u did i just wanna blame u hahaha
@themanofsteel34 @IamCaesarHaley u might want to get super-mans super powers first
Some people are just such egotistical maniacs i swear their head is going to explode
@themanofsteel34 @IntEngineerings @IamCaesarHaley hahaha all day bro the man of steel definitely needs his ice cubes hahaha
Somethings doesnt feel right about this#confused
I swear technology can fuck a lot of shit up
Lets go Boston redsox lets win this!!!!#BostonStrong

Dios es grande

Can u for just once do whats best for someone other than yourself arent u supposed to be a role model? Bc if u r then u r horrible at it
Six outs away from a trip to the world series #letsgo #WorldSeries #RedSox thank you shane victorino #hero
You are nothing but a prick always picking on ppl smaller than u who cant fight back well if u touch me u in for a rude awakening
This is all way to much
Pain is only temporary well sometimes the pain hurts so much that even the tho its only there for a little while it can still leave a mark
I miss my grandpa wright and my pa so much i wish u guys were still down here with me i love you guys RIP you are gone but never forgotten
The things sports can teach u is incredible bc of the different ways u have to think while playing sports its just wow i love sports
Rip to adrian petersons son cant believe this my prayers go out to the peterson family im so sorry for your loss

Fire works were pretty awesome
Congrats to homer bailey on getting another no hitter he has gotten the last two no hitters great pitcher congrats to him
Somebody didn't wake up this morning, but i did. 
I'm not lucky, I'm blessed.
I don't have a clue where I'm supposed to go from here
I can't do anything without thinking about you
Wow this girl is so amazing
Who the fuck are you to talk about me to someone else especially when u don't even fucking know me like that

They saw you scroll <BASEBALL>
No matter how tough life gets I will always love life bc ik there are going to difficult parts but once I get through it I will be stronger
I really wish I had a punching bag in my room it would be perfect for my mood right now
Where do I go from here?
I am done trying I don't see the point in it anymore no matter how hard I try nothing happens why bother trying if u don't even notice
Y do I even bother trying
And now I realized again all that effort I put in came with no results it's nothing like practicing sports bc u get results from trying then

Then 3 minutes later you realize you are staring directly at some…

Sometimes selfish like Mr. Crabs.

A bit dumb like Patrick.

But I'll be there for you like S…

@IamCaesarHaley @themanofsteel34 ikr I'm glad I found that little area bc now we can just workout there
@IamCaesarHaley yeah bro
@IamCaesarHaley @themanofsteel34 how much a family membership is
@themanofsteel34 yeah it might
@IamCaesarHaley @themanofsteel34 I know it is but I will ask my dad tomorrow or something
@IamCaesarHaley @themanofsteel34 to answer u question yes u can but I'm pretty sure it's like 150$ a month
@themanofsteel34 I am but I'm not because he bats before cargo so u kind of have to pitch to him
@themanofsteel34 yeah true
@themanofsteel34 in what factor that he puts the ball in play away from everyone yeah that was about miggy
@themanofsteel34 I hope he goes far with it he deserves a streak like this
@themanofsteel34 true that because he always puts the ball in the right spot it's so hard to get him out bc he hits the ball away
Michael cuddyer extends his hitting streak to 25 games I wonder how far he will get
@themanofsteel34 yeah ik but still the guy is like impossible to stop bc he doesn't try to crush the ball like Davis
@themanofsteel34 no definitely not and plus so he might beat Cabrera in homers by like 5 but Cabrera is killing him in ribs and average
@themanofsteel34 I agree like yes Chris Davis is smashing the ball out of the park but Miguel Cabrera Is a triple crown winner
I fell in love with your personality, your looks are just a bonus.
I'm so worried about you right now I hope what I'm thinking is wrong but I doubt i am wrong

@themanofsteel34 @IamCaesarHaley ik how u feel with the whole should have punched some people in the face u guys know what I'm talking bout
@themanofsteel34 I never really did I just like pissing u off and arguing with u about sports is way to much fun for me
@themanofsteel34 well u wanted to bash a team for no reason if the bruins would have one u wouldn't be bashing the Blackhawks bc they lost
@themanofsteel34 it doesn't matter both team worked their asses off to get there 1 team wins 1 loses this year your team lost deal with it
@themanofsteel34 I never said I did but I'm not sitting here bashing them I didn't say yes Blackhawks won did I no I said congrats stalberg
Ucla takes game 1 from Mississippi st I'm hoping for the upset but I doubt I get it but let's go Mississippi st!!!
@themanofsteel34 really? The bruins almost lost to the fucking maple leafs and they deserved to be there? They were up 3-0 dude
@themanofsteel34 why like u can say u hate them now bc they beat the bruins but why did u hate them coming into the cup
@themanofsteel34 u r just jealous bc the bruins lost if it wasn't the bruins who got beat u wouldn't give a shit
Chicago won the cup congrats victor stalberg can't believe I can say I watched a Stanley cup winner play in college #catamounts #blackhawks

It poured all last night but that's okay because I woke up at 8 to see the sun is shining so it looks like today is gonna be a good day
This storm is something
Can't even listen to most music because then I think of you
Sometimes I just go through my contacts and whenever I see u name I debate whether to text u or not but I always decide against texting u
I just wish u knew how much I miss u
@AirCongo10 so true man
Another hot day
@Calvvvviiiin_B thanks
@Calvvvviiiin_B don't think that's going to help with this problem
I really don't know what to do anymore #clueless

If we r tweeting bout each other then i have to say this u say u like me but it seems like u r always ignoring me
I really hope we r not tweeting about eachother without actually saying our names
If u r using me for something i hope u get it so karma can turn around and get u twice as bad
Sometimes i wonder if u really care about me or if it is all just a big act
@LaurenCim_1FAN yes yes she is
@LaurenCim_1FAN she is going to win ik it
@LaurenCim_1FAN gotta love her she better win x factor sara
I hate when i get to the point where i cant deal with my own shit
Really just want to be with you but i dont know how to tell u bc of everything and dont want it to ruin what we already have
I hate when i have the feeling of wanting to be with you when i know i cant
@AlanaAndrewz aww thanks alana u r a great friend
