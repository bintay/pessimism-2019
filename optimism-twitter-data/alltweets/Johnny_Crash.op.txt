England, I am disappoint. You elected a government out of fear, hate &amp; spite. #GE2015  
Farewell @Nigel_Farage #GE2015 #UKIP 


45-56 That's my number. #GE2015 #SNP #SNPout #YESScotland #NicolaSturgeon 

@LibDemDeposits is worth following. Remember when these fucking deceivers were the third largest party? #GE2015
@ChocolateChoux @Butsay_ He probably lives with his mum, sends rape threats to Mila Kunis and cries when he wanks.
I looked up #VoteLabourGetIslam. It's actually a recipe for cunt soup sprinkled with cretin croutons.
Exactly.  
@MsJackMonroe A Bloody Mary sounds great. You'll probably need something stronger but I don't think cocaine is Fair Trade.
@peachesanscream It was white, heterosexual, middle aged men. Much like now.....
@Daily_Record I saw that too: 
@Alice_Undrgrnd @DelenaMcCrary I did not suggest it. Oh God, I'll be an accessory! Please just buy a nice card!
@Alice_Undrgrnd @DelenaMcCrary I'm not suggesting you kill her.....
@NicolaSturgeon Good luck, break a leg, Macbeth etc.
@Alice_Undrgrnd @DelenaMcCrary Don't worry, it gets much easier and a lot less stressful when they're dead.
I'm an intellectual pygmy,a politically illiterate sex offender and I don't really like brown people. Which is #WhyImVotingUkip
@abnormalalan @UrbanOutfitters @TheEveningTimes @TSScot What.
@WingsScotland You'll eventually learn to love American Dad. Don't fight it.
@_Mozza_ @mein_crustacean I wish I was . Back to work on Monday....
@_Mozza_ I'd be happy with 45 but I'd rather have closer to 50. I'm going for 51 seats just to b optimistic.
Beer isn't going to be enough so I've had to get the Balvenie out. Hopefully this will work.
@tinytwink It's never easy but then, if their job was that important they'd take the advice and warnings seriously wouldn't they?
@tinytwink Wait until you have to decide whether to sack someone or not.
@_Mozza_ I might even learn to spell his name right....
@_Mozza_ John Snow is doing well so far though.
@stevebrookstein You asked the question, not me.
It's beer time. I need to be weakened by a savage hangover tomorrow so I don't turn on Tory or UKIP voters at the polling station. #GE2015
@stevebrookstein For Example: Me and Steven Hawking. I can understand theoretical physics about as well as he can dance.
Meanwhile the richest 1000 people have DOUBLED their wealth. The money IS there, it's where it's going that's wrong. 
Please vote. Otherwise we might end up with five more years of heartless, selfish, horrendous people in charge.  
Farewell Errol, you sexy thing. #ErrolBrown #RIP #HotChocolate
@scottishlabour @kdugdalemsp Only because you've been saying it. What did you think they'd do with that? Really?
@NeilMackay @TweakTweak29 Both of them?
@OwenJones84 I'd prefer it if Labour moved back to the left but until they do or the Greens refine their policies and mature....
@batteredbooks True. Perhaps bribery with sweets is a more realistic approach.
This is some good fucking news. Beaches are going to see some action this summer.  

#dadbod #fatandfit
@batteredbooks regale her with stories of heroism. Hinault in '80, Hampsten on the Gavia in '88 etc. Rules are for MAMILS and Sky blow-ins.
@SeanBattySTV @HumzaYousaf I hope a deep depression doesn't appear on Friday.
@AngrySalmond They're either insanely (literally) arrogant, utterly incompetent or are deliberately throwing the election.
@eddieizzard For someone so creative who campaigned vehemently on the side of fear, this seriously lacks imagination and self awareness.
@IrvineWelsh We should also privatise the royal family. If they bring in that much revenue, let them and then tax them.
@IrvineWelsh @antonnewcombe I hope so. I hope people don't go to the polling station and panic at the last minute.
@MsJackMonroe @ProteinWorld YES. Fantastic work. (Not you Protein World - you're a cretin.)
@scottreid1980 @_Mozza_ What exactly did Labour expect the Conservatives to do with that line? They handed it to them, the morons.
@CaitlinHunter5 Don't worry. When you do it's even more upsetting.
@WingsScotland @kdugdalemsp Politician in failing to keep promises shocker. Or perhaps she has investigated and thinks it's acceptable.
@hayleycampbelly It's one step up from no whisky at least.
@rickygervais Exactly. "Think of ALL the gods you don't believe in. I just believe in one less than you."
@AsEasyAsRiding @beztweets Even if I thought I'd hit a wheelie bin I'd stop. You wouldn't just leave it in the road..... WAC.
@akdelivers No problem. I don't have many followers but the more people that see it, the better.
@WeWantPlates @Tankian21 Is the next course a landing simulator?
@classicretro 15 years gone today and a good time to remember what an exceptional human being he was: 
@MisssyM @greghemphill69 It's certainly better than the parochial, insular &amp; isolated little Engerlund UKIP are proposing. I'm IN!
@plasmatron I believe it was called a 'disturbance' in the press.
@Tucker5law Some people aren't cunts, they're just inordinately stupid. And then there are the stupid cunts...
@SianCarstairs @WingsScotland *claws out own eyes*
@WingsScotland I don't begrudge anyone success but talk about pulling the ladder up behind you....
@euancx BTW, if you know anything or anyone who knows about the groupset/wheels, can you let me know? It's a total mystery so far.
@euancx 
@euancx 
@euancx Yeah - I couldn't pass this up. The frame, FiR gruppo &amp; Alpina hubs are mega rare. I'll add some photos...
New bike day! NOS 1995 Coppi. Columbus Genius / Dura Ace / FiR / Alpina / 3ttt. 
@IrvineWelsh @OrgTim I have him down as a nihilist.
A great article that shows who Labour are really working for....  
Charlotte? They named the #RoyalBaby after a fucking potato?
@deidhaul5 I noticed yesterday that all the Fuck Boys were wearing all black Huarrahes. They must phone each other to discuss it.
@Tucker5law I bet Jim's got a very upsetting erection right there. It'll probably end in a tearful visit to the toilets....
Eat your cereal.  
@Lynne_Currie @theSNP @NicolaSturgeon SNP are closer to traditional Labour values than Labour. With 'New' Labour they moved to the right.
Seriously: fuck off.  
@BoringOleFart @nataliemcgarry 
@SNPdavid @WingsScotland @jamesdoleman At least they've got into double figures. That's more than @JimForScotland can manage.
@BritishLogic Piss yourself to death within half an hour.
@BamfordDi @EtonOldBoys @Glaikitgit @jon_swindon @UKLabour Is that why in 13 years of power you failed to renationalise British Rail?
Six hours of looking at a fucking door. Is there no other news that could possibly be reported in the meantime? #RoyalBaby #RoyalBabyWatch
@mmcnallycycling @letouryorkshire @DimensionData Nice one! You worked bloody hard for it!
@EtonOldBoys I'm more offended by the attempt to insult our intelligence than anything else. They must be stupid to think nobody would know.
I voted for @mmcnallycycling to win the @DimensionData Digital jersey on Stage 2 of @LetourYorkshire ! #TdYvote 
@bethanjenkins If you remove 'tomato' from the sentence, the press will have a field day.
@rickygervais This rhino horn isn't working. Get me a shark's fin and some orangutan semen!
@Nigel_Farage Looking at the age profile, you've got to hope they've already sent in a postal vote. They might not make it to Thursday.
@roadcc That's going to be interesting.
Chapeau @alexdowsett / @Movistar_Team Smashed it, made history and now you're up there with the legends of cycling. That was a #PerfectHour
@alexdowsett Having time to tweet is just showing off.
@euancx I'm also watching to see if any start sliding down....
@JamieHolePunch @Tucker5law Another victim of 'the gush.' 
@Movistar_Team @alexdowsett Forza! Good luck!
@scottishlabour The millionaire, tax dodging Martin Freeman? What an endorsement.
@JimForScotland @scottishlabour Some of the poorest parts of Scotland have been Labour for DECADES. Why change now?
@Johnny_Crash Kay Burley is now fully erect.
@Johnny_Crash Already tumescent, Nicholas Witchell has leapt over the bed, smashed it in the face with an ashtray and got it under control.
It's a busy day! @suzie_richards wrecking some pros, @alexdowsett's #PerfectHour, #TourDeYorkshire and a #TourDeRomandie summit finish.
It's hatched and it's already eaten the mother. #RoyalBaby #RoyalBabyWatch #lizard
@plasmatron *strange.
@plasmatron This isn't just any strane baby. It's being born into a world of ludicrous wealth and privilege and it might rule over US ALL.
It's hatching. This is the end, save yourselves. #RoyalBaby #RoyalBabyWatch #lizard 
@SubClub @danielmarkavery @BarntWorlds @theiamUK That's a sore one to be missing.
@millarmind and @nedboulting's commentary today was excellent. The insights and knowledge really made it interesting. #TourDeYorkshire
@thepuncheur It's the end times. Save yourselves.
@AngrySalmond He's a wit himself. Well, at least half of one.
Sad to see Marcel Kittel climb off so early. I hope he recovers form soon - he's great to watch in full flight.  #TourDeYorkshire
@Doctor_Hutch Madness, and quite a large failure by someone (and the drivers!)
@letouryorkshire twitter updates have room for improvement.... Thankfully, the coverage has started on ITV4 now. #TourDeYorkshire Forza!
@kiltedlad1983 @Yayymes @JimForScotland @WingsScotland Is this real life? Treating potential voters as if they're stupid isn't helping.
@NorthBarDrinks Fosters please. 

Just kidding - @MagicRockBrewCo Cannonball please! Lots and lots of Cannonball.
@DaftLimmy It looks like he's had a rough night with a few sailors.
Possibly the most sinister thing I've heard him say yet.... #bbcqt 
@Johnny_Crash At least that's me fully prepared for the #bbcqt Leaders Special...
@naebD @_Mozza_ @Tigers2iron You're right. I apologise. It was low blow.
@Tucker5law @JumMurphy Unless it was a game where you don't answer a single  question. If so, he's nailed it. He's world champion.
@Johnny_Crash He's on again. I can fucking hear him. Rams knitting needles into ears.
@Tigers2iron @naebD @_Mozza_ You're certainly more self aware than ScotLab are, I'll give you that.
@naebD @_Mozza_ The best thing about this is the juxtaposition of @Tigers2iron's profile picture and his banner picture.
@GML1320 @_Mozza_ Just looking at his feed you can tell he's not particularly bright. That's a real bottom of the barrel candidate.
Nigel Farage on TV? Sicks on own cock and sets fire to eyes.
@AngrySalmond @dhothersall The levels of desperation emanating from ScotLab are amusing, amazing and utterly depressing in equal measure.
@dhothersall Insulting the voters you need to win back? You might as well just get the white flag up if that's your strategy now.
If Scottish Labour were a dog, you'd just shoot it instead of having it wander round blind, growling, covered in it's own shit &amp; moribund.
@sturdyAlex Solid work.
Super nice work again from @Restrap 
Yes please!  
@MARAVALV @Rubberbandits - This is pretty Gas Cuntist isn't it?
@rickygervais Really bucking the trend being pictured with a happy, live animal.
@plasmatron @DaftLimmy It's really fucking odd isn't it?
@tinytwink I never check. I just pretend everything's okay.
@KylieHamps Herpes?
@weegingerdug @WingsScotland @AngryWeegie @PlentyD @ojedge @Celebs4indy We named 500 paedophiles and named 500 more. The Defamers.
@williamsonkev Considering the current UK deficit, it's a £15bn improvement immediately. That seems pretty good to me.
@michaellegge @NivenJ1 It's Return of Cobain I'm looking forward to most.
@M_Stanley @CTC_Cyclists @WestYorksPolice @WYP_RPU That is unbelievable. The police are a disappointment and a disgrace if that's the case.
@Nigel_Farage That's nonsense. We just know an arsehole when we see one.
I've signed @theSNP's #WomenPledge... Join me!#activeSNP #GE15 
@CaitlinHunter5 Mine too - I was in tears by the end. 
It seemed really long and I just wanted a beer.
@tinytwink @VodafoneUKhelp Riot.
@antonnewcombe They're just complete failures as human beings. Not because they're rich, because they're horrible cunts.
@JimForScotland @CarolineFlintMP Drawing a big crowd there.
@peachesanscream I'm not sure feral cats are concerned with infant sacrifice.
@roadhawk_uk @classicretro @VeloVixenUK @_julietelliott  I recommend as many people as possible watch this : 
"It's a shame about Keith Harris."
Me: "Dead or paedophile?"
Four In A Bed should just be called 'Pube Hunt.'
@Rubberbandits It's a parody blog but let's face it, it may as well be true.
The finest delivery service in the North(ern hemisphere.) #LeedsBicycleMessenger 
@abnormalalan @KeithHaringFdn It was nice to see it and be reminded anyway. :)
@DaftLimmy Fuck sake. I need to take her back out the Gary Glitter and Michael Jackson section of my record collection now.
There's crumbs in my butter. #WorstCrisisSinceAbdication
@plasmatron Daily Mail headline about an SNP/Lab coalition.
A fish slice jamming the middle drawer shut and fucking about with a chopstick for an hour to get it open again. #WorstCrisisSinceAbdication
That wee flap on packets of bacon that make you think you can open it without a knife when you FUCKING can't. #WorstCrisisSinceAbdication
Brushed my teeth and still have some orange juice left. #WorstCrisisSinceAbdication
@Tucker5law @WingsScotland SNP Vow To Work With North Korea and The Kremlim to Topple Queen.
@HumzaYousaf @hendopolis You all must be delighted that this and Dollgate are all they've got!
@abnormalalan Wasn't Keith Haring born on May 4th?
@Butsay_ 0.59 though. People feel cheated with 0.8.
I see the media/BBC have learned as much as Labour did from last September. Making the same mistakes and doing all the work for the SNP.
@deidhaul5 If you can't have fun, when can you?
@WingsScotland @KatieKhaleesi That is a fascinating insight into how someone's mind works. Equate everything to rape? Aye, fine.....
@JoeLewis1989 @AmourDeVelo They'd be a lot less popular if they were called 'alonies.'
@BlackSailsUK We can get on with the learning when someone works out how to put something other than porn and pictures of cats on the 'net.
Fuck sake. Can we just tell men not to rape?  
I get insomnia so this is a mix I made of what I listen to. It's not 'easy listening,' but it is for me: 
Nice to see David Cameron @Conservatives get mauled by a few teenagers on BBC 1. Well done everyone.
@Butsay_ Just Googled her. She's not my thing. 
@Butsay_ Never heard of her. Carry on listening.
@plasmatron @OwenJones84 @Celticsleftwing That's a bingo as they say.
@tontononstompo They all want to keep SNP/Plaid or any non neoliberal party out. Labour have moved so far to the right it's all the same.
@tontononstompo Fucking hell. I wouldn't rule out a grand Labour/Tory coalition at this point.
@generallucifer Good idea! I'm also a fan of the Bacon Fry / Cheese Moments combo.
@generallucifer I'm also currently at that crossroads. Masterchef is on so I'll probably have some Scampi Fries.
@jazzmotronic It's when it arrives with two spoons and you realise you've accidentally ordered a sharing one.
@WeWantPlates @MikeyBramble That Hell hole requires to be named, shamed and then set on fire. My BP would be sky high if I was served that.
@NivenJ1 It certainly shines a light on how un-rock &amp; roll Coldplay are.
@antonnewcombe Looking at some politicians, I assumed this had already been done.
@generallucifer I hope he sneezes so hard a bit of wee escapes and soaks through his beige trousers. Or a bit of poo comes out.
@MailOnline It's lucky he was already dead.
@scottishlabour @STVNews Is that why your party has voter for and pledged to continue with austerity measures?
Lassie in a Massey. The news is really great today.
@Johnny_Crash Don't forget, if you do have health concerns, always consult your local magnetic therapist. Magnetic The Rapist.
In today's news: 

'Gibson said she had been “wrongly” diagnosed with cancers by a German magnetic therapist...' 
@Johnny_Crash 
Register to vote today and give more power to yourself:


@plasmatron Unbelievable.
@_Mozza_ @BradenDavy I don't know why they bother when five minutes of research can usually find out the facts. It's just insulting.
If @scottishlabour  &amp; @kdugdalemsp treat people as if they're stupid, it's not surprising they're losing voters. 
@deidhaul5 Although to be fair, I'd look like someone's handicapped little brother next to Wood &amp; Sturgeon. Well, like Farage really...
@deidhaul5 There's people in the Green Party who are much better orators and would probably shine in a debate like this. Caroline Lucas?
@deidhaul5 Scottish greens are much better. I just think Bennett is out of her depth when compared to the others.
@LODragunoff Fuck off you dog fucking sex offender.
@deidhaul5 I'm just watching now too. Leanne Wood and Nicola Sturgeon are phenomenal. Natalie Bennett not so much sadly. Farage is a clown.
@JimForScotland 2/10. Would not read again, would not recommend, would not vote for. That has missed the mark by miles.
Britain's Got Paedophiles. That roller skating Richard Wilson needs investigating.
#BGT Fuck me, it looks like Debbie Harry has fallen on hard times.
It's clear from the #leadersdebate  that Nigel Farage is a conceptual artist, pushing his creation to the very boundaries of ridiculousness.
Women of the world take over
Cause if you don't the world will come to an end
And it won't take long

@LeanneWood @NicolaSturgeon @Plaid_Cymru Two of the most honorable people in politics. By miles.
@EtonOldBoys @beevor52 His 'fucking memory' is clearly worse than his money memory.
@beevor52 @EtonOldBoys *his. Perhaps I have spelling dementia. If paedophile dementia is a 'thing' I'm sure it's possible.
@beevor52 @EtonOldBoys He seemed to have a very good memory when it came to claiming hes expenses.....
@mrchrisaddison Exactly. If you don't at least turn up, nobody knows if it's a protest or apathy and it usually gets counted as apathy.
@Fletch_Butcher @CTC_Cyclists @bikesnobnyc We're at this again? Christ.
@CTC_Cyclists @bikesnobnyc Presumed liability and the proper enforcement of traffic laws are what will really make a difference.
@CTC_Cyclists @bikesnobnyc The common factor in cyclists deaths and injuries isn't helmets, lights or high viz, it's HGVs, buses &amp; cars.
@chibbed @emmastewarttttt Looks fine to me. Not the worst I've had: 
#firstdates 
Watching Masterchef, eating crisps for dinner. #FML
@HillyFoz Poor things.
@HillyFoz Subjected to the sad mating calls of the lesser spotted onanist?
@generallucifer Don't stop now just in case you remember!
@Tucker5law This secret paedophile ring is getting out of hand. Are they're employing the kids to shut them up now?
@timothypulleyn @RestrapLTD @woodrupcycles @BespokedUKHBS I can't wait to see this! Don't whip skid it, eh?
@RevRichardColes I have to buy it for people at work. I usually end up blurting out 'it's not for me' at the checkout.
@NorrieHarman That's brilliant!
@deidhaul5 Holding your piss to ransom inside your own body is a fuckers trick.
@deidhaul5 I think the pub or Burger King has toilets that are free. Still, I've been like that &amp; couldn't think, almost tearful.
What does it mean when your teeth are falling out?
@AngrySalmond Willie Rennie just looks confused. Like Roger Hammond after that bang on the head.
@Butsay_ Also, I've just found his FB profile. He's got an ugly family and a shit kitchen. Top lols.
@Butsay_ With a potato who spends his time wanking off in the back bedroom of his mum's house?
@VansPorns Getting these back out for summer:

@Benfogle @xhjsb That 14 y/o girl at an empty, falling about, pretending to be drunk that ends up crying on the stairs with one shoe....
@Butsay_ Yeah, sorry (again.) Cake?
@iConnology @Butsay_ I tweet in my accent. I'm not sure why it's such a problem.
@Butsay_ This is (V)NSFW but is exactly whu I can't be offered cake without cracking up:

@bethanjenkins Obviously by 'favourite' I mean 'agree.'
Synopsis of last night.... 
Rothermere would be proud.  
Fuck off @UKLabour. £8 minimum wage by 2019 is pathetic. The living wage NOW is £9.15 in London you patronising chumps.
#ParisRoubaix Degenkolb spreads his cheeks and shits all over the hopes and dreams of all those behind him. Amazing ride, strong sprint.
@varunspike That would be awful Everyone is probably on 28c today though.
#ParisRoubaix I guess if you survive the cobbles, getting hit by a train seems like a holiday. The demented fuckers.
#ParisRoubaix   Eurosport calling Archery 'the ultimate sporting challenge' in the P-R adverts can fuck off to fuck.
@BillNorAngus @Cyril_Matvech Unless the Greens are there, it's always going to be unbalanced but the chair was abysmal. Unless on purpose...
@Johnny_Crash If you think that was 'debate' you need to get out of the playground/grow up. I wouldn't want to see anyone treated that way.
Gordon Brewer should be sacked for that. He didn't just lose control of the debate, he was instrumental in the bullying. #sunpolscot
#sunpolscot I was expecting it to be a little one sided but you might as well just be punching @NicolaSturgeon at this point. Pathetic.
@Johnny_Crash de Rooy not hesitating for a second: “Sure, it’s the most beautiful race in the world!
That's the fucking spirit.
@Johnny_Crash John Tesh, interviewing him for CBS: “Will you ever ride it again?”
@Johnny_Crash "...you’re slipping, it’s a piece of shit…” Said Theo de Rooy after crashing out in the 1985 Paris - Roubaix.
“It’s a bollocks this race! You’re working like an animal, you don’t have time to piss, you wet your pants. You’re riding in mud like this..
@NeilMackay @TweakTweak29 @bnolan1872 They all look pretty happy to me. I'd vote for that!
@deidhaul5 He did steal that tune from Jorge Ben though. 
Selfies would be a lot less popular if you called them what they actually are: alonies.
#GoFuckYourSelfie
@hayleycampbelly It's sunny?
Good luck to all the horses running in the Grand National today.  #breakaleg 
#GrandNational
@WyattVW @raceacrossitaly Good luck Wyatt! I hope it goers well. :)
@WingsScotland Of course but I'm sure someone will come along with something about traitors/treason shortly anyway.
@WingsScotland Can we also stop talking about treason please?
It's a nice fucking day and I'm feeling fucking good.
@LyndsayBurtonsh Well, that's cleared all this election nonsense up for me.
@1ofthe45plus @IrvineWelsh Willie Rennie got 1? As much as that?
@deidhaul5 *if. That debate sapped most of the life (and typing skills) out of me.
@deidhaul5 Perhaps of your parents are paying them and still buying you a Macbook and an Audi A1 they're not much of a concern?
@Margaret_Curran @JimForScotland If you think that was a winning performance, Labour is Scotland is moribund.
@deidhaul5 How do you become so sociopathically heartless, cynical and selfish at such a young age?
@NicolaSturgeon Certainly giving a good account of herself and the #SNP  
@frankieboyle I'm surprised it didn't throw itself out the window.
@deidhaul5 I thought it was Johann Lamont in the hat and 'tache.
Jim Murphy's like a third division football team - lots of shite set pieces. #ScotDebates
Has Willie Rennie stopped talking yet? #ScotDebates
#ScotDebates Where have they got this audience from? What kind of selection process did they go through to get this lot?
@NorrieHarman Pinocchio feet.
@AngrySalmond He's probably drinking a bottle of gin in the toilets and can't be found.
@Johnny_Crash In other news: 
@kdugdalemsp If you consider that 'strong' your party is in more trouble than I thought. #ScotDebates.
I suppose that more nukes is a sure fire way to eventually have no nukes. Or anything else for that matter.  #ScotDebates
Jim Murphy makes me want to be sick on my own cock. #ScotDebates
@plasmatron That's the star of the show so far.
@NorrieHarman He looks like he's getting protected by Westminster.
@kdugdalemsp @JimForScotland Peak/=peek. I do hope you're planning on debating education tonight.
@WingsScotland @theSNP @kdugdalemsp Labour have just made the same mistake. I hope education is debated tonight.
@jazzmotronic Don't forget that if meat eaters ask where you get your protein/iron etc from, first ask where they get their magnesium from.
Another life milestone reached. It turns out I'm the same age as Homer Simpson. How the fuck does that happen?
@Nigel_Farage 
@seangillies Lunch?
@seangillies It's 1245....
@seangillies I had Thai green curry.
@joe_duck Are you coming to watch? You can sit in the pub looking like a hard, flahute boss.
@BritishLogic I went to Cafe Nero today with my reusable Costa cup, told them to wash the Starbucks out of it first. I got tutted at. #UK
@alice_wible I did have a quick game of 'paedophile or grandad' which helped pass some time. (No definitive answer was derived.)
@Johnny_Crash  Once he's managed that I wish he'd get to grips with a one way ticket to Switzerland.
....and now, the oldest man in the world is trying to get to grips with chip and pin for the first time.
@alice_wible I'm not having a great time to be honest....
You're buying ONE item. Why not count the coppers and 5 p pieces out of your fucking purse whilst waiting in the fucking queue?
If you spent as much time choosing your partners as you do your fucking tomatoes, your kids wouldn't be such little shits. #shopping
Fuck's sake. It's a shopping trolley FULL of discounted bread - you're not pushing Steven Hawking through a fucking minefield. Move along!
@Tucker5law @WingsScotland I think it should be rolled out to more of them. Stat.
Hangover Level: Dignitas.
@hotgemMGMT 
@kkitsch Shit!
@kkitsch I've been listening to Ex Hex a bit too. They sound a bit like the Bangles (and I love the Bangles!) 
@kkitsch That sounds ace. Exmilitary was brilliant! I quite like the new Kendrick Lamar and Bill Wells/Aiden Moffat.
@kkitsch Not yet! Any good?
@kkitsch *Sings* 'And now he's in me, always with me, tiny gangsta in my car.'
@joe_duck And, I'm feeling like a social dynamo if Sam's chat is anything to go by.
@joe_duck Yeah, it wasn't worth a new tweet on its own.
@Johnny_Crash That Gloria is hard work. What a rude boot.
I wonder what kind of sex offenders and social ineptitude we're going to get on #firstdates tonight.
@KylieHamps You're supposed to think outside the box - it's once you're inside that you need help.
@mein_crustacean I'm not sure I can string it out that long. I'll probably get a ticket just in case though.
@mein_crustacean I do but it depends on shoulder/work. The way it's going now, I'll be back at work then.
@alice_wible Definitely!
@alice_wible I'm also watching Masterchef and waiting for dinner to cook. (I'm eating Daim mini eggs in the meantime.)
@alice_wible Excellent. I'm just about to open a bottle myself. Cheers!
@alice_wible Well, if it was for motivational purposes, I guess that's okay.
@alice_wible I think that's worse because you're patently not a cunt.10/10 for profanity though.
@tontononstompo No. I'm in Leeds (doing missionary work.)
I feel like I've made a mistake by not going into town to call Gideon Osbourne a cunt today. I hope he's still here tomorrow. #regrets
@missprofanity It was very difficult to masturbate to. Would not use again, would not recommend. 1/10
@mein_crustacean Annoying, isn't it?
@mein_crustacean Back to the physio on the 14th and then the consultant on the 20th to find out how it's all going. Back on the bike ASAP!
@mein_crustacean Started physio and shoulder feels a lot better. Cycled a little but takeaways and beer have taken their toll on fitness.
@mein_crustacean Definitely! They only victim of the fire was a tea towel so we all did quite well!
@_Mozza_ @mein_crustacean ON THE FIRE!
@akdelivers Congratulations!
@scottishlabour @JimForScotland It'd be a lot easier to swim without your hand on my head.
@seangillies Or this? 
@seangillies How's this? 
Brass Eye managed to predict the future regarding paedophiles so any one of these jokes might as well be true or are as likely to come true.
The world has got so fucking bizarre, it's like living in a permanent April Fools day. Today was no different to any other day news wise.
@stephenwitt @NivenJ1 "My mom, my dad *cries a bit* ...... God."
@WeWantPlates @MorganLeahy Was that food stabbed at one end and tried to crawl across the board to get help?
@timothypulleyn Good work Tim. I'm very happy you're not dead!
B&amp;Q closing 60 stores after promising jobs would ONLY be safe with a no vote. How many companies were planning to use 'Yes' as an excuse?
@Johnny_Crash And he fucked up Fargo by being a fucking hobbit who can't do a decent impersonation of William H. Macy. The dog fucker.
@jazzmotronic The Scottish national anthem being sung 'proudly' by no voters?
I've fallen out with Martin Freeman - either that's an Oscar winning performance, he doesn't understand politics or he's a liar.
@beztweets The first paragraph pretty much nails it anyway.
@beztweets I hope you find the energy to finish it. Having similar discussions across the internet now....
Less than £300 to try and raise for @CR_UK if you could help? :) xx

@JCAM_01 @David_Cameron I have a special hatred for him. If I get started I'll likely get arrested for cyber-bullying.
Fuck off winter, you've had your turn.
@WyattVW @KTHopkins If she didn't exist, nobody would invent her. No use to the progress of mankind.
@antonnewcombe @guardian Can the BBC only survive by employing braying, boorish, violent, racist bullies?
@Cyclingnewsfeed @tinkoff_saxo Jeremy Clarkson would be ideal. He loves sitting in cars shouting at foreigners and cyclists.
@peachesanscream Free cocktails!
@LiamUTLR @deidhaul5 They should be made to stand separately and sing a song about Culloden or something. Then get boo'd for five minutes.
@LiamUTLR @deidhaul5 It's baffling watching all these demented no voters singing about Bannockburn at sporting events.
Paolini! Crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentations of their directeurs.#GWE @katushacycling
Fuck me. Ypres hasn't seen battling this fierce since 1917.
@timothypulleyn He did get a LOT of help from the car but it was still pretty impressive!
@DaftLimmy @jazzmotronic Wistfully dreams of being breastfed by Thatcher.
@Johnny_Crash Obviously, I'm against the death penalty but at least they're taking a stand.
@timothypulleyn 
@Johnny_Crash It's being literally blown apart by the wind. Five groups, Wiggins climbed off, Cav dropped, Sagan riding at 70° to stay up.
Gent Wevelgem is fucking kicking off! No can hold a line and Steegmans has been blown into the canal by the wind! 
@IrvineWelsh Westminster isn't Scotland either and an inch is as good as a mile as they say.
@timothypulleyn @wigglebikeshop @DeuxNorth I wonder what @AnaGlowinski might think of this. Once, an accident, twice? Other dhb kits?
@Shequeen @WingsScotland Running is undignified. You should only run to escape cops and ONLY after you've tried to talk your way out of it.
@danthompson78 You don't need it. Confusingly, you would say it in speech but not write it.
@roadcc And developing a framework where drivers are actually punished for failing to drive safely?
@roadcc How about developing driving standards so drivers pay attention?
Why aren't people with mental health issues standing up and apologising en masse for GermanWings? (Or does that only work if you're Muslim?)
@IrvineWelsh @plasmatron @OwenJones84 Graham Norton is my co-pilot.
@mein_crustacean In which case you're morally reprehensible, should really be taking a long hard look at yourself and embracing Jesus.
@rawtofu @bikesnobnyc Also pedestrians. Behind motor accidents, 'unintentional falls' account for 30,000 deaths per year. (Cyclists=700 p/a)
Two guys and a girl is NOT a threesome. If it's anything, it's a halfsome.
@NivenJ1 Does that mean you're driving?
@HumzaYousaf @theSNP Good luck, break a leg, Macbeth etc!
@Captain_Bhangra If these people didn't exist, I wouldn't invent them. #TeamCaptainBhangra
@Captain_Bhangra @WingsScotland @thelightleeds I hope he goes home, stands on a plug, causing him to fall down the stairs and break his cock
Wearing a pale grey t-shirt to go cycling in. Might as well have a huge golf sale sign saying "SWEATY BASTARD" above my head.
@bella_jonasss You can choose to end it any time you like.
@nee_massey @plasmatron Sometimes, differences in culture and music should just be celebrated unless we want a big bland soup of everything.
@Johnny_Crash That's three in the last 24 hours and not a mention. Are they just going to pretend it's not happening?
@hayleycampbelly Prizes on the new Family Fortunes?
@DavidMcMonagle "Unexpected item in bagging area" IT'S A FUCKING APPLE.
@DavidMcMonagle I always bring my own bag. (Unless I need some pedal bin liners.)
@Johnny_Crash An APPLE. It's a FUCKING APPLE.
IT IS IN THE FUCKING BAGGING AREA.
@Aidan_Kerr1 @IrvineWelsh We should have had the vote in early 2015 - a decent cold snap and we'd be enjoying an independent Scotland soon.
@StormySturgeon Everyone who signed the Clarkson &amp; Kanye petitions to be added to a National Arsehole Register.
@Johnny_Crash *When it's the same person, winning the same seat on the same policies with fewer votes than before.
The press go mad for a UKIP* victory in a by-election but haven't even mentioned the SNP landslide in Scotland....
@tontononstompo We'll use them in the future, when I'm in charge. as a kind of arsehole register.
Well, @LeanneWood did a fantastic job on #bbcqt tonight despite being outnumbered five to one. Very impressive.
@AidanJohnMoffat Aye, if he'd fucked kids they might have covered it up...
@Johnny_Crash What kind of fucking question was that anyway? The posh Clarkson apologist probably fucks foxes. Then eats them.
Jeremy Clarkson isn't a valid topic for QT despite being a dog fucker like the rest of them (except Leanne Wood.)
Jim Murphy might as well be talking about how he likes to fuck kids. That;s how good his jokes are.
@tontononstompo No social awareness, an all conquering sense of self importance are two well know Tory traits.
Why do these dog fuckers (not Leanne) insist the SNP are a threat? What happened to 'better together.' Or is that resources not ideas?
These dog fuckers (not you Leanne, you're ace) need to keep up. Alex Salmond isn't the leader of the SNP.
@_Mozza_ The guy deflected that very well!
@deidhaul5 Didn't you do this last week? I went out and bought skittles and everything.
@deidhaul5 I'm drinking through it. And eating crisps.
@PhantomLard @tinytwink My coat made from toe nail clippings is wearing out...
After careful consideration I have come to the conclusion that, apart from Leanne Wood, they're all a bunch of dog fuckers on Question Time.
@KevinColeman_7 @deidhaul5 Revolution! Riot!
@KevinColeman_7 @deidhaul5 Aye, he's happy to take the oil money though.
@Johnny_Crash That's anxiety, not a Jim Murphy joke btw.
I'm not sure I can cope with Question Time after that. It's all a bit much. 
*Breathes into paper bag* *Drinks whisky* *Breathes into bag*
@Tucker5law @AngrySalmond Balvenie. I had to have a drink during the last show.
@Tucker5law @AngrySalmond I'd die within five minutes (but set a new world record for the amount of Bavenie drunk in the same period.)
@_Mozza_ Here he goes.
@_Mozza_ He never comes across well but I think he's a LOT stronger than he's given credit for. David/Unions/Daily Mail/Syria etc.
@fyfeywifey1 @HumzaYousaf More like getting shanked in the throat in a prison shower or burnt to death in a Travelodge bathroom.
@_Mozza_ I do admire how Ed stands up for himself. For example, If it wasn't for him, we'd be at war now.... Supporting ISIS.
#BattleForNumber10 Kay Burley's bias was showing there. (Not a euphemism.)
@AidanJohnMoffat When I get round to buying it (Tuesday) I'll send a wee tweet. I enjoyed the launch party so I'm sure it won't be shite.
@Johnny_Crash Although he's probably hoping the audience have been picked as carefully for him as they were for Dave.
Ed Miliband's probably on the phone to his mum begging for a note to get out of doing this now.
@_Mozza_ I was nearly weeping....
@_Mozza_ An English, catholic king being described as British and buried in Leicester Cathedral? I'm confused to say the least.
"How much money have you borrowed?" 
Answer the fucking question Cameron.
@Johnny_Crash Go Paxman.
@missprofanity Cameron has nearly given me a fucking aneurysm already. I hope Paxman gives him a hard time.
The Battle For Number 10. I'm fucking furious already. People don't give a fuck about the economy when they're starving and freezing.
@Johnny_Crash Got Skittles, Tyrells, Digestives and Thornton's Caramel Shortcake. Sorted for diabetes and increased risk of heart disease.
@Scarfolk Scarfolk V's Reality:


@AngrySalmond I think they're debating in a c*nt trap. They've just caught Farage.....
Need to get some snacks in for the Leaders Q&amp;A and Question Time. Any suggestions considered.
@PhantomLard @tinytwink I'm only putting up with it until I've got enough for a nice coat.
@roadcc "The Collector" is well known for having replicas of famous and rare bicycles.
@bikesnobnyc What helmet advocates fail to mention is that more lives would be saved if car drivers wore helmets than if cyclists wore them.
@deidaul5 The holy trinity. I've been boycotting Tunnock's since they threatened their staff to vote No otherwise there'd be a wee teacake.
@deidhaul5 How's this? 
@tinytwink I do this too. I put up pictures of cute cats on lost posters. I have 23 now.
@stevebrookstein Wow. I hope you never have to suffer from depression. It's like saying a broken leg is imaginary so just run it off.
@deidhaul5 If it is, they should be put on a register so when I'm king of the world, we can sort them out. See also: Clarkson petition.
@deidhaul5 Is this real life?
@tinytwink So, that's someone else to hate and I've just looked at his page - he's not very bright is he?
@ctznsmith @timothypulleyn @jessicabateman Because we don't really have a single constitution. A lot of it's 'unwritten' so they make it up.
@jessicabateman @timothypulleyn And in a beautiful display of irony, Govt. are considering appealing in the European Court of Human Rights.
@RevRichardColes Reminds me of the tramp interview on TV re: eating hedgehogs. "What do they taste like?" Man thinks,,,,,, "A bit like cat."
@RogerHelmerMEP I genuinely struggle to believe this isn't a parody account.... Think of the energy your own hot air could produce.
@missprofanity Imagine if they were alive when Bouncer died? Like lemmings, they'd be casting themselves and their broken hearts off cliffs.
@scottishlass51 @IrvineWelsh That sums up my thoughts exactly. I'm still disappointed of course.
@jeurmay The producer that got assaulted and then DIDN'T report it? Well, the average IQ of BBC watchers has obviously risen considerably...
@jeurmay Especially when he's not even the victim.
@heathermreid @deidhaul5 Disappointment.
@tor1981 @joe_duck @ctznsmith @electroknitter @timothypulleyn Peace will not give us great musical drama or help us get behind #TimsBehind
@tinytwink Although I've got a bit of skin coming away from the side of my nail and I'm moaning like fuck about that....
@tinytwink Maybe your twins need a Luftwaffe bombing campaign to live through? Help give them some perspective?
@LyndsayBurtonsh Good work!

@hayleycampbelly Happy Birthday!
@antonnewcombe @BBC @JeremyClarkson @zaynmalik He can do a segment testing Sat Navs called 'No Direction.'
@missprofanity He's got a segment testing Sat Navs called 'No Direction.'
@hayleycampbelly He's the new guy on Top Gear - he tests Sat Navs in a segment called 'No Direction.'
@WyattVW @JeremyClarkson @zaynmalik @onedirection Zayn could have a segment on Top Gear testing Sat-Navs called 'No Direction.'
A pomegranate and a fucking pineapple? My fruit bowl is now officially middle class.
@joe_duck As fucking ALWAYS.
@joe_duck Oh YES! I think I'm going for something like this:

@ctznsmith I think the bibs are especially worth it.
@joe_duck Link? Pictures?
@ctznsmith  @PaulSmithDesign @rapha It's like Dame Thora Hird said about good shoes/beds: If you're not in one, you're in the other.
@joe_duck I'm currently trawling ebay for flouro Briko's. Also, you need to follow Mario @CipolliniM on twitter!
@ctznsmith @PaulSmithDesign @rapha Oh, it's not a problem.
Everyone going bananas about the ASOS sale should try living with a Paul Smith and Rapha habit. @PaulSmithDesign @rapha
@AngrySalmond Is there some glue down there?
@Snuffband @DuncanRedmonds This is exciting!
@thedogsdaily @Scarfolk Funny? I think it gave me manic depression. Looking at Scarfolk house prices now....
@WeWantPlates Slates and jam jars get a mention:

@Johnny_Crash Of course, don't expect any technical proficiency...
Hello insomnia! I made this mix to listen to when I can't sleep. Feel free to give it a listen if you're up:


@WyattVW @RadioTimes @PlanetRockRadio Nice one Wyatt!
@MsJackMonroe @danthompson78 @SarahVine Disability insults? Classy.

@AngrySalmond Watching someone he loves go hungry might at least teach him a bit of empathy.
@_Mozza_ In a way it's comforting to know that's all they can attack her for.
@_Mozza_ What about a TV? How many nurses salaries is that? A car?! How many food banks could we open?
@BBCScotlandNews @BBCNews Well done BBC. Finger on the pulse as usual.
If a dog can learn to wave, why do other cyclists find it so difficult to wave back? 

@timothypulleyn Yeah, when you put it like that...

@ctznsmith Just back from hospital and I've got a lot more movement, still some pain but start physio tomorrow. I can ditch the sling too.
@Johnny_Crash Nice to know I've still got it.
Got asked out by a hot guy at hospital. Nice wee confidence boost to start the week.
@AndrewWK @StephShutUp @Convergecult Dat bike doe!
@mcewenrobbie @PiccoloEspresso Did you fuck it or eat it?
@DaftLimmy *sicks on own flaming cock* RIGHT, TA.

I've had Buckfast....
Probably going to smash my own kitchen...
@AndrewWK It's just science.
Thirteen again. 
@NivenJ1 @AaronCarpPUR @Dante_Banks This has really escalated.
@DaftLimmy Hope it didn't need demonstrated for you.
@greghemphill69 The Mothers Day fishing expedition is usually a good haul. I recommend it.
Remember everyone, clocks go either backwards or forwards this weekend or next weekend.
@WingsScotland Next week.
@NorrieHarman That wee sorry albino slug that just manages to fall out the end. Is that 5/5 now?
@missprofanity You'd think there's be a song about Culloden to sing instead.
@missprofanity Good idea. It's strange watching all those people that voted 'no' singing about Bannockburn.
@AmourDeVelo @ctznsmith See also: Sponsor my holiday.
@Johnny_Crash Happy spring fuckers!
It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade.
@hayleycampbelly So I can roll you around the ground for a while until I workout what the recovery position is.
@hayleycampbelly If that fails, I've just done a first aid course.
@Butsay_ Then pish yersel'. Aye, why not?
@Johnny_Crash Then another.
@Johnny_Crash And another.
@Butsay_ Or squeeze them into people's eyes.
Happiness is: Listening to an album you haven't heard for fifteen years and remembering all the words to every song.
They fuck you up, your mum and dad...

@deidhaul5 Brilliant question. Will Self is answering well. The rest just shat themselves.

@deidhaul5 I think she's given me manic depression.
@Johnny_Crash The Taxpayer's Alliance are really for rich people. Cost of living crisis isn't caused by tax if you're on minimum wage.

@Johnny_Crash Dimbleby doing his usual of allowing the right free speech and diverting or interrupting the left.
@85giom93xm15 @UK_Claim_A A prize! Yes!
@deidhaul5 Sorry.
@Johnny_Crash Here he goes....
@deidhaul5 Quavers multi-pack now open. They're shite with dips so pretending I'm at Heston Blumenthal's.
Really want Will Self to rip the arse out of everyone on QT tonight. #bbcqt
@deidhaul5 Totally with you here. Rinsed a tube of Pringles already. Also drunk.
@GKnollington @_Mozza_ Wow. Have they also mentioned the dressing down the rocket got from EVERYONE else?
@scottishlabour @Margaret_Curran Which isn't the same as increasing spending, is it? Will services remain woefully underfunded?
There should be a law passed that allows you to punch slow walking people and/or meanderers in the back of the head.
