“@kennahasanego: @chasemyyers SAME” yeah i doubt it
nathan just facetimed me
#2014in3words very life changing
if i ever got into a serious relationship i'd probably delete a lot of my social media accounts because it causes a lot of avoidable drama
iggy: lol okay
iggy: i'm just a bill yes, i'm only a bill and i'm sitting here on capitol hill
@sup_collin agreed!
@kb_jones37 i'm really not sure

“@Cameron_Rosas: @chasemyyers this is so cool and creepy at the same time!<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>” i know!
“@jxdenhi: @chasemyyers i need to go here omg” it's so interesting
i went inside an abandoned school today 
“@daaaarien: Nathan just looked at me and said "I love you best friend"” he better rethink that statement real fast

i'm literally all alone inside darien's house
"she was lying about lying, who does that?"
@Lalane384 no, let's forget <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>

#nicayden
BIG BROTHER IS ON, EVERYONE SHUT UP

@JasoonLovato you're like 5 hours late bYE
@sarahtomlinsonn touché
@sarahtomlinsonn me
@sarahtomlinsonn but to stop being someone's friend over it? that's messed up
@sarahtomlinsonn some people just want to escape from their emotional pain so they start to do it through psychical pain, it's a real issue
@sarahtomlinsonn but if someone is going through a rough time, they need friends to support them and get them through it
“@JasoonLovato: If i found out you self-harm but I continue being you're friend.. you're quite special.” the stupidity in this tweet
@whtvrbrie @morganpyrtle or nah
@morganpyrtle i'm in the 2/4 pics on here and i'm proud
happy birthday @whtvrbrie <PARTY POPPER><TWO HEARTS><NEW MOON WITH FACE>
