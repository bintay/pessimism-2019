@yo_skyla right, but her dad worked his ass off for them to have a more comfortable life
@yo_skyla not necessarily. yeah her dad was a lawyer but she didn't get sorta famous till like the 2005
@yo_skyla okay but her race is a minority if it happened. if she was mexican or black we wouldn't be having this argument most likely
pointless argument lol........................ wyd
@yo_skyla no but i'm sure her race has had it's problems with white people. just like mexicans
@yo_skyla she's armenian so i'm guessing she's lost people because of her race
@yo_skyla right, bc she's black.. yet she's in a huge mansion with all her BILLIONS.........
@yo_skyla youre lettin the stereotypes of the Kardashian fam get 2 you. you're right they're not doin anythin but wat bout the other celebs
@yo_skyla but if it was Oprah or another rich black person, most people wouldn't be tripping??? #doublestandards
#PrayForBaltimore because rich or not, a prayer is a prayer <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS> &amp; at the end we're all human beings
@yo_skyla if a person prays for an event thats happenin, rich or not, a prayer's a prayer. since when should u judge others by their wealth?
