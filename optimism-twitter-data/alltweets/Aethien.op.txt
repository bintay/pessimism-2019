@lsv Good luck!
@lsv I hope you can sleep on the plane.
@JeffHoogland Only in your dreams, or nightmares depending on your point of view.
@mtgworth I like the fact that it's Magic the most because Magic is a great game even in the dysfunctional shell that is MTGO.
@kaibudde With GP Vegas/Utrecht/Chiba coming up who isn't going to be playing sealed in the next couple weeks?
@ErikaMoen Not the most optimistic or happy comic that, is it? Interesting though.
@moxymtg Basically indistinguishable from Brimaz on his day off.
Genesis Hydra for 5 into Whisperwood Elemental manifesting Dragonlord Atarka, I'd call that a good turn. #mtgssl
@thoughtxriot @wizards_magic 
A 24/23 Den Protector is pretty good game. #mtgssl
@rbuehler Martin Muller's PTDTK draft deck performing better in standard than Modern storm did in Vintage it seems.
@rbuehler Is that more or less crazy than the Pyromancer's Ascension deck he showed up with in VSL season 1?
@lsv And the Kolagan was even in his deck for you to steal. Such a missed opportunity.
@ErikaMoen $387 now.
@BasicMountain CD's are great if effort has been put in the booklet and case, makes the whole thing more fun.
@jephjacques There is coffee out of bed, also music and cookies.
@fffreakmtg Cats, a man's best friend. &lt;3
@rbuehler @Marshall_LR this green deck sounds like Bram Snepvangers PT DTK list that he went 8-2 with in constructed.
@CedricAPhillips Delve is still broken as hell even on a green card.
@MarijnLybaert 600 spots? That is miniscule...
@magicprotour @efropoker Not many places available for a layover once you pass the east coast.
@efropoker @magicprotour 9773.088 miles as the crow flies according to the map tool I found.
@maro254 So, any chance of these lectures being streamed or posted on youtube or something of the like?
@Skelemania watching 7 matches in a row would take too long, we get 1 quarter and both semis and the finals.
@wizards_magic Board wipes, everything must die. All the time.
@MarijnLybaert GP Madrid 2010 at 2228 according to Wikipedia: 
@lsv Common sense is overrated anyway.
@ErikaMoen They're making me kind of hungry which is unfortunate since I forgot to do some much needed shopping today.
@rbuehler Ah yeah, that was a good one. Season 2 had a lot of spectacular games. Let's hope the SSL is just as good.
@CedricAPhillips I'd say it's closer to combo, the Belcher/Oops-All-Spells kind of all or nothing combo.
@fffreakmtg I don't think you can go very wrong with Esper Dragons or some form of Abzan Aggro.
@JasonMarker @THEKarlaPacheco @jephjacques F-Type Jaguar is a $70k+ car, not exactly a cheap car.
@meddlingmage confirmed best non @efropoker player in the #VSL. Only one to take matches from Efro not on Dredge. And 2 at that.
@rbuehler 3-0 to @efropoker, 3-1 if he plays Dredge.
@HAUMPH Well that's polite at least. And this is what all those hours in the gym were for right, to look imposing?
@_BigB1 @magicprotour 3 hours from now for the pregame/recap on the season, 4 hours for the actual matches.
@CalebDMTG Good luck!
@klug_alters @meddlingmage @samstod You don't even have to halve the number of PPTQ's in areas where RPTQ's are tiny.
@HAUMPH Gratz on qualifying for the next 5 PT's!
@PolLeiden @jochemmyjer als ik het goed schat komt dat neer op ongeveer een deciliter aan alcohol in het bloed. Indrukwekkend...
@meddlingmage Good luck in the next rounds!
@tournamentcentr Just hope the sky is a little less gloomy at the end of May.
@JorritBergsma Geen lelijk plekje dat.
@lsv @HeleneBergeot Is @ChannelFireball streaming the RPTQ at the gamecenter?
@HAUMPH We're expecting updates every round! ;)
@HAUMPH Good luck in the RPTQ today.
@meddlingmage I can only think of one good reason to go to Salt Lake City and Magic isn't it...
@simongoertzen Isn't it nice when your opponent plays a tapland turn 1 and you can immediately say "well, on to game 2 then?"
@simongoertzen Thankfully Infect can finish it's rounds quite quickly you have to.
@lsv I don;t know if you've read the article but this playmat needs to happen: 
@JadePhoenix13 @lsv @PVDDR It's LSV playing the hand, so yes.
@ErikaMoen A 10 feet tall painting of an eggplant would be pretty cool though.
Geen wonder dat @markrutte maandag zo vrolijk was, wat heeft @PvdA over zich heen laten lopen zeg... #bedbadbrood
@MarijnLybaert @HAUMPH He's as good at playing he deck as he is at pronouncing your name. :P
@ErikaMoen I've never heard of this TERF thing before, is it bad that I'm kinda curious about the rant now?
@lsv Who made the new art? You didn't mention that in the article and I can't quite make it out on the card image.
@meddlingmage @lsv Efro happened and @efropoker hasn't lost a match with any deck other than Dredge.
@ChannelFireball Playmat is sweet though.
@ChannelFireball Literally zero. Which isn't too difficult considering the 4 spoiled so far.
@magicprotour That's an odd twitter tag for GP Toronto. #GPKRAKOW
@jephjacques 
@meddlingmage @lsv @magicprotour @efropoker During his stream he was thinking of Painter's Servant and Chains of Mephistopheles decks...
@PVDDR This article had some hands I'd genuinely struggle with and made me reconsider some things. Good food for thought.
@rbuehler @Skelemania We can only hope the matches will be as spectacular as the names imply.
@Tolaria_DWest Only 6 more months and it'll be gone forever. Or until the next reprint anyway.
@MrJamesMay @RichardHammond He's trying to steal your thunder James.
@postrk Wow, now that looks like a reason to visit Krakow.
@lsv @Top8Games @Rothiray The sheer increase in numbers alone makes GP's and such much harder.
@lsv Time to start brewing up some anti control decks...
@meddlingmage not necessarily, plenty of art worth tens of millions get simple or no frame.
@NumotTheNummy @mtgworth @lsv stopped streaming so you'll have to stream the top 8 now. ;)
@meddlingmage Those frames look rather weird around a Frazetta, I'd have expected simpler frames.
@JustM0Bin @Gfabs5 Noise cancelling is mostly useless anyway, expensive and has very limited applications.
@JustM0Bin @Gfabs5 Bose is more or less the same as Beats. Bose stands for Buy Other Sound Equipment after all.
@JeffHoogland Looks less bad than control mirrors usually are. And at the very least it's not the GW Devotion mirror.
@Gfabs5 for Beats perhaps but you can get much better in that pricerange.
@Gfabs5 Beats are never good deals, you pay for the label rather than for quality headphones.
24 minuten en 2-0, PSV wil liefst na de 1e helft de schaal al binnen hebben. #psvhee
@realJohnAvon It's a great shot, could fit right into an Anton Corbijn movie.
@lsv I watch your stream/videos to hear you discuss plays as you're making them and the 10 minute delay doesn't bother me in the slightest.
@Marshall_LR @_DavidOchoa It's the beer, Alvinne makes a lot of nice beers.
@jephjacques It's probably Pintsize.
@BasicMountain @CedricAPhillips @py__ @Smdster If scouting is as elaborate as it seems I don't see why this shouldn't be done.
@KaolinTiger @OwenTweetenwald @mtg_ianduke @wizards_magic Very much this, I don't want a Pro Tour without Ian Duke anymore.
@HAUMPH @PygJones If the RPTQ doesn't work out you still have GP Vegas and potentially GP Copenhagen to get to gold in time, right?
@CedricAPhillips Unlimited data is a beautiful thing.
@efropoker Just guessing but I imagine a reinstall would do it.
@rbuehler @efropoker I'd recommend not playing Dredge.
@_DavidOchoa I should go back there then, it's been a while and I'm down to my last few bottles.
@_DavidOchoa Such a wonderful place. Do they still have Zwanze?
@lsv Well there is no fat in fries. At least not until you fry them in beef fat as they do in Belgium.
@meddlingmage What doesn't kill you makes you stronger or something like that.
@realJohnAvon So when can we see that on the art for an Island? Cause that looks wonderful.
@meddlingmage If only there were vintage PPTQ's, right?
@SamuelHBlack Might have already been the last Satyr?
Lifegain from Courser is pretty sweet. #PTDTK
@lsv Nicolai Herzog also explained the reference on stream yesterday so that wasn't particularly difficult to call.
Rough matchup for Hendriks, great games for both and gratz to @AdrianLSullivan! #PTDTK
@WJelger Good luck, great to see some Dutch flags at the top of the PT standings.
It's a joy to watch Shota Yasooka play UB Control. Great to see him top 8. #PTDTK
@meddlingmage @efropoker Probably but I'm not sure Efro still knows how to do that.
@meddlingmage @AdamNightmare Failure to predict the meta/not enough dragons. Also the deck is supposedly very difficult to play.
@meddlingmage UB Control, second biggest archetype and 90% of it made day 2.
@JeffHoogland Dickmann's UR Dragons splashing white for Ojutai looks sweet as well and close to your deck.
@HAUMPH 8-0 in Standard now, right?
@MJCKaas @magicprotour Just after the End Hostilities, a couple seconds after the time in the link.
@MJCKaas @magicprotour 
@magicprotour Someone should look at this: 
@bmkibler Well those type of games have existed for 2 decades so I guess it's technically correct.
@HAUMPH What did you draft?
@HAUMPH Really hoping you'll be able to win the next 6 and get yourself (that much closer to) gold.
@HAUMPH 5 down, 8 to go. X-3 is good enough!
@CedricAPhillips Add #PTDTK to your tweets so more people see them.
@CedricAPhillips It just seems so wrong to give a gameloss for a gamestate that is so easy to repair. Mindboggling.
Camera should be pulled into this if necessary, it would be an awfully pointless game loss otherwise. #PTDTK
@meddlingmage @JamieParke 1-1 with 3 minutes on the clock and they decided not to bother with game 3.
I have to applaud wizards for making Morph significant in constructed without breaking limited. #PTDTK
@HAUMPH 1 down, 12 to go!
@bmkibler That's a good start to the PT for the people watching.
@lsv If you're half as lucky as you were in your last VSL match we'll see you in the top 8.
@jodyray25 @_DavidOchoa It's a nice place to be.
@paulrietzl Brussels is a pretty damn good place for beer.
@lsv Four dragons and not even a Silumgar's Scorn in there, disappointing.
@lsv @HAUMPH Your enthusiasm is truly inspiring.
@meddlingmage @kaibudde You can just go to past broadcasts and play it from there.
Why is a deck with Courser of Kruphix and 7 drops called Aggro? Makes no sense at all. Why not G/R Dragons? #SCGNY
@Gfabs5 9th is unfortunate but still a pretty damn good result. Your deck looked fun and damn Atarka is HUGE.
@jephjacques Where's the "I'm getting one anyway" button?
@JeffHoogland The latter, no doubt.
@lsv I would bet on no, I live further north but the notion of burritos for breakfast is disturbing. We do have pancakes for dinner though.
@HAUMPH It's currently 7:50 PM in Brussels, enjoy the jetlag!
@bmkibler Stroopwafels are the greatest thing on earth.
@HAUMPH is all fired up over beating @NumotTheNummy, I guess he really wants his #4 ranking back on the top 25 Cheons list.
I feel sorry for these Polish guys, being publicly sacrificed in the name of diversity. #EHL
Het verschil in kwaliteit tussen de teams is eigenlijk te groot, monsterscores zijn niet heel leuk om naar te kijken. #EHL
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! #MTGVSL :(
@lowbeyonder Half the reason people play Dredge irl is that it's 1/6th the cost of other decks and that's not changing.
Dredge and #MTGVSL are not a good match this season, not at all.
Belcher may not be interactive but it sure it spectacular. #MTGVSL
@meddlingmage Well, those 2 games aught to make up for the punt in the first one. TNN is not a bad magic card.
@meddlingmage For what it's worth, you probably weren't winning the game anyway. Steve had everything.
@magicprotour if course, who doesn't want to watch more VSL?
@magicprotour #6waytie obviously. #MTGVSL
@bazardebagda Pretty much my thoughts on it. a pre-release 2 weeks after I've already played prereleases is kind of pointless.
@misterorange @magicprotour Last season they split online Power 9 over the winners, mostly it's bragging rights.
@OwenTweetenwald Fries &gt; waffles. Also beer &gt; waffles.
Finals didn't quite deliver what the names promised. Manascrew and mulligans suck. #SCGINVI
@Bananenprut @Boss_MTG 2 pump spells, 2 berserk is my guess.
@JeffHoogland How do you like your standard deck? It looked very cool.
@JeffHoogland Good luck!
@erbenwennemars @NOSsport Het was wel duidelijk dat het bij Corendon niet loopt maar ik vraag me nu af of het nog goed komt.
@jephjacques At least it keeps you entertained while you wait for your flight?
@NumotTheNummy So with you commentating on the MOCS does that mean you'll be practicing constructed to know what you're talking about?
@rbuehler there is the risk of all 3 players going 1-1 but in that case regular season results against each other can break ties.
@rbuehler Only 1 more match total than a bracket with byes too. #VSL
@rbuehler With a 6 way tie for last wouldn't it be cleaner to have 3 matches then the 3 losers have a 3 match round robin? No byes that way.
@JeffHoogland 5 colour goodstuff with a fetching manabase?
@rbuehler And here I don't even want my standard deck in ultra-pro's, I think I'd get a heart attack shuffling up a Vintage deck in them...
@jephjacques How many hours of your life have been wasted listening to muzak while you're on hold?
@NumotTheNummy Can you tweet when it's working again (or when you give up)?
@MrJamesMay Being "unemployed" probably feels a lot better when you can just drive your Ferrari around when you're bored.
@efropoker No easy way I imagine, this is MTGO after all.
@NumotTheNummy Also Vintage, Vintage is so cool to watch.
@NumotTheNummy One of the best parts of MtG streams for me is seeing better players analyze their play.
@jephjacques Jesus that looks like a post apocalyptic wasteland...
@MoxReuby @AJSacher Gerards opponent got a little overexcited at making it to the finals and gave a rather aggressive handshake
Limited GP lesson 1: don't draft an amazing deck because that means you get destroyed. #gpcleveland
@norbert88 @ChannelFireball Zemanjaski
@sjinkieknegt laat zien dat Nederland een schaatsland is, ongeacht de lengte van de baan. Super prestatie en wat verschrikkelijk spannend!
@jephjacques It's a pretty ukelele though.
@klug_alters So when are you going to do original art for magic? :P
@NumotTheNummy X-2 is live for top 8. Go Kenji Go!
@NumotTheNummy Good luck!
@NumotTheNummy #whitelist
@TheZvi Now you just have to wait 40+ minutes for round 2!
@NumotTheNummy I'm expecting you to do well enough that I can just follow you through coverage. :P
@ActuallyNPH It means that you should pet the kitten because kittens are adorable.
@StevenWilsonHQ the limited editon of HAND. CANNOT. ERASE. has made an already wonderful album that much better. Great concept and design!
@Ireenw Niet geschoten is altijd mis, misschien is er een Dominos in de buurt?
@tournamentcentr Editing the registration rewards image with a line showing how many preregs there are would be pretty cool.
@tournamentcentr Ok, cool. Out of curiosity what's the prereg number at now?
@tournamentcentr is there a running counter of how many pre-registrations there are anywhere?
@rbuehler Great week, when matches in standard last long I get bored but in the VSL they're the best ones.
@jephjacques 
@NumotTheNummy Birds are telling you that if you can't fall asleep through chirping you're not tired enough to stop streaming.
@lsv Basically the same as all other non premium energy drinks I'd imagine.
@bmkibler They have to do something to make flying from San Diego to Boston look like a good idea.
@OwenTweetenwald 
@Marshall_LR Makes you hungry, doesn't it?
@SamuelHBlack @bmkibler @cavemankellen @norbert88 At the very worst it's a slightly worse Skullcrack which isn't a bad place to start.
@marktuitert @NUsport iedereen die niet dacht dat Sochi een uitzonderung was weet na dit schaatsseizoen wel beter.
@SamuelHBlack @wrapter Shame it's a sorcery and not an instant though.
@BraunDuinIt There's a 4 mana dragon too!
@_DavidOchoa Nice beers, how was the vintage Iris?
@AndrewCuneo Will is sweet in the @LSV tempo decks and underwhelming elsewhere, I haven't been too impressed by the priest. though.
@rbuehler @bmkibler @lsv @TomLaPilleMagic @samstod The arena lands are pretty cool too.
@rbuehler @Taladel @samstod @TomLaPilleMagic Playing Vintage with new border lands is just wrong.
@HAUMPH @NumotTheNummy @MishrasFotoshop Challenge Kenji to a duel during his 24h stream to determine who is the better Cheon.
@ErikaMoen If it wasn't for the Fleshlight I'd expect a comic involving tentacles with that sound effect.
@lsv Go Shops go!
@kevinan @tommartell Daze reprint would be nice, same with Counterspell.
@rbuehler @kaibudde If it's deemed too strong for Standard Modern Masters should be a way to introduce new cards to Modern.
@JeffHoogland I think the garbage audio is just as big a reason. I'd at least tune into Denver in between rounds without that crap.
@NumotTheNummy Gratz on day 2, good luck tomorrow! (and in round 9)
@HAUMPH Gratz on day 2.
@NumotTheNummy 3 wins down, 4 to go!
@HAUMPH Good luck!
@NumotTheNummy I'll be waiting for the Numot vs Haumph feature match later today.
@AndreasPischner @Gfabs5 
@lsv @efropoker @HAUMPH If only if it was a Vintage GP.
@tommartell #blameworth
@kaibudde @lsv Matches don't last long when LSV has @mtgworth stack his deck for him.
@rbuehler So how's the week off? Relaxing or disappointing because you don't get to play VSL this week?
@wizards_magic Torrent Elemental, Torrent Elemental and Torrent Elemental with honorable mentions for Abzan Beastmaster and Write Into Being
@HAUMPH It was good fun, looking forward to the next one. :P
@jephjacques When you only see yourself through selfies you can't see how stupid you look with a selfie stick.
@_DavidOchoa @TheTrappist I'm jealous, Hitachino is awesome.
@ShaniDavis Congratulations on your victory! Fantastic last lap on the 1k!
@HAUMPH Still very much a work in progress but how about this for a shirt design? 
@jephjacques It's certainly.. euh... special.
@meddlingmage Happy birthday!
@jephjacques The Grammies are a joke anyway and they're utterly clueless when it comes to Metal.
@ReidDuke I too made that mistake, erroneously thought it would be fine if I only had 2 creatures.
@muldermichel Nog 3 jaar en dan de volgende!
@klug_alters A lotta searching and shufflin' mostly
#PTFRF Tasigur is basically Tarmogoyf and Dark Confidant rolled into one.
@MrThaddeusM What the last core set will be I imagine.
@karsten_frank @WJelger On the other hand, the both of you on the world cup team would be pretty damn sweet.
@RLeiningen They're showing all quarterfinals one at a time.
@spaalb @wizards_magic Yeah, 9Am EST I think.
@spaalb @wizards_magic Same time as the past 2 days
Before I forget, gratz @WJelger with the top 8 and surpassing 400 lifetime pro points! #PTFRF
@CedricAPhillips @BasicMountain They somehow didn't see that the dual land was a karoo while the only dual lands in the deck are karoos...
@FrankLepore I think there were 2 pacts?
@simongoertzen Nothing happens, it's a loop until either player decides not to redirect the damage because it says may.
@RoyalSlasher @magicprotour @karsten_frank Wouldn't that basically be his (many) articles and videos on @ChannelFireball?
#PTFRF Daneblast? It's all about double Strike now.
#ptfrf Red Green Double Strike combo is a draft archetype now.
@rbuehler High time for a new top 8, I'm rooting for an all Dutch finals.
@hrslaton numbers to keep track of which morph is which.
@karsten_frank the dream of an all Dutch finals is alive!
#ptfrf A win for @karsten_frank and @Wjelger, hup Holland hup!
@JeffHoogland Also the black box for hands and whatnot is a tiny bit shorter than the video. It's just dreadful design all over.
@KnightDelSol Acetone on the borders makes them white.
@magicprotour Go @HAUMPH go!
@NegativeWon You can also activate 2 Gavony Townships with 7 mana according to Randy &amp; Rashad.
@NegativeWon Said no one, ever. All respect to the man for his behind the scenes work but he's just awful at commentating.
@WJelger rare drafting for the win.
@wrapter brutal start, good luck in modern!
#ptfrf Go @WJelger! Maybe if you're on camera more the commentators will learn how to pronounce your name.
@HAUMPH GP Top 8 followed by GP win in your last 2 events, obviously a PT top 8 is next.
#ptfrf Jeskai Ascendancy and Treasure Cruise, broken no matter which format they're played in.
@Boss_MTG Good luck, hoping to see you in the top 8!
@tommartell At least you're not in Europe, mtgo downtime lasts well into the evening here...
@JeffHoogland it's clearly time to move into Vintage to play with Dig Through Time some more.
@BasicMountain I just know that CFB GP's keep me away from watching SCG because of the timeshift. @HAUMPH story helped too.
@BasicMountain @JeffHoogland GPSJ is a reason, timeshifted matches make CFB streams so incredibly much more enjoyable to watch.
@lsv not quite Goblinslide but impressive nonetheless.
@HAUMPH That finals was totally worth skipping a night's sleep for. Gratz on the PT qualification!
@Syntheticuh @HAUMPH Top 4 qualifies him for PT Brussels (which he already has), GP win gets him Silver and that gets him to DC.
@efropoker #LuckyFroehlich
@HAUMPH Cruel way to lose a round though, missing that a white permanent got the red loot ability rather than the blue one.
@lsv @Marshall_LR Most important moment of the GP so far for sure.
@HAUMPH @ChannelFireball May the bomb rares be with you.
@MTGStocks @JeffHoogland @BraunDuinIt But why jump through the extra hoops needed to get there when Griselbrand wins you the game anyway?
@klug_alters The image has gotten so abstract it reminds me of the windows in the Sagrada Familia. Cool alter.
@jephjacques The snow is your punishment for (maybe) killing faye you murderer! But really, comic was due for a good shakeup.
#FourMTGCards The star of my early Magic days, my favourite card ever, my first FNM win and my current favourite. 
@ChannelFireball Collector Protector @ CFB looks way cooler on Facebook too.
@ChannelFireball Order fulfillment technician is kind of a bullshit name, couldn't you have found a card to give the function a title?
@jephjacques a draw is when you and your opponent end at the same score in a match or game. Does that help?
@KevGrove @CalebDMTG @BraunDuinIt Because people are stupid and assume that because it's on the banlist it MUST be good.
@BraunDuinIt It was restricted just over 19 years ago and since then Wizards has forgotten that it's a card that exists.
@FleshReaver @BasicMountain Pretty good I'd guess. Burn doesn't lose that much from losing cruise.
@JeffHoogland @MagicOnline because magic players are prone to hyperbole and exaggeration.
@Workshops94 @MagicOnline @HAUMPH People are throwing hundreds of dollars at him, I'm sure she'll be fine. :P
@straca3 @bazardebagda Mics were on for a few minutes while they thought they were off air. Sounded mostly joking but not classy.
Not a fan of the turbo matches, too fast to follow the details and even the commentators hardly know what's going on half the time. #gpomaha
@verweijkoen zo'n 5000m, daar kijken we schaatsen voor! #EKAllround
@rbuehler Thumbs up! Already excited and hoping it'll be as good as S1. #VSL
@rbuehler Any news on VSL Season 2? I am aching for some sweet vintage action.
@RichardHammond Drink beer instead.
@misterorange @efropoker It's not what I'd call an easy to follow structure and it looks a bit wonky but the idea behind it is great.
Shame to see @Boss_MTG lose with infect, still a great match and congrats to @fffreakmtg!
@katybirdz @fffreakmtg &amp; @Boss_MTG now battle for last spot in top 4.
@efropoker SCG tweets updated brackets after just about every match
@efropoker Loser is out, winner goes into top 4.
@RedhawkWill There have been some insane matches in the Vintage Super League but other than that, I can't think of anything.
#SCGPC has so far more than delivered on spectacular matches. Reid Duke really showing why he's in the top 3 best players in the wold.
@_travis2323 @scglive group winners are in top 4, group #4's are out, other 4 fight for the last 2 spots in top 4.
@bazardebagda I love the idea behind the format, not sure if I like the execution. And the field for day 2 looks spectacular.
@JeffHoogland are you still running Rec. Sage in the side and if so why those over Back to Nature?
@OwenTweetenwald I appreciate SCG's attempt to make almost every match matter/be between 2 potential winners but the format is a bit silly.
@lsv Clearly you are being unfairly helped by a sophisticated manipulation of MTGO's randomization by WotC.
@scglive #SCGPremium Top Level Podcast
@JeffHoogland Good luck in the top 8, hopefully the Open top 8 is quicker than the Invitational top 8.
@FrankLepore Just pray there won't be a game 5...
@scglive #scgpremium Whelming Wave
@scglive #scgpremium Chandra, Pyromaster
@SuprFluffyKitty At least it's not a mirror match.
@thepchapin @CedricAPhillips Devoted Caretaker?
@Peer_Rich round 13-16.
Man Jeskai Ascendancy is ridiculous #SCGINVI
@JeffHoogland Good luck at the invitational! May you avoid all Belchers in legacy. ;)
Josh Ravitz has good taste in lands woth the EURO plains and forest. #SCGPORT
@karsten_frank You should have used orange sleeves for the team spirit. Still rooting for you to squeeze into top 8!
@karsten_frank Gratz on the win and good luck in the next round for the 3-0 and top seat! #MTGWMC
Netherlands 4-0, Hup Holland Hup! #MTGWMC
Well played @thepchapin! Last minute victory. #MTGChamp
Grindclock as a win condition... #SCGATL
@starcitygames Very disappointed in the lack of Legacy coverage. Standard is fun but not for 2 days a week.
@warfordium 
I think I could watch @SMenendian vs @lsv vintage matches for all eternity without getting bored.  #MTGVSL
Damn I love Vintage &lt;3 #MTGVSL
@mtgRikipedia no that's just @SMenendian.
@SMenendian is a very patient man. #MTGVSL
@magicprotour @lsv @SMenendian I don't care who wins, I'm just hoping for the max amount of games.
@Xander756 @dieplstks @imrahil327 @alreadyignored unfortunately for you, your former employer disagrees.
@Xander756 @DylanZahn sure, you're not a victim though.
@Xander756 @DylanZahn cause getting fired for being an idiot on the internet is totally the same as getting raped because you wore a dress..
@WildKatMTG Burn, 10 fetches though.
@Skelemania @scglive FNM Swords, foil FoW, judge flooded plains, foil Jace and more. That's some sweet, sweet shiny cardboard #GPNJ
The sea of people behind the commentators is looling crazy on stream.  #GPNJ
Hey @rbuehler, how about running a EuroVSL alongside the USVSL for S2? I'd love to get my live vintage kicks without staying up all night
@ErikaMoen Maybe they're very pretty candles? Or very large candles? I'm sure those 3+ft tall decorated ones that churches have are $80+.
The dream is alive! #MTGVSL #8WayTie
@wizards_magic @rbuehler Looking forward to this round! #MTGVSL #8waytie
@BasicMountain It's not quite mooing but Rhino noises are kinda close. And really weird. 
@MtGMatthias @BasicMountain Sentinels gets +1/+1 for each creature with a +1/+1 counter on it so it blocks through temur charm #gporlando
@oarsman79 probabpy the concession but the Reanimator vs Dredge match is the funniest thing I've seen all weekend.
#SCGNJ Now this is the kind of magic I love to see, graveyard shenanigans and hilarity.
#SCGNJ Reanimator firing on all cylinders is a thing of beauty.
#scgpremium Timetwister (the rollercoaster)
#SCGNJ #scgpremium Chris Vanmeter vs Brian Braun-Duin
#SCGNJ Deflecting Palm is looking a lot better than I expected it to be.
@maurih1games @MtGMatthias there are standard and modern lists flying around, both pretty interesting if fragile.
@MtGMatthias What's your opinion on the Jeskai Ascendancy storm decks that have been flying around? (And are there any at #SCGNJ ?)
@mtgaaron Would love to see more Legacy and Vintage in paper. It's great to see old cards in action.
