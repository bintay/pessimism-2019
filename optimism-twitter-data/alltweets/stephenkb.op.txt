@bspeed8 Not at all. The kitchen's in a state. (This metaphor isn't working for me, is it?)
Labour &amp; the Liberal Democrats both getting their post-defeat membership spikes, as the liberal left shouts as one "Shit, kitchen's a mess."
@pauljduffy Yeah.
The brass neck of this person is quite something. 
Tony Blair writes for the Observer on where Labour goes next: 
Tomorrow's Sindy looks like a must-read: 
@talktoharris1 If. And even then...
What's in this is good. What's missing is what may sink him: an answer to the Ukip problem. 
.@ChukaUmunna sets out his stall in the Observer tomorrow: 
@GavinHJackson But agree it's been missing so far. (As has the Ukip-inflicted Welsh horror show for Labour.)
@GavinHJackson I can safely say that some people are commissioning stuff on that.
@GavinHJackson In Bale's article written before the election, in my tweet or by me in general? If the latter, simply wrong
@GavinHJackson Don't think anyone is saying that was the *only* problem. Merely that was a problem.
@GavinHJackson But idea that the failure to really convince Tory voters not to return to Labour not a factor is balls.
@GavinHJackson Lib Dem collapse is why Tories were able to get a majority with a near-identical vote share - scale unexpected, cause known.
@GavinHJackson How so?
@GavinHJackson Indeed. Tim Bale wrote a good piece on all this for us: 
...received a lot of texts from the Labour left with the words "Mid-Staffs". And even more with the words "Owen Smith".
@GavinHJackson A different problem. Labour didn't make enough of the Tories' gaffes.
It's day one of what may be a long old race. But my first impression is that Burnham's chances are worse than I thought yesterday...
@JCHabeeb @tonyblairoffice He's not a candidate in the leadership race.
I'm not saying he was the end of Labour's problems. But any analysis of 2015 that doesn't at least begin with Ed Miliband has problems.
People were so angry with New Labour about Iraq they voted for David Cameron. Who voted for it. Seems legit. 
@chrisdeerin @Markfergusonuk Although I agree with the point you're making and to be honest I don't really understand why I'm picking hairs.
@chrisdeerin @Markfergusonuk Nicola Sturgeon can hardly claim to have come up from outside the SNP officer class, though.
@PauldeHaas1 I wasn't clear, sorry: I mean strong in the internal election. Not a wider call on effectiveness.
A Cooper-Watson joint ticket would take some beating. A lot of organisational strength and favours owed.
Yesterday, some close supporters of Cooper were worried she wouldn't run. They were wrong: 
A Labour insider recently described Badley as "the greatest organiser we've got" - a coup for Cooper: 
Yvette Cooper's aides register 
@DPJHodges Suggestion you turn it into TWO charity events. One to streak. One not to streak. Pit Ukippers against polite society.

@joel_pearce I hadn't, thank you.

@alancalder I just missed an opportunity for a "hilarious" joke about Hunt's politics
@alancalder We'd win that by miles, but you've got a Waitrose.
@AlasdairMSmith Ugh. David vs Ed: the Chamakh vs Bendtner of social democracy.
@PauldeHaas1 "You can't say you weren't warned".
@Lawrence_Kay Thanks - very kind.

@noboa More broadly, I think Scottish Labour neglected its electorate for decades, and after the referendum, people noticed.
@noboa My colleague George very good on the economics: 
@helenlewis Sadly, my copy is in the office, propping up the monitor.
Re-reading my interview with Harriet Harman. This feels quite painful, in retrospect: 
@AbiWilks Also worth noting that in Ashcroft polls, if every Labour identifier who didn't want Ed as PM switched, you'd get what we got.
@AbiWilks Sorry, I meant Tories were leading in phone polls, not online. Basically you get what you pay for.
@AbiWilks There wasn't a "late swing" - Tories were leading in online polls since January, &amp; Lab field intelligence got the swing dead on.
Our day consists of one or the other of us answering the phone, saying "Yeah, it's awful", then leaving the room.
@simonk133 Agree - hence the word "posture" not "platform".
@simonk133 The SNP's austerity programme was more severe than Labour's. (Seriously, I don't think left/right was the Scottish problem.)
@mrdavidwhitley @RealWitan The latter is a better thing to talk about - even to many people on payday loans. (2/2)

@Daniel_McAteer @MnWthtQualities @DavidMills73 ...or the minimum wage.
@Daniel_McAteer @MnWthtQualities @DavidMills73 Miliband a leftward shift rhetoric-wise. But had nothing as radical policy-wise as the OU...
@Daniel_McAteer @MnWthtQualities @DavidMills73 Brand would have been a better word than "posture".
@infinitesmurfs Indeed - last Labour government enacted large swathes of 1980s programme. Just wasn't aggressive about it.
@infinitesmurfs Policy-wise, not at all. But a posture of picking fights with cartoon villains, soaring rhetoric about a new economy, etc...
@MnWthtQualities @DavidMills73 ...trying to point out that maybe - maybe - calling me smug was a bit unnecessary.
@MnWthtQualities @DavidMills73 I did - chose the word "posture" quite deliberately. Was going to develop it but instead wasted time...
@MnWthtQualities @DavidMills73 @FoxHedgehog It may be that the British electorate has materially changed since the 1980s. I thought it had.
@MnWthtQualities @DavidMills73 @FoxHedgehog I'm going to take this moment to say I genuinely did mean the "may".
@MnWthtQualities @DavidMills73 As an editor I've learned people don't need an excuse for rudeness, merely an opportunity.
@MattRedmore @jatrius I don't think it's even accurate to say there will be *a* modernising candidate. That post will be contested, I think.
@MnWthtQualities @DavidMills73 Well, at least I'm not rude to strangers on the basis of their punctuation: 
@MattRedmore @jatrius I don't think there's going to be a "Progress candidate". Not really accurate to talk about "their views", either.
@jatrius Neither Burnham, Kendall or Cooper are "from London". And all more likely - at least based on the conversations I've had.
@jatrius Jarvis doesn't have enough of a powerbase, I think.
The campaign against Chuka Umunna is going to get quite ugly, I think.
It may be a coincidence that Labour's most leftwing posture since 1987 led to its worst result since 1987. But it seems unlikely. #GE2015

@KevinMFeeney Thanks. A dubious but welcome accolade.
Did Axelrod understand the electoral system of the UK? It would explain much if the answer was no. 
This tweet should have stopped at "failure".  
Next tweet from Axelrod: a selfie, lying on a bed made of the money Labour paid him. #GE2015  
Eep: 
This @jreedmp piece is the most incisive analysis by a Labour politician on these last few days yet:

Caroline's solution to the #ge2015 blues.

@faceofboe Always try to to refer to them as they. Don't always succeed.
Prophetic on Liberal woe from @rafaelbehr: 
@RichTKelly Gah, meant 2013 - Shadow Cabinet reshuffle.
@guy_herbert Shunted out to the BBC - some chat in Labour circles about putting it under Dfid, rightly in my view.
Labour got Nick Clegg sacked! This means they're in office, right? I ask because they way they went on at him, you'd think so...
Nick Clegg on the World Service - me again soon, #bushifandom.
@gimpyblog I'll do a headcount later. I think so, though.
Ironically I'm talking about the results on the World Service: a great British export. Now under some threat.
Fuck.  
@aishagani But to describe one faction of the Tories as "Thatcherite" would be unhelpful and inaccurate. Same here.

@stephanieboland On until 12 on and off
I'm on the World Service where they've just given me @c_crampton's job - sorry Caroline!
@faceofboe No - his national polls were only as wrong as everyone else's.
If there is one thing this election should put to bed, it's the idea that "of course" Gaitskell would have won in 64 and "anyone" in 97.

My hero of the night: the Labour staffer who texted the word "Duck" three times before giving up and texting "Goose!"
@gusbbaker It's alright. ;) Loyal silence an underrated virtue of Labour activists and candidates who deserved better, though.
@sean_longcroft Most people don't seem to have read down to the bit where I poison-pilled my own story, sssh.
@paulwaugh If you name people you take all the fun out of subtweeting.
I revealed Labour staffers fearing a mere 1% swing to them earlier this week. Looks like 1.5%: 
@richdhw A marginal Tory said this to me a while back "we are narrow because our mandate is narrow". Probs true.
Scoreboard journalism: Same people asking yesterday if Tories could ever win a majority now asking if Labour can ever recover. #GE2015
@annadoble Liz Kendall worth watching.
@RobBurl Chuka Umunna was Compass' great white hope in 2010, now regarded as a Blairite. Things change &amp; that.
@RobBurl Well, Ed Miliband wrote the 2010 manifesto and defined himself as a break from the past.
People will argue, some from conviction, some from calculation, that Labour spent too long looking at its navel last time.
I doubt very much that the NEC, currently tilted towards the left, will want to give anyone time to beat Burnham.
A lot depends on the timetable. Labour's NEC went for a long contest last time - to give someone the opportunity to beat David Miliband.
If looking to make money, Liz Kendall and Owen Smith the best value bets on Labour leader. But Burnham inevitable, I think.
Thinking of betting on Tristram Hunt? Burn that money instead.  

Superb and farsighted by @NCPoliticsUK -  who called the disaster: 
@sunny_hundal @stefanstern ...stone wouldn't have looked so stupid.
@sunny_hundal @stefanstern If the promises had meant squat "a NHS with time to care" - "controls on immigration" - we have those....
@stefanstern Indeed - if you are not credible you are not radical. "Cancer test in a week" probably summed up Labour's awfulness best.

@tmlbk @chrishanretty 'sup?
@mkeirle On a serious note, that their ground game picked up the deluge is a credit to that part of their operation. Hollow comfort, but...
@mkeirle Not to toot my horn but I am currently the author of the definitive article on Labour's on the ground woes: 
@craigawoodhouse One Labour MP told me last week that it was all nonsense, to be fair to them.

@GavinHJackson Would be arguable if the government had deregulated all that much.
@AbiWilks Aw, man, this retraction means I'm going to have Tippex on my Enemies' List.
Big, if true.  
Cognitive dissonance: to claim government doesn't create jobs but praise this one for "two million new jobs". Which is it? #GE2015
Not convinced endorsements are an anachronism. Both ours and the Guardian's were their most read items for some time, AIUI. #GE2015
I could totally have been on this programme. #GE2015
To discuss whether newspapers have been too partisan, Sky News Tonight has representatives from three papers that backed the Tories. #GE2015

I wondered last summer if Nigel Farage was leaving it too late to challenge in Thanet South: 
@ScottA1971 ....I'll get your coat.
@ScottA1971 That wasn't a secret tax bombshell. I meant more of the "Will you rule out x" style thing.
@stefanstern The note makes sense to me. But the sandwich? Good for the Tories if he's an object of derision. Not good to join in.
Surprise of #GE2015 : I expected "Red Ed's secret tax bombshell" stories . Instead it's been "Red Ed eats food, and occasionally has sex".
ICM: "A new dawn has broken, has it not? Seriously, guys, has it? Help us out." #GE2015 
@hansmollman That looked more like a black power salute than I intended.

@citygeographics A lot has changed for both parties since then - also it's not my graph.
The nightmare, now in graph form thanks to @NCPoliticsUK: 
@RyanDevlin_ Misery loves company.
@rafaelbehr I think 2012 was about par but otherwise, yes.
The nightmare of the 2014 elections refuses to go away: the Tory vote holding up better than we expect, Labour failing to break through.
He'll do to LabourList what he's done to the country. :(  
@callummay Was surprised at how much more polished he was compared to D Miliband's uncertain performance earlier on in the night.
Legend status for the first MP to quip on election night that hung parliaments are like buses - wait ages for one and then... #GE2015
Handy tip to anyone arguing about legitimacy &amp; how it works in a hung parliament. Miliband nailed it five years ago: 
Relistening to the 2010 election. Look who's just turned up: 
@patrick_hurley Across two tweets, sorry: 

Fascinating Polling Matters discussion between @robfordmancs &amp; @keiranpedley. A must-listen: 
What do the polls say about the #GE2015 battleground in Wales? @roger_scully explains: 
@Gary_Bainbridge O_O
@tristram32 Yes - I think Jones is saying that Miliband is a Foot clone. A brave argument to make.
@Gary_Bainbridge Sadly, I have not.
Forget selling the gold. Digby Jones was Gordon Brown's worst mistake. 
@sarahditum I'm a believer in the "misery loves company" school of journalism.
On @TheStaggers, @JonnElledge lights the blue touchpaper. 
Well, this is strange: 
@FrPip Thanks!
I feel I keep writing the sentence "Gordon Brown has given the speech of his life", but... 
@scepticalscot 4:30 - sorry, that's an glaring omission and a half, will amend.
@PaulFrame85 If you're in a marginal seat like Nicky Morgan or Ed Balls you still have to do both...
@simonk133 "A mere legal necessity" in the old phrase.
Why not get MPs and MSPs to do the same?
An idea doing the rounds in ScotLabour circles I like: councilors sign a campaign contract to do a certain number of hours on the doors.
@hugorifkind One Labour candidate claims this is why they've gained a stone during the short campaign.
@Uncivil_S @FoxHedgehog @JshRbnsn So it's basically just a way of saying "I dislike this".
@Uncivil_S @FoxHedgehog @JshRbnsn Big difference is unlike, say "social democrat", also used lazily, no-one actually identifies as one.
Not sure if #honestdoorstep or Cormac McCarthy novel. 
An equal parliament looks a generation away. @bspeed8 crunches the numbers: 
@Uncivil_S There's such a thing but it's been used as a catch-all descriptor to the point of uselessness.
Words that indicate a bad argument: "enterprise" - unless capitalised. "Neo-liberal" -  always. "Stalinist" - unless used historically.
A lot has changed since 2010, but I still can't get to sleep this close to polling day.
Labour would achieve a lot more with 56 Liberal Democrats than they will with the SNP.
It's easy - and fun! - to mock the Lib Dems but I'd prefer it if they were in government than not, on balance. 
"What would an in-touch Prime Minister look like?" fascinating #longread on David Cameron by @MatthewdAncona: 
Exclusive: Nigel Farage says you must vote Ukip. Exclusive? #GE2015 
@rcdavidsonuk @JonnElledge Very kind - my personal hope is this piece will be age very badly and very quickly, though.
@Fletch_Butcher @WDave2013 @montie This tweet looks a lot like a rehash: 
@sharpeleven You can complain about being patronised or you can do this "You said he was great!" thing but you can't do both.
@sharpeleven Yep - you seem to think "greatness" is about agreeing with someone, which it isn't.
@sharpeleven @Bonn1eGreer @CliveMyrieBBC So do you. We've been through this.
Unwanted flashbacks being triggered by @jimwaterson's story: 
British voters think the largest party should decide who governs but hate the LibDems. 
Whenever I see Cameron, jacket off, shouting, I get horrible flashbacks to my time as a waiter. #GE2015
@PaddyBriggs @montie @NewStatesman Indeed, as I say in the piece.
@WDave2013 @montie @NewStatesman I don't see how you could do that accurately TBH. Although people do do it.
@yatesyman @JonnElledge @georgeeaton I am actually feeling a lot more optimistic for writing that piece.
Last visit to New Broadcasting House under a Tory government? 
@simonk133 @matt_young Agree - I could have kept the theme of my series and headlined "Is Labour's VoterID wrong?" but I wanted the clicks.
@simonk133 I remember.
@helenlewis @c_crampton @lisatozzi @aljwhite @flashboy @hcjewell Guacamole, obviously.
"Dude, where's my swing?" Labour think they're losing. Are they right? 
Why it could be #Labour's information that's wrong,  not the polls: 
@ReubenS333 Hah - I should change back to my old profile picture, clearly...
@ReubenS333 Fair - my subsequent tweet was that it's fifty-six years since Tories won an majority without a state-educated leader.
@ReubenS333 Maybe you're reading too much into it and being unnecessarily aggressive? Another thought.
@nsdmorrison In practice, doesn't count.
#zing  
The Herald has found @JamieRoss7's white whale! 
Fifty-six years and counting since an Etonian won a parliamentary majority in Britain. #GE2015
A thought: it's forty-nine years since Labour last won a working majority without Tony Blair at the helm. #GE2015
2. Find your constituency
3. Consider every "bad vote" mark an endorsement

Chilling reminder from Neil Kinnock, via @georgeeaton: 
I'm on @BBCNews's Election Tonight for the last time tonight at 19:30! #tears
Brilliant @arobertwebb piece with a fantastic final paragraph: 
Beware the return of the shy Tories, Neil Kinnock tells @georgeeaton: 
Keep thinking back to the Lib Dem who told me that "The best of both worlds" would be a better campaign rather than "This shower? Really?"
I'm not sure of the benefits to a party that sees European deal-making as a Good Thing continually slagging off those it makes deals with.
"I'll scream and scream until I'm sick!" 
Analogy from a Labour candidate: bringing Jim Murphy in 2014 like "pulling a star striker from the bench in the 89th minute at four-down".
I've updated my #GE2015 watchlist to take account of new intelligence - and also to include Douglas Alexander. 
@KingofSW6 Indeed. But postal voting has been going for some time - may help Labour.
@DeeBeeFree 4:00.
@ChrisWimpress I didn't hear that one, will check it out.
@GOsborneGenius Agree.
I honestly cannot think of a non-awful interview she has given. But: Labour has been bossing the issue of the day for most of the campaign.
The two sides of Lucy Powell: on the one hand, Lab have been much sharper since she returned to the inner circle. On the other: bad on TV.
@samirashackle Cheers!
@alexhern Thanks!
@MartinBelam I can cancel my subscription. Also I don't think anyone's ever been beaten up because of a newspaper endorsement.
What will the DUP ask for in a hung parliament? Important analysis from @Ciara_Joanne: 
@Welshbeard @jessicaelgot @PaulbernalUK Yikes! Thanks for the spot. Will fix.
@SpinningHugo I didn't say it was a good straw.
This is my straw, and I will clutch if I want to: 
@rorymccourt Sorry, that was poorly phrased - I meant NZ First, which Tories think helped Key.
On a serious note, if Labour can pass their big stuff in 2015-6 and merely survive for four years, could get a majority in 2020.
Only the dead have seen the end of war.  
@Fletch_Butcher Yes, I saw that. Don't think it's relevant to an article about what Labour people are saying about Ashcroft data.
@Fletch_Butcher And? The point is Labour have been picking that anomaly up and Ashcroft wasn't - that's their wider concern.
@Fletch_Butcher What are you gabbling on about? Read the piece, then tweet.
#Labour shouldn't close the door on working with the #LibDems says @andrew_harrop: 
Red Ed's biggest mistake: not sharing a podium with Clegg during the AV referendum. Would have made illustrating coalition stories easier.
@jessicaelgot Very kind.
My big fear: Tories re-elected. People sincerely argue that Cameron taking his jacket off a factor. #GE2015
A little done, a lot still to do: @DCSrblin on the role of women politicians for @TheStaggers: 
Morning! Read this excellent profile of the battle for Bermondsey &amp; Old Southwark by @bspeed8: 
@rcdavidsonuk It was a definite meme. Doesn't make Tory stuff now any less ridiculous, of course.
@rcdavidsonuk I remember people said "They didn't win" &amp; arguing Labour should have stayed in office after 2010 during the leadership race.
@mistermaximus Yes, I remember 2014 well.
Labour people who have spent five years saying the Coalition "unelected" now having a tantrum about Tory complaints about "legitimacy".
@PaulStocker5 @Markfergusonuk Your guess is as good as mine.
@Markfergusonuk We all know NEC meetings ooze sex appeal. 
No question that Labourworld is jittery as hell. But, monoliths aside, the leadership has had a good short campaign:  
This is very good by @ProfTomkins - the SNP's constitutional leverage over Labour isn't as great as it appears: 
@DJSkelton Very kind. Could just be Labour's Wobbly Thursday though.
@James_Hellyer I think you've got to have a higher profile than I do to start all that.
@James_Hellyer Last week. 
I hope I'm wrong, but I think this could be the end of Walcott's Arsenal career.
I really hope the Telegraph endorses Labour, to see what Twitter would make of it. 
That's not "Unionism in crisis", that's Unionism. Oy.
If the SNP &amp; Labour rule Westminster that will be because of one referendum backed by 2/3rds of UK voters &amp; another backed by 55% of Scots.
@jantalipinski The karmic 3-3 is on.
@ianskenny No, it is but sadly beyond the reach of my laptop to fix...
Oh god, this is how it starts. #Arsenal
@LizSavagelabour @TheStaggers @bassmadman Had Labour further ahead than they finished.
If Labour can weaponise Crosby, could help them in the last few days: 
Forever in our shadow. #arsenal #StTotteringhamsDay
@JonnElledge I nicked it from @Alex_SkyNews.
@SamFawcett92 @NewStatesman Saving that for the liveblog.
Those lucky, lucky people. 
@DamianBuckley1 @JohnRentoul I don't believe so.
@FrancisWight Next to no-one; voters heard about it and the Liberals missed their target. Only Tim Farron took down Tim Collins.
@WJBarter Sorry, that was clumsily phrased - it should be amended now.
Anyway, we're at that stage of #GE2015 where everyone writes up the latest poll as gospel. Here's mine: 
As Liberal Democrats discovered in 2005. 
@jantalipinski @keiranpedley My nightmare scenario: Tories win and the "UNS is dead" people validated in one night.
@ashcowburn Cheers - hope you're well!
@antoniabance Argh: the curse of the run-on sentence.
@tmlbk @chrishanretty Not unreasonable, facing differences between pollsters, to suggest party ID a useful way to guess which is eighth.
@ScottA1971 And thanks!
@ScottA1971 No - equally Lab could be getting more negative feedback than is accurate - they've tweaked their methodology since 2010, too.
@chrishanretty That certainly wasn't my intention. Could equally be the other way round - which is sort of the point of the last line...
@ScottA1971 Because Ashcroft suggests a better result for Labour than their own information.
@chrishanretty Are there bias concerns in para 6 - I just meant the two sources are coming out with different things.
@GOsborneGenius They would be the challengers if the Ashcroft polls are correct - apologies if that's not clear.
@mrianleslie Can't get a good enough demographic sample, difficult to adjust for underrepresented groups, AIUI.
Part of my ongoing "Reasons to be fearful" series: Could Lord Ashcroft's polls be wrong? 
There's a divide between Labour's own information and Ashcroft's. It doesn't favour Labour: 
@adamboultonSKY @olibradley But how to account for continuing survival of the likes of Hughes, Beith, Cable, Farron against national swings?
@olibradley "If they're so high profile, do voters need to be reminded".
"The women united, can never be divided" @stephanieboland meets @SistersUncut: 
@James_Hellyer It's about how people react to the poll question as much as that, really.
@James_Hellyer You'd be surprised.
"Salmond is a master deployer of the dog whistle - &amp; knows the rats hear it too" - @chrisdeerin on magisterial form: 
@ScottA1971 Never underestimate how little attention the average person pays to politics, as the great man once said.
Hard to tell which is better, naming candidates or not. But Ashcroft numbers don't match where the parties are spending money. #GE2015
The thing about the "Brighton scenario" is you need to keep quiet about it 
@jenny_ricks @JohnnyCov Never heard the "more pandas than Tory MPs in Scotland" joke?
@jenny_ricks @JohnnyCov As for "browning", it's a sociological term - meaning is fairly self-evident &amp; I'm not bothered by it.
@jenny_ricks @JohnnyCov More than two. Evidently.
The kids are alright, red lines, and the world elsewhere: @timfarron's NS notebook: 
#honestdoorstep news (cc @craigawoodhouse, @richsimcox)  
#Swing60, on election night programming, is now on the iPlayer. Feat. me! 
@MikeJGWright @katieghose Had more to do with the unpopularity of the junior coalition partner than anything else.
@MikeJGWright @katieghose Not just that; but important to your point about minor parties.
@MikeJGWright @katieghose If a government  is an coalition between more than one party, it's not a government of 10 percent, but of 50-odd.
I would prefer it if @LibDemPress just added me to their distribution list, TBH. 
Miliband's approval is increasing even among his strongest opponents. Was "Fuck off Beaker" a few weeks ago. 
@MikeJGWright @katieghose That's sort of the point. (We have minority party rule as a norm in FPTP anyway, it's just single-party minority.)
It feels like the Monday before a foregone conclusion like 2001, not a paradigm shift in Scotland and who knows in England &amp; Wales. #GE2015
@MikeJGWright @katieghose They get four times the votes of the SNP, though.
@MikeJGWright @katieghose We have that now. SNP get 4% of the vote.
@JonnElledge Either that or test tubes.
@JonnElledge I live to serve.
A system at breaking point: @katieghose writes for @TheStaggers: 
Didn't the opposition do that?  
@AndyComRes Fair comment.
Re-up for my piece on Milibrand: good on Ed in seeking to widen Labour's tent. 
@clarky_7for19 He's not the sharpest tool in the shed, though, is he?
@simon3862 Agree.
If you do an interview with someone, and they endorse you, the interview is a success. Come on, this isn't complex. #GE2015
@itinerantgeoff @May2015NS Ashcroft may be wrong - certainly both Lab &amp; Cons think he's erred in Battersea.
Brand's rambling monologue subtle way of boosting Miliband. I've never been happier to see him. #GE2015
Six minutes into the Brand video. Beckett play levels of boring. #GE2015

Ukip running a very efficient campaign in Thurrock: 
@tyler_chinnick It means the electorate has more visible minorities in it.
@MsLesleySmith @georgeeaton They declare all the Doncaster and Sheffield council areas seats together, as I understand it.
@slunglowalan @georgeeaton Yeah, sociologists use it. Perfectly acceptable.
@j_coatsworth Yeah, sociologists use it - coined by William Frey, I think.
@JamesUndy1 Me too.
@rcolvile "Utterly authoritative if a little bit nerdy" is basically my life goal, much appreciated.
Norman Tebbit wrote in his memoirs that the Tory' 1987 campaign finished "on the ground where we were weak and Labour was strong". #GE2015
@rhodesjoshua0 Labour can probably "win" without it and Tories can lose with it.
@nmsonline @EllieCumbo I don't like cricket.
@KingofSW6 Not sure how accurate sampling like that would be but feels as if things are worse than expected for Labour on the ground.
#GE2015: If you're staying up, what's worth looking out for? My round-up:

Interesting temperature-taking by @SamCoatesTimes and @laurapitel in tomorrow's Times: 
We need a sixth pledge here...where are ya? Let's be having you! #delia #GE2015 
@SpinningHugo @DPJHodges Different areas - VoterID worked for Labour targeting strategy in 2010, Ashcroft is untested.
@ralpht9751 @FraserNelson I don't think an appalling record on poverty at Westminster excuses a bad one at Holyrood.
"There's life in the old party yet" - very good @Conorpope piece on Scottish Labour: 
@richardmarcj @davidbutler100 Depends on if you count NI.
280 seats, and Ed stays? This @PickardJE story suggests the nervousness from marginals is widely shared: 
Sunday train from Liverpool to London appears to stop at every marginal in England. Good for election nerds, less so for commuters.
I'm still waiting. :(  
@keiranpedley @jantalipinski @tnewtondunn Since beating us at the Lane: L5, D3, W4. Teams tend to lose steam after their cup finals.
@RobinMcGhee @davidbutler100 ...voting perspective their rhetoric locks them into voting with Lib-Lab in this scenario.
@RobinMcGhee @davidbutler100 From a policy perspective, SNP are a rightward shift from the Lib-Lab governments they replaced, but from a...
@Samfr D'oh!
@RobinMcGhee @davidbutler100 SNP are going to get 4% of the vote. Greens might get 6%. Lib-Lab might just get over that line, but still...
Second thought: under any other electoral system in Europe, the only viable government to come out of the election would be of the right.
A thought: this is the first election since the 1930s when the combined votes for Labour and the Liberals won't make a majority.
Striking thing about this article is the lack of any actual numbers: 
Meanwhile, somewhere in CCHQ, tempers flare. Why didn't they put the "no money left" note on a blue plaque? #EdStone
@RobDotHutton Of course not, I'm not writing science fiction here.
@HenryS050 No, I just think the stone is pretty funny.
@81beesfan Me neither. It's just a bit of fun, as they say.
Shadow Wales Secretary Owen Smith builds popularity as the only candidate who can move on from #EdStone. "That stone was dug in England!"
Leadership contenders quickly define themselves against the monolith. Andy Burnham takes an early lead on an "Everton not #EdStone" ticket.
Owen Jones blames defeat on #EdStone : "Instead of building an eight-foot monolith, Labour should have built a politics of hope."
Progress editorial: "Did Tony Blair have an #EdStone ? No. Do you know what he had? Three election victories. QED."
The Fabian Society issues a pamphlet on the defeat: "Pledge of stone, feet of clay". #EdStone
Future for #EdStone, 2: Labour defeated. #EdStone blamed. "It's the Stone what lost it!" declares Dan Hodges.
2020: Newly-elected PM Boris Johnson declares himself "the Edward Longshanks" of #EdStone, and refuses to return it to Labour HQ.
2020: Miliband defeated. Leaving Downing Street, he realises he has left #EdStone behind. "Wilson!!!" he roars.
2019: Miliband attacked by the left. "You get Balls!" he shouts at #EdStone. "Just like Two Cathedrals," he whispers to himself.
2018: Stewart Wood grows concerned that Miliband has carved an enemies list into the back of #EdStone.
By 2017, an unpopular Miliband takes to smoking in the Rose Garden. He uses #EdStone to light matches.
Downing Street staffers all claim, years later, to have been there, similar to the Stone Roses' first gig or Eric Joyce's punch-up.
Two futures for #EdStone: 1) ends up in Number 10. A celebrity Labour supporter urinates on it late one night.
Watch out! There are further tuition fee rises ahead; @ChukaUmunna writes for @TheStaggers:

@joe_oliver Tate Liverpool.
Troubling that everything now reminds me of the election: 
Can't show the art for copyright reasons. View from the window is almost as good. 
@ProfChalmers They released the sixth pledge late. To build excitement, I think.
@KateEMcCann Yes - it's very beautifully written. Like Stoner, with more war.
@mrdavidwhitley Betting tends to be a lagging indicator but seat-by-seat betting can be interesting if someone reacts to postal votes...
Cost of #EdStone will be wiped out when someone buys it at a fundraiser. Cost of two pledge cards? An organiser. 
A thought: a worse mistake in terms of money wasted to issue two sets of pledge leaflets, boards, etc than one eight-foot stone. #GE2015
@rcdavidsonuk @drjennings Would be nice if you'd read the article, where I make that exact point, first...
Al Gore declared victory in 2000. I don't expect that trick to work any better in #GE2015: 
@carlgardner Taking a week to form a government after a British election is not a constitutional "change" - long waits in the 19th century.
@carlgardner A fortnight period of transition between the new PM taking office and the old one leaving wouldn't be so bad.
Reasons why we should have a handover period in British politics: a week after being tired enough to commission an 8ft stone, you get nukes.
@popsider @GeneralBoles 100% real.
@MattChorley But all the Tories offer is scissors: for child benefit, for the NHS. #tweetlikealabourmp
Probably not an eight-foot stone, though. 
Pros: this will definitely raise more at a fundraiser than it cost to make. Cons: Just look at it. #GE2015 
@kindacromulent It's a stone with the pledges engraved on it.
Indeed. 
@GavinHJackson @sanderwagner @Pete_Spence Will, inevitably, through covering it, a) partially influence it, b) develop a view on it.
@GavinHJackson @sanderwagner @Pete_Spence Not going to vote in any of the internal elections that will take place after May 7.
@GavinHJackson @sanderwagner @Pete_Spence Sorry - was out. Dispute that not voting cleaner. Journalists are still going to form opinions.
@GavinHJackson Voting is literally the most uninfluential political thing I will do this year.
@GavinHJackson If political journalists didn't vote, could still influence outcome of election.
@GavinHJackson ...not because they vote. Should sports journalists hate football?
@GavinHJackson People distrust journalists because of pap shots, door stepping and, at the margins headlines like "Red Ed branded a liar"...
@GavinHJackson That take is too hot to handle.
@colizgg Gut reaction: that's awful. Second reaction: Labour MPs speak at schools segregated by gender all the time.
@colizgg I see it - I just don't know what it's of.
@colizgg Sorry, what *is* that?
All together now: Awwww.... 
Winner: the worst press release about the #royalbaby AND #GE2015. 
@Hielander Which is (arguably) good advice - but for £300k! (And not like this...)
@RealWitan Good sense of humour. Used to be a feature of dating ads in the 90s - so you're not an old fogey, just romantically successful.
Still mesmerised by this #RoyalBaby revelation from @helenlewis' column. 
@RossMatthewman7 Sorry - that was excessively ratty due to drip-drip of angry activists in @ feed these last weeks, apologies.
@sunspotandme Crosby's campaign not great but he's working on it 24-7.
@RossMatthewman7 Wasn't getting knickers anywhere. You were being rude yesterday &amp; today. Inform yourself maybe.
@RossMatthewman7 Previous musings where you didn't understand the electoral system or what "shy Tory" was.
@RossMatthewman7 Thank you for explaining my joke to me.
A lot of blue in this picture. Subliminal advertising by the Establishment? #madeuthink 
Hard to escape the idea that Labour paid a lot of money for some crushingly banal advice: 
I am also open to offers from prospective leadership candidates from any party. 
@Gary_Bainbridge You spelt "awesome" wrong.
@Ned_Donovan You can only sell your credibility once, but, equally, Arsenal only have one chance for a trophy this year.
Journalist, 25, seeks lobbyist, with tickets to the FA Cup and GSOH. (GSOH optional.) #journorequest

You weirdo.
Still waiting for an answer to #GE2015's biggest question. 
Just posted a photo 
@JackO_May Was @JohnRentoul: 
@ScottA1971 But for all the odd results, Con &amp; Lab ended up exactly where the national swing should have put them, numbers-wise.
@ScottA1971 Agree.
@ScottA1971 ...they still think they'll be fine. I  am leaning towards the idea that Ashcroft constituency polls might just be wrong.
@ScottA1971 Flipside: poll today suggests they'll be blown away in a seat they think they can win, have poured resources into...
@ScottA1971 Not just that - putting more resources into held seats, directing activists to targets that really ought to be bankers...
Nothing like a long train journey with a bad book (Butcher's Crossing).
This is good stuff from @ERSScotland:  
@Samfr My feeling is, if it is pessimism, both parties have spent a lot of money in some strange places.
@dlknowles Stop bullying Scotland.
@MVLibertas Will do better in Wales than people expect; seem to be running to set up beachheads for devolved elections.
This feels more consistent with what I'm hearing from Labour organisers than the Ashcroft polls. #GE2015  
@george_wallis And yet people say it's a boring election.
@olibradley I'm a history geek and short of rewatching a theatre premiere you don't get rawer than an election night.
I visited the Vale of Glamorgan and all I got was this constituency profile (feat @rafaelbehr): 
Rewatching 2010 election. Everyone keen to declare the death of uniform swing. In the end, bob on as far as seat share concerned.
Like the "g" in "gnome", the "civic" in "civic nationalism" is silent.  
@MuffinMark Is that a thing?
@colinrtalbot I considered doing a "or a ministerial car" but was struck down with prudishness.
Imagine if you tried to flash John Prescott. You'd be going home in an ambulance.
Clegg's failure to punch this guy means he is only the second best Deputy Prime Minister of the 21st Century. 
@ianjamesjohnson Sorry, that was clumsily phrased - I meant the best they could do is a poor third.
@technicalfault @julesmattsson Outside of Twitter, however, they have yet to kill a guy and get away with it.
@kv654321 @ProfTimBale I'm surprised how many people don't read the piece before tweeting...
@leobarasi Thanks, very kind.
The guys who crashed the car? Excellent piece by @ProfTimBale on Ed's tricky evening: 
Polls, summarised: Dawn has broken. Newness thereof TBC. #GE2015
@matt_young Tide definitely against Labour long-term. One strategist described it as "their last chance" to win it.
@matt_young Labour think it's marginal, have spent a lot and working it very hard. So do Tories.
"Back to Daltrey. What a loss to bricklaying." @chrisdeerin's @RamAlbumClub is a corker:

@ChairmanMoet Labour's genuine mainstays last time were so well-chosen I'm reluctant to back Ashcroft over them this time.
Bush does Wales, Part 2: 
Tories miles ahead in Battersea according to Ashcroft. Lab have it as dead heat, Tories say Jane E almost certainly gone. #GE2015
....that one way or the other, someone has made some bad calls.
There is a sufficiently large variation between where party officials are putting money &amp; where Ashcroft says they shouldn't...
@swearyexpat I was uncertain if you meant "registration" or "population". Asian vote tilts heavily SNP for the most part, too.
@swearyexpat You have missed my point. Postal votes are lower than expected since other elections *in Scotland*.
@swearyexpat Conversation didn't lead anywhere. You had a non sequitur which suggests you didn't really understand it. :)
@swearyexpat An entirely different conversation to my point about *Scotland*.
@swearyexpat Yes - have you? Seems somewhat of a stretch to suggest Rahman wouldn't have been able to do it without postal votes.
@jack_govier @georgeeaton It's a joke.
The promised end...or image of that horror? #GE2015  
@jamesrobking To referendum.
@swearyexpat Highest PV areas last time: Osborne's Tatton, Farron's Westmoreland. A sign of being good at politics, nothing else.
Or excitement about going to the physical ballot box?
Heard from 3 separate sources that the postal votes are not as high as they would expect in Scotland. Lack of enthusiasm for a WM election?
@BetterThanToday Well, which one of these would you feel safer pouring paint over? 
@matthew1butcher I read the interview - I meant more perplexed that it is "the" announcement of the day - where are the big parties?
@Tom_Mendelsohn @GavinHJackson Does happen as a result of arguments over rules, though.
If people want a three-way marriage, fine, it's their marriage. Perplexed about it as an announcement with six days to go. #GE2015
If you like vintage elections as much as me, make sure to watch #Swing60 this Sunday: a potted history of election programming.
@feedthedrummer No - we paid lip service to the extreme unlikelihood of a Labour majority and hoped for a Lib-Lab coalition.
@feedthedrummer We endorsed Labour in 2010.
Interesting to wonder what would have happened if Labour had followed @burdzeyeview's advice in 2011: 
"Breaking apart is not the answer: not in Europe and not in the UK" 
@jonathanshainin Think about the "wonderful" hot takes it would have inspired.
I really wanted the Guardian to double down on the Liberal Democrats. #GE2015
@gary_rae Supporting small businesses.
I'm in a coma, aren't I? That's what's going on. I'm in a coma. 
Better together? 
Farage complains about his poor income again. Poor Nige only has his MEP salary and TV appearances to keep body and soul together.
Farage claims that we "just send a cheque" to countries subject to foreign aid. Oy. #GE2015
@MParsfield @georgeeaton The methodology looks a bit suspect.
@georgeeaton I find the idea I should be spending that long thinking prior to each tweet somewhat troubling.
@stephanieboland I only had one breakfast today. #progress #stephenbushwinninghere

Thurrock, revisited: @AnooshChakelian at ground zero of Labour's Ukip crisis: 
@PeterKGeoghegan Would have to be Earl Grey, though, because all proper tea is theft. (Sorry.)
And on that subject, here's @David_K_Clark on top form on @TheStaggers: 
Eh, the wrong people were voting Labour. 
Strange goings-on in this week's tales from the doorstep: 
Today in the Times: @PCollinsTimes throws shade at @May2015NS. 
What really goes on "on the doorstep"? I reveal all, here: #GE2015 
@Dannythefink @May2015NS 2005 I had forgotten. Don't feel you can draw a line from 2001's spending argument to 05-06's.
@May2015NS Cameron &amp; Osborne matched spending plans - Howard wanted a tax cut. It's a myth.
What happened on the doorstep this week? 
Great response on the doorstep? Here's what the parties are facing out there: 
Scottish Lib Dem source: One element of Scottish Labour's problem is it sees the transformation of Scottish politics as solely about itself.
What really happened on the #labourdoorstep this week? 
@EmmaBurnell_ Very kind.
And it was delicious. 
No-one has replied to this tweet saying I'm not fat. I see. 
@HamishPringle Thanks!
@Johnothanjj It's a straw but I am happy to clutch it. (That sounded...untoward.)
@ProfChalmers The dating books have a name for this, I believe. 
So far, open DMs have not produced the telly appearances and Watergate-level scoops I had hoped for. 
The party that promises an end to press releases about "Twitter sentiment analysis", will get Soviet style coverage until the end of time.
"The outcome of this election is no clearer than it was before", says @georgeeaton of #bbcqt: 
@tomsperlinger No idea, I wasn't watching.
@dge1973 ...I can't control what people text to me. As I said in the subsequent tweet, could just be Labour paranoia.
@election_data I didn't say they want to lose. The Blair people feared defeat to Hague, for goodness sake.
But I think there's something within the Labour psyche that expects to lose, so who knows? #GE2015
On the unscientific metric of people texting me, Miliband got thumped tonight. #GE2015
.@labourpress and @CCHQPress in my inbox be like: 
Here's @AnooshChakelian's handy verdict on #bbcqt: 
Some useful responses, and @JeyyLowe. 
On a panel so not watching debate. Labour source texts "This is painful". Are they right?
This poster best enjoyed by singing "borrow" the same way Beyoncé says "Uh oh": 
The boss wrote about his hometown, Harlow: 
@notchrisevans @CPAGUK Yeah, that was a strange one.
@RossMatthewman7 Pollsters know it exists now and account for it a lot better, though.
This, from @CPAGUK, is more important than any endorsement: 
@RossMatthewman7 More accurate to say risk now is "unimpressed Labour"; doesn't want Cameron, really dislikes Ed, ends up staying home.
@RossMatthewman7 Shy Tory was the result of bad census data, it's not an ongoing phenomenon.
This, from @CPAG, is more important than any number of endorsements: 
@RossMatthewman7 Tories have to be four points ahead to "win". Much easier for Labour than DC.
Jason's first tweet! 
@RossMatthewman7 An effective tie in the popular vote - which is what the average shows - means a Labour government.

@nickhillman Congratulations!

Attack ads on YouTube, I'll miss you most of all! 
@gusbbaker @GTMelhuish ...a made-to-measure "solution"?
@gusbbaker @GTMelhuish Yes, actually. Maybe it would be a good idea if you'd looked at the Yes campaign at all instead of applying...
@gusbbaker @GTMelhuish It's about coffee mornings not policies.
@gusbbaker @GTMelhuish Community organising. Need to campaign like Liberal Democrats and recruit like old-fashioned trade unionists.
.@SeanKemp talking sense, as per: 
@gusbbaker Agree.
@gusbbaker It is the definition of a desk opinion that thinks that Scottish Labour's problem is its leader.
"Constitutional niceties are for parties that don't have their very survival at stake" - @JournoStephen  
I just used the phrase "better plan" to describe Labour's programme on air. Troubling.
"The tale of two cities is the reality of London": @andrew_adonis tells @timwig: 
Hunter Davies' column this week has the world's worst "Shag, Marry, Kill". 
@erika_benke Of course - I'm on stephen.bush@newstatesman.co.uk
@erika_benke I'm around pretty much whenever; more likely to be lucid in the early bit than later.
I'm on @BBCWorldatOne talking about our endorsement, which you can read here: 
Looking for your #GE2015 doorstep stories. DM/email me! 
@erika_benke Would love to, what time?
Putting together this week's "Overheard on the doorstep". Email/DM me! 
It's not so much "are the polls wrong?" as "which polls are wrong?" 
Labour agree with you, Natalie. Sadly no-one else does.  
For people who don't think much of the state, they give a lot of credit to the government:  
Labour quick out the blocks to piggyback on Danny Alexander's loose lips. 
@LouieWoodall I think it will be a Labour hold. But should I really be saying "I think it will be a Labour hold" anywhere but Scotland?
Labour's disability manifesto: why are disabled people an afterthought? 
@LouieWoodall The day I take my lead from betting odds....
What if the polls are just wrong? My take with one week to go: 
@tomwilson23 I meant what people are saying about their response on the doors.
@MrMikeBuckley Difficulty is that the different polling firms are disagreeing strongly...
@DanHeley1 Not measuring anything, just saying that it's hard to reconcile good polls with bad noises on the doorstep.
@DanHeley1 Not talking about marginal polling. Talking about anxiousness from campaigners in even the easiest gains.
@DA_E10 Marginals polling has been really badly reported. It shows what we'd expect, mostly.
@DA_E10 Labour won the ground war in 2010. Can only take you so far.
IpsosMori poll puts Conservatives five points ahead. Feels consistent with the fairly bleak noises being emitted from Labour in marginals...
How does the Labour disability manifesto do? 
Tory path to 323 gets narrower all the time; great story by @SamCoatesTimes &amp; @michaelsavage: 
@CFC_Clive Thanks.
Wonkish question: would the #SNP back Labour's proposals on the size of NewsUK? #GE2015
During indyref. I had a detailed conversation with a barista about central banking. They didn't know there were two Suns. Just saying.
@euanmccolm RIP your mentions.
Or: England or Scotland, the Sun backs the winner. #GE2015 
England or Scotland, the Sun backs the Establishment. #GE2015 
@3cambrai Typical lefty analysis, saying Tim Aker is having a good election.
@jamesrobking Am writing about just that tomorrow...
I'm on @Monocle24 at 10 past 10 talking about #GE2015. Tune in, etc.
@mr_s_wilder Tories? Sympathetic press, Mili's short campaign like one of those nice but pointless second leg victories for Arsenal...
@jamesrobking Agree - on the MP thing, depends who's left, doesn't it?
@jamesrobking My feeling is he isn't turning enough heads to be written up in a favourable way when he runs against Tim Farron.
@chrishanretty Yeah. A Ukip led by Aker with just Carswell would be...interesting to say the least.
@jamesrbuk Yeah, has done good telly and making good noises in the right places if the worst happens. Also Burnham's been quiet, so...
People having a bad election: Michael Fallon, Nigel Farage, Natalie Bennett, David Cameron, Norman Lamb.
People having a good election: Miliband, Umunna, Liz Kendall, Tim Aker, Miriam Durantez-Gonzalez, Sam Gyimah, Neil Findlay.
@ERSScotland Access denied. :(
@ShulemStern @CazenoveBLP I don't like FPTP - but would be easy for the candidates to stroll to victory/defeat and I'm pleased they're not.
You'd think after five years working with the Lib Dems they'd be better at making "Labour CANNOT win here!" graphics: 
"How did you follow #GE2015, grandad?" "Well, mostly I tried to reconstruct Tory announcements based on Labour rebuttal emails."
Considering it's a foregone result, impressed at how hard Labour, Tories and Greens are working in Hackney North.
@KrizleyWheatnik I'm seriously concerned. Scepticism about the Milibands is part of my personal brand.
@c_crampton You'll like this: 
You can listen to Miliband's @ClassicFM interview here. Very moving, brilliant music: 
I am finding being won over by Miliband a frankly unnerving experience. I said "Let Miliband Be Miliband" in the office today unironically.
Ferrari: "When you're sitting in Number 10, who is the first person you'll call?" "Why, you Nick!"
Also I hadn't heard this piece of music - the Queen Symphony by Tolga Kashif - before. It's very good.
@IsabelHardman @ClassicFM I wouldn't rule it out.
Moving and impressive performance from Miliband in his @ClassicFM interview right now.
On personal attacks: "The alternative is worse, which is a not free press," Ed Miliband tells @ClassicFM. #ge2015
@GoodwinMJ Fair. Odd because I assume - perhaps wrongly - that if Podemos were to be as right-wing as the SNP in office, they'd implode.
@GoodwinMJ Do they meet the conditions for radical left? (A genuine, not belligerent, question.)
Earlier: office puts the final touches to the NS endorsement. 
@TimGatt @georgeeaton Team Dave's preference is for a second coalition, AIUI.
@alan_p_martin Eeep - thanks!
Significant revelation in @georgeeaton's column; Miliband's preference is minority government: 
@robblackie_oo Cheaper and easier to do universally - breakfast the most important meal of the day tho.
@robblackie_oo I like the policy - I just prefer breakfast clubs.
@EllieCumbo I like it as a policy - I'd just rather have the breakfast clubs back.
This is a very good and lucid piece by @RobDotHutton that should make you very angry: 
@tmlbk @Birdyword I can't see either of them being able to get it past the triple lock.
Wonkish point: bad priorities to cut breakfast clubs for the poorest kids in order to give Tabitha a free lunch? 
@stephentall I find it more aesthetically pleasing than Lib Dem and I only have 140 characters to work with.
@dats In-Out referendum.
@nedsimons Still have to have a leadership contest which he has a strong chance of losing.
@gimpyblog Impossible to know how it plays with voters who aren't paying attention - ie most of them. Better for Labour not to find out.
If Clegg is gone, and Danny Alexander is gone, who's there to lead the Liberals into another Conservative coalition? 
@sianpenny @FelicitySlater What? Wirral South can keep her.
A MoneyWeek subscriber maybe? 
@AdamBienkov Out of interest, when was the last time you visited Scotland?
@SeanDolat Character limit. I've many wonkish objections with ACA but critics are invited to try being sick and poor in the U.S. in 2007.
@C9J Fair enough. I imagine it's revealing of ScotLab's ability to self-finance, as well.
"...and gone."
I wanted the headline to be "the Liberal moment has come" and the standfirst to be "PSYCHE!" but I was overruled.  
It can only be Labour: our #GE2015 endorsement. 
@C9J I hear that argument about Poles, too. People need jobs in Essex as well.
@BraidenHT @aldoreid Intriguingly, rise SNP support a closer indicator of referendum outcome than referendum polling in final weeks.
@aldoreid No - why would he? Cannot argue with 1000 activists in every seat.
@C9J Nigel Farage's wife is German, what's your point?
@aldoreid @BraidenHT Final YouGov aggregation before referendum (Aug 31) had party at 31 to 34.
@aldoreid @BraidenHT Jim Murphy was elected on the 13 Dec. YouGov put Labour at 27% to 47% on the 11th.

#ge2015 
Scottish jobs for Scottish workers. Nope, not sinister at all... 
Murphy was a dreadful Dfid Secretary but if you think Labour's problem in Scotland is about him, you're delusional. 
@youngvulgarian But *I'm* the one who's broken?
@GavinHJackson Impossible to tell how it willl come over to low-information voters. Better for Labour not to find out one way or t'other.
@bspeed8 Fair point.
Every day that people are talking about Brand interviewing Miliband is a day they're not talking about the Tories' tax policy. #GE2015
@SammyStevenson3 Thanks!
Only watching this in the hope Miliband will turn into the Hulk and smash up Brand's kitchen. #GE2015
What happened when Obama got elected, other than universal healthcare, huh? #milibrand
Zaphod interviews Arthur Dent. #GE2015 
Greens: why hasn't the media invited us to lunch?
Liberal Democrats: Neither Labour or the Tories can guarantee a prompt lunch. #fairersociety #strongereconomy
CCHQ: The election is a choice between the chaos of Ed Miliband's lunch arrangements and the competence of David Cameron. #GE2015
Red Ed branded out of touch as his interviewer revealed not to know when lunchtime is. #tomorrowspaperstoday
Giles Fraser thinks the verdict was Islamophobic. Here's someone who knows what they're talking about: 
It's the 20th anniversary of the new Clause Four. Here's the NS leader from that week: 
About that hopey-changey thing: 
Ahead of #Milibrand, here's what Russell Brand wrote on voting and politicians for the NS: 
@moniker42 Swings and roundabouts, I guess.

At this point, Labour surely has a better shot in Leeds North West or Watford than Glasgow East. Strange, but true. #GE2015
Labour has to ask itself whether the organisational capacity it has moved to Scotland would be better used elsewhere in the last days.
@Rachel_Bradley1 Sure thing S
@Rachel_Bradley1 Mostly - think I'm on Sky in the early hours of the morning but otherwise completely free.
I don't think I've ever felt as well-disposed to Ed Miliband as I do today. Good on him for trying. 
@danielelton Obviously not the worst thing they've done but the most insulting - how stupid do they think we are?
Even if it ends in tears, Miliband's attempt to reach out is admirable: 
@ShodanAlexM Yikes. Fixed, thanks.
Cameron risks undermining his message by handing out bribes at this late stage. #GE2015 
@RealWitan *shrug* For a policy to be worthwhile, have to be able to explain how to pay for it.
@EliotAndersen @youngvulgarian Liveblog. :(
@RealWitan Hell no. It's obviously silly.
@youngvulgarian Is it crazy to be the last sane one in the asylum?
I mean, seriously, this is one step below writing to every voter with a message signed "Hey, stupid face!" 
Hey, I just met you/and this is crazy/but here's a policy/so vote Tory maybe? 
@axlripley I'd forgotten that one.
@benglaze And even then I missed "loony".
@mr_s_wilder 
Thinking of doing a running tally of the things that Red Ed has been labelled. So far I have: Stalinist, landgrabber, clown and rug-burner.
@the_greygamer Apologies, which bits weren't clear to you?
This is beautiful and right by @rafaelbehr, every word: 
The limits of advocacy in the post-truth era. 
@RobDotHutton Would have been improved immeasurably if Miliband had said to Brand: "Do you bleed? You will." though.
Or FrostyNixy as I'm going to call it from now on.
.@hugorifkind talking sense on Milliband and Brand. 
Trailer rating: Not as good as Force Awakens. Better than Batman vs Superman.

@jantalipinski If he starts visiting safe Labour seats in Wales, I'm running for the hills.
@EmmaBurnell_ Gulp.
@JonnElledge I'm gonna get me a restraining order.
Ed M appears to be making his way across the exact same seats I've visited in recent weeks, in the same order. Is he planning to kill me?
@JonnElledge You do have similar hair.
@JonnElledge I reckon in Season 2 they'll make you darker and edgier, though.
What do other countries make of #GE2015? Not a whole lot, it turns out: 
This is rather sad. 
The establishment always wins.  
@arrest_bankers @georgeeaton No; pretty much all the Liberals' resources are being flooded into Lynne Featherstone's seat, I'm told.
@alexhern Is it too late for me to shotgun "Castro's Not Dead" as the name of my band?
We've got the full text of @ChukaUmunna's speech to Usdaw conference on @TheStaggers: 
Between Sarwar at Dfid and Alexander at the FCO, Labour's Foreign &amp; Defence team is going to look *very* different after May. #bbcdp
@CllrTomHayes Yes. The reason why he reminds me of teachers from the East End is, well, he's a teacher from the East End. Still freaky.
Vernon Coaker: impressive but reminds me very vividly of many teachers at school, which I find unsettling. #bbcdp
Cognitive dissonance: growing tired of the election. Very excited about the mayoral selection:

Things that have hurt the Tories in 2015: 50p tax cut, Ukip, low-wage growth. Things which have not hurt the Tories: not showing "passion".

@robfordmancs It's only 2% of the country, though. Barely a bigger swing than Hague got in defeat.

"The Conservatives? They're well-funded. They've got that guy, Lynton Crosby, I'm not sure if that's an asset." Ed has got his groove back.

Wheeling out John Major "looked desperate for the simple reason it was desperate", says @ProfTimBale: 
In the most anti-Ukip event of the short campaign, Ed Miliband is at a North London theatre talking about international development. #GE2015
@TomChivers Gah. Should be fixed now, thanks!
@jameschappers He seemed even more relaxed about relegation than Tim Sherwood.
.@MORGANMEAKER talks to the winners and losers in gentrifying Brixton: 
@Sean_Kemp Is taking backhanders from Boden?
@TheTomMunson @RichardCann76 Has told the House of Commons and the Independent he doesn't follow football. That's it, the end.

Sorry.
I suppose if you've got a Tin Man and a Scarecrow, you might as well have the lying. 
@BaredJustice There's only so much small talk I can take.
@xtophercook Embarrassingly I just had to look up who scored Arsenal's second goal last year. (It was Koscielny)
@faisalislam He has to distinguish it from rugby football. Because he's posh. #classwar
@harryreid1985 I was being facetious.
"Every time the media herd changes course, it overshoots." @JohnRentoul: 
@sevanslux Yes - how do you think the story started?
@sharpeleven @UndercoverMutha Has he overseen a radical transformation in education, yes or no?
@andyc0706 I was using it ironically.
David Cameron describes Villa as "snug in the middle of the table". Umm... #murnaghan 
"I'm going to pass up the opportunity to talk about my football team" Yep. Sounds like something a real soccer fan would say! #murnaghan
@helenlewis Hard to deny.
Actually I bet Cameron is one of those people who enjoys school reunions.
The PM's enthusiasm for this interview: one below "hostage video". Slightly higher than "school reunion". #murnaghan
@sharpeleven @UndercoverMutha That isn't really what I said: 
"Ed's increased confidence" + "He's eaten his ReadyBreak" + "Red Ed" = punchline that is upsettingly just out of reach #GE2015
Ninja'd. :(  
This new PMQs format is rubbish. #marr 
@Partyreptile A minority government propped up by votes from outside isn't constitutional crisis, it's just constitutional.
Ed Miliband really channelling Tony Blair today. Surreal but nice, as Hugh Grant once said. #marr
Ed Miliband arguing for a Third Way. Huh. There's a  thing. #marr
@Partyreptile Bombs are unlikely to start going off in Scotland or England.
Kickstarter to make sure Ed Miliband never uses "Conservatives" and "sprayed around" again. #marr
@Partyreptile No more a constitutional crisis than 1974 or 2010. Or 1995 or 1977, come to that.
@talktoharris1 @ChloeChallender Even that's cray-cray. No more a constitutional crisis than 1974, 1995, or 2010.
This MoneyWeek article is the worst thing since the abdication. No, I take that back. The worst thing since creation: 
@AlastairMacIver ...the trenches and what would have happened if the Cuban crisis had gone wrong.
@AlastairMacIver Yes; he later told his son that he only had nightmares about two things...
@GeneralBoles Take that back.
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say the Cuban Missile Crisis may have been a worse crisis than Red Ed in Downing Street.
Things that have happened since the abdication: World War Two, the credit crunch, the Cuban Missile Crisis. 
@Bwanger88 :(
@danielelton Unite is the only one where change could come from above. Change from below, however, much more widespread.
@danielelton That "backed by unions" part looks a little shaky in Scotland.
@danielelton I think they were speaking colloquially.
@jackcevans @Markfergusonuk That's not why the SNP are ahead though...
@jackcevans @Markfergusonuk Why? Their success in May not due to their record in Holyrood...
I'm a ray of sunshine. 
.@timwig talks to @andrew_adonis about Nick Clegg's FT interview: 
@jimfraser That only works if Labour get enough seats in England and Wales for the two parties together to have 323.
@jamesmaxwell86 @NewStatesman Was in print originally and I had to cut words somewhere, apologies.
@Aidan_Kerr1 Thanks - I feel the "1000 activists in every constituency" point hasn't been grasped in rUK yet...
@drjennings Yes - it was fantastic. Really skilful weaving in of the exposition, too.
Me, in a cheery mood: what happens to Labour if the Tory campaign works? 
Like the "D" in "Django", the "and Unionist" part is silent. #GE2015 
The terrifying thought occurs that I may want to be a Villa fan on the 30th May.
Cut through! Someone find a dead cat and throw it on the table, quick! 
Important journalism arguments at the NS, as rows break out over who will post the Cameron clip online.
"I like that Benteke," said Mr Cameron. #GE2015 
@Stoicalist Not particularly useful to describe a party's voters as on a left-right axis; confuses more than illuminates.
I would also preferr it if people supported West Ham to Manchester United, to be fair: 
This is very good by @SamCoatesTimes on the success - and the limits - of the Tories' anti-SNP strategy: 
This is very good. It's the @RamAlbumClub, isn't it always? 
@SpinningHugo Indeed. In this case: C 10, L 12, B thereafter.
One for the "Ukip helps Labour" crowd. Which number goes up as Ukip's has gone down?

No vote, no voice: @LrVrrl meets the EU migrants who are unable to vote in #GE2015: 
Must admit, I thought @GriddleOctopus's simmingGreen manifesto would work out better than this 

@jackcevans @bspeed8 @AnooshChakelian What a waste of taxpayers' money.
@patrick_kidd @David_Waddell Byrne and Hammond are friends, AIUI, so a particularly low move from Laws.
You had five years to think of a joke response and you came up with this?  
This is very good from @Ciara_Joanne: why Sinn Féin's manifesto matters, but not for 2015: 
@mrhwilkinson Haven't been in coalition with Labour for close to a decade now. Regardless, I don't see KW as having the same status as Wood.
@mrhwilkinson They're fifth in every poll for both devolved and national elections. KW very impressive but just don't think they qualify.
@mrhwilkinson I said people were upset about a fading language. People in Newport are upset about immigration, doesn't mean it's happening.
@mrhwilkinson a) I didn't say the Welsh language was "withering" anywhere in the article.... b) Note the phrase "major party".

Follow @MrBrendanCox, who is tweeting the latest developments on #RestartTheRescue.
@kirstyjmcneill @montie Thanks, very kind.
@danielelton Indeed. Was thinking about how Labour seems unable to contain radicals like the younger Straw, Blunkett, etc within its walls.
@Will__Lord Thanks!
@danielelton Thanks! And agreed; part of a broader failure to trust local government.
The kids are alright: 
@MVLibertas Regardless; campaigned for a system where this eventuality a known possibility.
Hot take: if you campaigned for Scotland to remain in the UK and against AV, can't complain when the SNP wield power at Westminster.

@leftoutside @kadhimshubber Really? If someone wanted me to stop making fun of their nose or their job, I would.
@kadhimshubber @leftoutside I don't think that objection becomes unreasonable until death.
@kadhimshubber @leftoutside Should someone ever have to see their design on a Nike trainer? I'm not convinced.
@kadhimshubber @leftoutside Depends: is the artist alive?
@kadhimshubber @leftoutside Not reasonable to use patent protection to stifle rivals or to deny research findings to policymakers.
@kadhimshubber @leftoutside I think the "reasonable man" is important here. Reasonable request to say "don't use my poem on this advert".
@leftoutside Swerving the creative control. Why should the DWP be able to use my poem on a poster?
@kadhimshubber @leftoutside Intangible to you, maybe. Not intangible to artists who don't want the government or Disney to use their work.
@leftoutside @kadhimshubber It would also lead to the appropriation of art for purposes the artist doesn't wish.
@leftoutside @kadhimshubber Okay, but at that point the argument you're against rent-seeking is a little shaky.
@leftoutside @kadhimshubber Agree. The artistic point which you're swerving however &amp; is completely left out by this policy, less so.
@leftoutside @kadhimshubber And there's the broader Springsteen/no you cannot change the ethnicities of the characters in my book point..
@leftoutside @kadhimshubber The one person, however, is already the least well-paid.
@leftoutside @kadhimshubber Discount supermarkets are great if you don't work in them.
@leftoutside @kadhimshubber That would allow Sony to make a film of Mortal Engines *next year* without paying the living author.
@leftoutside @kadhimshubber A fairly huge gulf between duties being paid to the long dead and 14 years.
@kadhimshubber @leftoutside That a system helps rent-seeking doesn't necessarily mean the alternative isn't worse.
@leftoutside The use of the phrase "extracting rents" to refer to the average author or designer is just head-exploding.
@leftoutside This *is* clearly terrible policy.
@leftoutside And unsurprisingly the people going "Eh? What's the problem?" are not people who rely on their back catalogue to make a living.
@leftoutside It is a handy explainer of why being an undiverse party is terrible for policy making.
@leftoutside Thank god that under a Green government, Chris Christie will be able to campaign to Bruce Springsteen.
@leftoutside Fuck writers and fuck their backlists, I say. Fuck graphic designers. Fuck artists.
@RossMcCaff Would give my eye teeth to have been in the pitch meeting for this.
"Woah! Someone's ordered Schweppes! Step aside, we've got a real alpha male here." 
@LeightonVW @drjennings Of course; Miliband obviously under-valued. My big regret was not bundling on the SNP early.
@duncanrobinson Where's my rifle?
@LeightonVW @drjennings No, indeed. All I would need to do is bet in February.
@LeightonVW @drjennings In this case they are responding to the trends of February in April, though.
@MVLibertas Stoke Newington. Where actually all of the parties are working very hard.
@rcolvile That feels like a more legitimate complaint to my eyes.
@MVLibertas At my desk.
I've decided my least favourite tweet of election season is "No sign of party in distant second place in my safe seat". #GE2015
It's the seats, stupid. @georgeeaton helpfully explains our electoral system for the hard-of-thinking: 
@GavinHJackson Which I think may be where the idea that they outperform polls comes from?
@GavinHJackson ...in by-elections there tends to be a bit of movement after the postal vote comes in, for instance.
@GavinHJackson Yes, I know. My point was that in some cases you possibly could have tracked results better using *individual* bets...
@FlipChartRick @GavinHJackson Almost everyone. Our election site has all of the various models here: 
@GavinHJackson In indyref, actual number of bets was pretty even but odds for No much tighter because of the bigger amounts put on it.
@GavinHJackson If people bet lots on a distance outcome after a while the betting market will change to protect the bookmakers' odds.
@FlipChartRick @GavinHJackson Anything we know about voter behaviour? It's just UNS; not enough Liberal survivors, etc.
@FlipChartRick @GavinHJackson Method hasn't been updated. Seriously I cannot  unrecommend it enough.
@FlipChartRick @GavinHJackson Electoral Calculus is like the Political Compass: hasn't been updated for yonks, effectively useless.
@GavinHJackson Yeah; although there is of course the distorting effect of people playing long odds &amp; trying to make a profit.
@GavinHJackson Even predicting swingback - most forecasts have it built in - the betting markets have been out of whack.
"John is John." 
@adrianmcmenamin Polls put Ed clearly ahead as far as governing majorities are conceited.
@adrianmcmenamin Even so, the betting is following the polls.
@gjrhopkins Exactly; but a periodic claim is that bookies' odds are a better indicator than polls.
@MrHarryCole @georgeeaton If you have a working majority in the Commons, you don't need to "test the water".
@GavinHJackson Implied probability on Miliband over Cameron has been higher than that based on polls for some time.
That old saw about betting markets outperforming polls, handily debunked in a single chart: 
@PickardJE @ChairmanMoet But there isn't a leftward shift in any of those and on social issues they are arguably to the right.
@dhothersall @PickardJE I meant the "the polls are wrong", "ground game" people.
@robfuller91 @PickardJE Polls show they are behind on overall contact but ahead on face-to-face, which studies show more effective.
This, from @PickardJE's visit, is what should really terrify Labour in Scotland: 
@PickardJE @ChairmanMoet You do have to ignore all the BES data to make that stick, though.
@mrdavidwhitley Lib Dems have explicitly ruled it out. No reason both can't vote the same way on confidence motions tho.
I believe this disease is called "arithmetic". Will they ever find a cure? 
.@FiveMinuteEcon watched the #bbcdp economic debate so you didn't have to: 
@hughosullivan People don't care about places they don't represent is his argument. Which is a strange one for any party.
@RealWitan Yes; my point is that the (flawed) logic cuts both ways.
I may have written off these posters a little too early: 
Not many people are surprised by tweets the they scheduled themselves, but I am one. 
From Cameron's Speccie interview. Appears to concede that he doesn't care about Northern cities. Bold. 
My piece from the magazine on 1974-79 is now online:

Ed Milband's interviews have gone from entertaining 5-4 defeats to grindingly dull 1-0 victories.

@rosieatlarge It's a great prize!
@AbiWilks @mrdavidwhitley Point 1 applies solely to the fact of who she's married to. Not like the kitchen, where obvs relevant.
I'm on BBC News at 7:30 talking about the election and all that. Watch it and you could win a prize!
@AbiWilks @mrdavidwhitley ...where people are wives of, mothers of, etc., etc.
@AbiWilks @mrdavidwhitley 1) because people have a right to a private life and 2) because it aggravates a problem in the culture...
@AbiWilks @mrdavidwhitley As far as I know, stories about the latest Hopkinsism don't mention who she's married to, nor should they.
@AbiWilks @mrdavidwhitley That's an issue with Vine; not an issue with Gove.
@AbiWilks @mrdavidwhitley Or don't know anyone with a partner with awful views? Firmly of the opinion that guilt by association is bad.
@AbiWilks @mrdavidwhitley You've never been in a conversation where someone's said something you disagreed with?
@AbiWilks Plenty of leftwing politicians' partners have unsavoury opinions. People's partners aren't a mirror into their soul.
@mrdavidwhitley @AbiWilks This, completely this.
@AbiWilks Also, if  whenever I've done a profile of a constituency, find split households.
@AbiWilks Violet Attlee was a Tory. Mary Wilson was a Liberal.
@AbiWilks If she wasn't married to Gove, would still be angry about a columnist calling people leeches. Therefore: irrevelant.
Emotions associated with the parties. 
@EmmaBurnell_ Me too; but that visibly isn't the only denouncing happening.
@garypepworth I see that as a bar to be cleared rather than something to emulate.
I find the idea that Michael Gove is responsible for Sarah Vine's comments somewhat dark. Should she get line clearance from him?

"We don't trust the Electoral Commission at all!" William Dartmouth doing wonders for the reputation of Ukip MEPs.
"We've got the fifth largest economy in the world, the fifth largest military budget" says Philip Hammond. Britain: a Europa League country.

Excellent timing.

"I'm very flattered to be confused with Jeremy Hunt," says Hammond on a recent poll that found most people can't recognise him.
Hammond: "We've replaced Labour's sofa government with a proper National Security Council." And the world has never been safer!
Watching the @daily_politics foreign affairs debate. I though Douglas Carswell was meant to be on, what happened there?
@harperga Everyone's at it.
@JazzTehara @brolezholloway Eh?
How do the manifestos rate for BME-friendly policies? @brolezholloway does an audit: 
@SophieWarnes ...of Ryan Coetzee's campaigns in South Africa because at least they don't need new plans for that.
@SophieWarnes ...so I wonder how much they've just shrugged, decided they won't get a fair hearing nationally &amp; run a carbon copy...
@SophieWarnes The thing is their organisational strategy is good and makes sense, is being worked very hard...
Brilliant advert for Ukip, the SNP, Greens, et al from the Liberal Democrats here: 
@brighton_alan There are three Scottish Doctor Whos. One SNP, one Labour, one non-aligned. #nerdknowledge

.@SMFthinktank analyse what #snpmanifesto means for Labour's spending plans. Not a whole lot: 
Continually unnerving to me how much Annabel Goldie looks like David Cameron from the future. 
Something very surreal about getting an email from CCHQ with a speech by John Major.
@mkeirle I doubt it. SDLP and DUP both a factor for Labour, too.
My prediction for the 2015 election: it will end austerity...for Northern Ireland.
On @TheStaggers: why Nick Clegg is a can of beans. @rosieatlarge: 
Miliband makes a habit of this. It's going to end with one of his Special Branchers shooting a hen, isn't it? 
@richdhw The number of relaunches that he had, eesh. Also a massive neocon.
@richdhw Well, yes. Lovely show but I don't get why it's become a lefty dream to fall over, do little &amp; then let the Tories in.

@Aidan_Kerr1 Eh, I doubt it. Probably crippled with debt, if that helps.
@owencorrigan @AbiWilks @RupertMyers Oh, you meant the Tory campaign? Yeah, that's awful. I thought you meant the 4% point.
@owencorrigan @AbiWilks @RupertMyers I agree that English votes for English laws is an awful idea though.
@owencorrigan @AbiWilks @RupertMyers Didn't delegitimise London MPs that the capital voted Labour in 1951, 1955, 59, but govt was Tory.
@AbiWilks Not at all. My guess is, like Quebec, nationalists will dominate in parliament but fall short in referendums.
@AbiWilks My feeling is: I don't think the SNP's argument is primarily reality-based so unconvinced it makes all that much difference.
@AbiWilks One way or another a lot more Labour or Conservative voters are going to be completely ignored.
@AbiWilks The idea that a government has to include 4% of voters to be representative feels specious to me.
@AbiWilks Awfulness of FPTP point: 45% is a funny definition of "almost all".

@RobDotHutton @chrisdeerin How can you tell? I think 10 to maybe 14?
@chrisdeerin Child to au pair, who is becoming more French-accented the more invasive the questions become.
Paxman-style gruelling between au pair and child on the 38 bus: "Are you sleeping with the fat boy?"
One of the people in this "Coalition of chaos" leaflet is in coalition with Cameron right now: 
@AdsoMenk Better. Would have less of a Ukip problem, some more Tories.
@alexsau1991 It has been a massive hitching post on the road to independence.
@alexsau1991 Tories had 16 seats at Holyrood in 2007 and them helping the SNP a vital part in proving that party could govern.
@alexsau1991 Semantic. Neither party going to become separatist as a result.
I've blogged about the ComRes polling about Coalition partners: 
@alexsau1991 Cameron approved of working with the SNP until 2011.
@alexsau1991 @David_Cameron SNP are not a "hard left" party in any shape or form.
@alicmurray But SNP politicians are competent, hardworking, charismatic, good on TV. English Greens, less so.
@JohnRentoul Thanks comrade.
David Cameron to Britain: "I've been held to ransom by Nick Clegg for five years. Please vote for me." Umm... 
@alicmurray It's true; there is more in common there than any of the other manifestos.
@alicmurray Most of the SNP manifesto *is* the Labour manifesto though.
ComRes finding that large % of voters don't want SNP in government confirms my story on Tory thinking from March: 
@peopleman44 Agree - I think there may be issues with sea depth but not sure.
The thinking behind this is somewhat sinister... 
@Twinoni2 @sparkyhamill Works both ways: whose constituents do you do right by, yours or someone in Holyrood?

@DPJHodges @May2015NS @MrHarryCole Did you read the piece. Merely that it's statistically highly unlikely.
Right-wing commentary, 2015: the rugby lads suddenly realise the boardgamers are winning the SU election: 
@mrianleslie Thanks!
@DPJHodges @May2015NS Nope, even then. For Cameron to have enough seats needs to repeat 2010 showing, which is very unlikely.
@DPJHodges @May2015NS Sure thing, w/e Dan. I am definitely the one with no grasp of the numbers here.
@DPJHodges @May2015NS No, I'm not. 100% behind the May2015 analysis. Ed M must be considered the overwhelming favourite.
@alexhern Time Out.
@DPJHodges @May2015NS @JakeBenRichards @georgeeaton Yes. Highly likely the Tories aren't far enough ahead.
After, Ed berated his aides: "We had the perfect answer to 'why stand against your brother?' the whole damn time!" 
@DPJHodges @May2015NS @JakeBenRichards @georgeeaton Sure, if Labour are on 32%, and the Tories on 40%, no Miliband government. Have a star!
@DPJHodges @May2015NS @JakeBenRichards @georgeeaton ICM has them on 34% and 10%.
@DPJHodges @May2015NS @JakeBenRichards @georgeeaton 309.
@DPJHodges @May2015NS @JakeBenRichards @georgeeaton Actually, it is enough. You can have your opinions, you cannot have your own facts.
@guardian_clark @May2015NS Phone polls actually picking up more and more mobiles all the time now.
@DPJHodges @May2015NS @JakeBenRichards @georgeeaton Yep. Still a 4-point increase in the Labour vote on 2010, which means Tory losses.
@DPJHodges @May2015NS @JakeBenRichards @georgeeaton More accurate to say it's "very, very unlikely" that DC will be PM in that case.
@sparkyhamill Agree, but: imagine you're an MP for a South East marginal. Whose job do you look out for, yours or an MSP's?
Come work with me! Well, near me. 
@A_B_Evans Very kind.
Leverage: you're doing it wrong. 
My take on #snpmanifesto: a document written from a position of weakness. 
@Pidge As I understand it it's an overall target; point of the manifesto is to be rather broader than hitherto.
Exclusive: @GeorgeFoulkes writes to Hammond calling for an immediate restoration of rescue operations in the Med: 
@Conorpope Pint this evening, Y/N?
@gusbbaker Agree; that was sort of the point of the last line. I just felt it was the subject for Another Blog.
@aireyj No-one wants to build "unaffordable" homes, though, so it's a wash.
Oh good, @alexmassie has written a more elegant version of my blog. Maybe I'll float under the radar: 
RIP my mentions. :( 
The SNP: electorally strong, politically weak. My take on #SNPMANIFESTO: 
What's wrong with tax avoidance? @markrowney lights the blue touchpaper on @TheStaggers: 
@JuliaHB1 The "millions of other families" is contained in "median".
@JuliaHB1 Agree fulltime work is great; less so if people are actually poorer as a result of doing so.
@JuliaHB1 ...that has nothing to do with "low expectation". That is just maths.
@JuliaHB1 Two people on *median* income will have the second earner's salary wiped out by childcare costs...
@JuliaHB1 Point is people don't manage: are pushed into rent arrears, debt, don't see children, etc.
@JuliaHB1 Obviously unreasonable to compare as if jobs are like-with-like. I don't do any heavy lifting in my job; can work longer.
@JuliaHB1 You've also forgotten lone parents. As has the DWP, but still.
@JuliaHB1 If those numbers added up, then not at all. But the reality of childcare costs, etc is that they don't.
Grim on the impact of the latest change to to the Universal Credit: 
Labour launch their disability manifesto today; David Blunkett blogs @TheStaggers: 
Labour's campaign looks to be lapsing into bad old habits. Today is the start of NHS week, &amp; also the launch of their disability manifesto.
I enjoyed writing this tweet a little too much, truth be told. 
@DanHannanMEP The limits of 140. Agree broadly, but there's that whole generational differences in turnout factor.
@paulica44 I didn't say anything about race: demographics cover class, interests, occupation, and age.
Admittedly, seeing as 99% of the "why should I register to vote?" thinkpieces are written by middle-class white blokes, this isn't too bad.
If you don't register to vote, it's not just yourself but everyone with your demographic profile who you're screwing.
@glassdevil No, you in it? I'll see if I can find an old copy.
What can be done about food banks? @frankfieldteam &amp; @JohnGlenMP blog for @TheStaggers: 
Karen Joy Fowler's fool-proof method for whether you should go out with someone: 
@May2015NS @CJTerry It gets worse. At one point, he suggests that bookmakers' odds shift public opinion.
@AdamRamsay At least "six Tory gains in Scotland" is stupid in a conventional way, though.
MoneyWeek's understanding of what a market mover is bodes well for their chosen field: 
Today's #honestdoorstep winner:  
@WillardFoxton @DPJHodges Facebook is a scary place.
More mind-boggling stupid analysis from MoneyWeek: 
@WillardFoxton @DPJHodges  Neal Lawson, Gruan. "In hindsight the wrong people were voting Labour" 
"This is possible, but it can't be considered likely" - @harrylambert1 on Cameron's vanishingly small path to 323: 
@hocwatch @David_Cameron @AVFCOfficial Eh, you should see the other team. ;)
Aston Villa a lot like Cameron's Conservatives: looked promising 08-10, now somewhat forlorn.  
@twlldun Sort of. It does feel like it breaks the unwritten rules to me.
@twlldun She's still a minister. Executive continues sans legislature.
.@timfarron blogs for @TheStaggers on #RestartTheRescue: 
@albiondumsday @mattzarb Yes; I think Matt was referring to Liberals in '79 as well, although their vote actually went down from '74 then.
Thanks to Ed Miliband I now have Enrique Iglesias' Hero stuck in my head. I'm voting Tory: 
@HarryAEvans Know it's a bit apples and oranges but just found it a bit bleak.
@HarryAEvans Ashcroft found 29% thought he would be the best PM, admittedly in a larger field, and YG puts his approval in mid-20s.
@mattzarb As with Ukip and Tories, just because you voted one way in 1979/2010 doesn't mean that you would have stuck around in 1983/2015.
@mattzarb But crucial point is that it wouldn't have gone to Labour; on forced choice SDP defectors favoured Conservatives.
@mattzarb SDP may even have helped Labour in preventing a 1931 style share of seats.
@mattzarb Actually the SDP point is a widely-held but untrue point; actually wouldn't have changed the result.
Sigh. Margaret Thatcher in '79 - considered too unpopular to become PM  - so much more popular even than BoJo now. 
@alexhilton @sundersays Indeed; Labour MPs, who don't seem to figure in your thinking, much less opposed to PC than SNP.
@IainDale Burnham would "get the majority of the union votes". Mebbe, but don't forget that Ed abolished the electoral college.
Is Alan Shearer a TPA plant to erode sympathy for the licence fee? It would explain an awful lot.
I have a terrible feeling about this game. #arsenal
@alexhilton @sundersays Labour would split badly if Ed tried to ditch Trident. May yet split over renewing it too.
@alexhilton @sundersays You are flatly wrong. PLP and membership would split badly.
@alexhilton @sundersays Understand that; but that's no more plausible than Labour backing Farage. Seriously.
@alexhilton But not at all feasible, so...
@alexhilton Sure, but no constitutional reason why I couldn't be PM in a hung parliament. Just not going to happen; ditto your idea.
@alexhilton Neither 1931 or 1918 really work as counter examples although 1918-22 was more of a genuine coalition than 1931-39.
@alexhilton Gladstone came second in votes and seats; took office with the support of Irish nationalist groups. 
@alexhilton 1892 would seem to.
@alexhilton Feels like something of a misnomer to treat those Labour MPs as distinct from the rest of the National coalition.
@alexhilton He didn't become PM in 1931 - he had been since '29.
