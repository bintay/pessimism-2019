Yess so glad #stalker is back on tonight. I love this show its my fav @StalkerCBS @CBS @DylanMcDermott @MiraSorvino
I cant wait for this weeks episode of @UltimateFighter #blackzilians @blackzilians @ufc #UFC
I just watched @E60 on @espn n it was about @TurnerSportsEJ n I just have to say Ernie is a great man n real inspiration to all.
@Just_Oh_Susanna beautiful
The Hunt fight shud be stopped. He showed a true warrior spirit n a big heart but this added punishment isnt good #UFCAdelaide @danawhite
WOW @RJWhittaker1990 with a quick n impressive 1st rd knock out of Brad Tavares #UFCAdelaide @ufc @UFCFightPass #MMA @danawhite @Jon_Anik
The only thing more beautiful then the Island scenery in the down under is the lovely n beautiful @swayzevalentine :) #UFCAdelaide @ufc #MMA
@MattBarrieESPN its obvious Jerry Jones n the @dallascowboys dont care about the criminals they bring to the dallas community. No class
Hell yea the UK Monster @RealChopperChi strikes again with another impressive 1st rd KO baby!!! @GLORY_WS #GLORY21 Hes the real deal!!
Mike is the luckiest man alive having the beautiful @rochelladeville as has lady @AmazingRace_CBS #AmazingRace
Congrats @KNegandhiESPN on getting doctorate from @TempleUniv Thats a great achievement!!! Congrats #DrNegandhi @espn @SportsCenter
#TeamBlackzilians all day baby!!! ATT was lucky @Tyrone_spong didnt clear out that whole locker room lol @blackzilians @UltimateFighter #TUF
I would love it if the @Giants pick up @BIrvin_WVU11 cuz he's n amazing player/teammate n wud be the perfect leader for the #Gmen Def #NYG
@jaymee looking beautiful like always today on @SportsCenter @espn
@Bose these are awesome
@espngolic ur not a bad or a thief n at least ur honest n haters gonna hate. I know I wuda done the same thing cuz 80 mill is life changing
@Espngreeny I wud def take Curry first cuz he can score at will then Harden cuz hes a great leader with lots of skill then Griffin dunk king
@MikeAndMike @Espngreeny @espngolic if @FloydMayweather fights @GGGBoxing n beats him I'll gladly say hes the GOAT but he wont fight him
@jaymee looking very #beautiful this morning on @SportsCenter @espn ur smiles light up the tv screen :)
@aldridge_12 come play for the @Lakers and be part of a championship team. #LakersNation @JeanieBuss @MagicJohnson
If @FloydMayweather is retiring after his next fight then he better fight @GGGBoxing to prove he's the best ever. No more ducking Golovkin
@FloydMayweather ran away more then he stood n fought. A real fighter tries to end a fight not run away n squeak out a decision #BoxingDied
@Sara_Walsh @BramESPN I like Dortmund n Frosted n my Longshot is ItsAKnockOut cuz the owner is Chris Mara of the @Giants #GMEN #KyDerby
@b_petty14 went to the wrong NY team. @Giants will regret not drafting him when they see how great he does. Cruz n Odell wuda set records
@nflcommish plz bring the #NFLDraft back home to #NY where it belongs next yr n every yr after @nfl @ESPNNFL @NFLonFOX @nflnetwork #NFL
@BramESPN @Sara_Walsh @espn @SportsCenter thats who I like too
@BramESPN @Sara_Walsh who do u guys like for the #KentuckyDerby2015 ? @espn @SportsCenter

Come on @Giants pick Bryce Petty with the 74th pick plz plz plz cuz we do need a future qb n he can do it #NYGpick #NFLDraft #BigBlue #Gmen
The @Giants shud have taken Randy Gregory or Bryce Petty with the 33rd overall pick #NYGpick #NFLDraft @nfl @ESPNNFL #BigBlue #NYG #Gmen
@GGGBoxing would beat @FloydMayweather and @MannyPacquiao  and it wouldn't go to a decision but they too scared of him #MayPac #Boxing
@Giants imagine Bryce Petty with his amazing arm just airing it out deep down the field to @TeamVic n @OBJ_3 they'd set @nfl td records #NYG
@TheRealNiaMoore how about I fly out there n we meet up a the lil wedding chapel n have Elvis marry us lol :-P u going to #MayPac fight?
@TheRealNiaMoore where you flying to? I hope u have a safe n fun trip boo xoxo
The @Giants shud draft qb Bryce Petty with the 2nd rd pick. Eli is getting to the end of his career n Petty will be a great qb #NYG #BigBlue

@LunaLanieee beautiful!

The @Eagles n chip kelly need to chillout they just signed Tebow n Bradford so they shudnt be worrying about Mariota #NFLDraft @nfl @ESPNNFL

@ShelleyESPN u look amazing and I'm so happy n glad to see u back to work on @espn @SportsCenter
The @Browns shud make a offer to TampaBay n give them Manzel plus their 1&amp;2rd pick for the first pick. Manzel n Mike Evens have a connection
@McShay13 plus theres also the connection with Geno Smith n Kevin White that they both played at WV @wingoz @ESPNNFL #DraftRoomSim
I predicted 2yrs ago that @TeamKhabib will be champ. Hes got a will that wont be broken n my prediction will come true! @ufc @UFCONFOX #MMA

@WhiskeyNSweetum that Sheldon Silver guy was made to step down cuz ge was corrupt n now a new guy with no ties to the union ppl will take
@WhiskeyNSweetum get legalized in ny he wud deny them cuz hes friends with the head union guy so it was like a big F U to the ufc but now
@WhiskeyNSweetum the main guy was friends Sheldon silver who was the guy in charge of making or passing bills in ny n everytime mma tried to
@WhiskeyNSweetum their food n beverage employees but they wudnt so they dont get along n stuff n the food n bev union is based out of ny n
@WhiskeyNSweetum The owners of the ufc The Fertitta brothers also own casinos in vegas n the food n beverage union wanted them to unionize
@WhiskeyNSweetum yea they are n the reason its not allowed here has nothing to do with fighting or the ufc its bullshit
@WhiskeyNSweetum yea I'm in ny. MMA will be legal here with in the yr hopefully. We're the only state that don't allow it
@WhiskeyNSweetum @ufc hahaha I'm the same way lol if i am doing something n i know theres a fight that night I stop what I'm doing to watch
@WhiskeyNSweetum i can go to one. How much do tickets usually go for? See if I was out there i wuda bought u a ticket so u cud go with me
@WhiskeyNSweetum oh ok gotcha. I've never been to a live @ufc fight before cuz they dont allow mma in my state but hopefully that changes so

@KerimO1234 I'd go with Nelson I think Reem will come out fast n gas out quick n then Nelson will take him down n get the tko #UFC185 #MMA
Wow what a great finish to the #AEPlayoffs @UAlbany_MBB with a 3 pointer wit 2.6 sec left to take the lead n win baby @ESPNCBB #MarchMadness
Lets go #Danes beat Stony Brook!! @ualbany #Greatdanes @ESPNCBB @espn
@MeganOlivi May I ask you a question?
@KerimO1234 who u thinking of putting money on Reem or Nelson?
@serenawilliams that was a great n loud ovation for u yesterday :) Ur n amazing beautiful goddess n I got nothing but love for ya girl :)
How about those @OregonMBB #Pac12Tournament #pac12hoops @ESPNCBB
Hell yea how about those heavyweights Harper v Arreola throwing bombs tonight that was awesome lol #PBConSpike @jimmysmithmma @AntonioTarver
@WhiskeyNSweetum yea but the Murray loss hurts a lil lol
As much as I hate to admit it the @buffalobills are a qb away from being the best team in the @nfl @ESPNNFL @criscarter80 @HermEdwardsESPN
I hope @IamTheImmortal smashes @JohnyHendricks tom night! #UFC185 @ufc #MMA
I'm pumped for tom night's fights n can't wait to see the #ShowtimeBrothers @Showtimepettis n @sergiopettis destroy their opponents #UFC185
@CarlaEsparza1 looked amazing at the #UFC185 weigh ins today @ufc
I just seen local beauty @Chelsiearyn on the @BoomerandCarton show today. @cc660 @7BOOMERESIASON
@WhiskeyNSweetum yea thats true plus they didnt really do anything on the def side either. The Giants haven't done anything besides a rb
Wow Bill Walton is shot I'm listening to him during the #STANvsUTAH game n hes out there he must of taken peyote too many times lol @ESPNCBB
@WhiskeyNSweetum so what do u think about all nfl free agency thats happened so far? Its looking like Philly may take the east.
@WhiskeyNSweetum @TheNotoriousMMA @ufc @UFC_Ireland @UFCONFOX haha I don't think Aldo will be able to withstand Conors Caliber of striking
I can't wait for Sat night to see the great @Showtimepettis to put on another great performance n win! #UFC185 #ufc #ShowtimePettis @ufc
I can't wait for @TheNotoriousMMA to be crowned the champ!!! He's gonna smoke Aldo @ufc @UFC_Ireland #IrishPride @UFCONFOX #MMA
I'm watching the amazing #SuperEMT @NightwatchHolly do her thing on #NightWatch @AETV :)
@ashleytisdale haha I love youuu :-*
@DezBryant I wish u played for the Giants. Imagine that Sex Bryant Victor Cruz n Odell Beckham Jr that wud be the ultimate wr core ever
Well the @Giants will finish last in the #NFCEAST this season cuz they're the only team not improving their roster or addressing their needs
@Espngreeny #GoodAdviceIn4Words @espngolic @MikeAndMike @Giants need offensive linemen
@AdamSchefter whats going on with @RayRice27 ? Is he playing this season? @nfl @ESPNNFL
@TheRealNiaMoore you can go code red on me any day boo lol Im watching u kill it in the dome against wes n Teresa :) @TheChallengeMTV
@BobArum @trboxing @HBOboxing @stanverrett what the world really wants 2 see is @FloydMayweather fight @GGGBoxing to see whos the lb4lb king

@braymanmatt @NightwatchHolly Holly is n amazing gorgeous woman
The @Giants REALLY NEED to pick up sum offensive linemen n they shud go after Nick Fairley n Antonio Comartie but emphasis on O Linemen #NYG
Wow Sara on @HellsKitchenFOX is absolutely #beautiful @GordonRamsay #hellskitchen
@Giants we need a better offensive line!! The #GMEN are successful when Eli has time n protection in the pocket so better o line = more wins
@RVacchianoNYDN @PeteTheGreek13 @Giants need a better o line if they wanna win. When eli has time n protection in the pocket they win games
Wtf @Giants we dont need another rb what we really need is a better O line cuz we won't be successful unless Eli has time in the pocket #NYG
@PatrickWillis52 if you don't mind me asking why are you retiring? I wish you great things for the next chapter in your life.

@D_flower_power @WrestleChatNet I agree 100% hes still gonna party n hes not sorry for using hes only sorry cuz ge got caught.
@WrestleChatNet @D_flower_power the UFC shouldn't let him fight until he completes 30 days in a rehab. Hes tryin to bull shit everyone

@CanesFootball @MiamiHurricanes @GoldenAl I hope u all watched Ohio St celebrating! Next yr that cud be #TheU so lets get it boys! #Canes
@KirkHerbstreit @criscarter80 I'd say @OSUCoachMeyer has a tuff choice to make at the qb position next season lol @OhioStAthletics @ESPNCFB
Hey I gotta give it to @OhioStFootball they def earned this championship with over coming adversity n never backin down #OREvsOSU @ESPNCFB
The refs are quick to throw flags at Oregon but I seen 3 dif holds on Ohio but the refs dont throw any flags? #CFBChampionship @NCAAFootball
Lets go @WinTheDay time to make them pay for these turnovers! #NationalChampionship #OREvsOSU @ESPNCFB #CFBChampionship #QuackAttack
@Univ_Of_Oregon really needs to start capitalizing on these @OhioState turnovers if they wanna win the game @WinTheDay #CFPChampionship
#AskDana @danawhite whats up with @CarlosCondit when is ge fighting again n against who? Hes a serious contender for the title @ufc #MMA
@danawhite I would rather Lawler fight Diaz or GSP
@danawhite is the UFC any closer to getting into NY for fights? #AskDana @twitter

@sam_ponder how are the @Univ_Of_Oregon football facilities? From what lil bit I've seen on tv it looks awesome there @SportsCenter @espn
@NBCSN he dont deserve to be in the Hall. If they let Barry in then they shud let Pete Rose in
The @nfl acknowledges that the refs shuda called PI on dallas but it still dnt change the fact that they stole the @Lions superbowl chance
@stephenasmith Amen I'm so glad u put @RealSkipBayless on blast about being a hypocrite on the refs pickin up the flag when it shuda been PI
I just read an article for a chance to win tickets to the Super Bowl thanks to NBC! Visit: 
I just watched a video for a chance to win tickets to the Super Bowl thanks to NBC!

@KNegandhiESPN U showed the available HC candidates on @sportscenter 4the Bills n I saw Frank Reich on the list wasnt he a qb in Buff b4?
@only_Khanh I know right. Everyone thinks its ok to carry guns n shoot cops. This shits gotta stop
@lindseyvonn is a true inspiration to all!!! She don't know the word quit n not even back to back injuries didn't stop her. Shes back on top
Another 2 #NYPD officers shot tonight. Ridiculous
@danawhite @FOXSports1 thats a quick turnaround for @Cowboycerrone n especially against a very tough opponent in Bendo but Cowboys the man
@RowdyBec hey Bec do u have a fight lined up yet? If so whos ur next opponent?

@CNN @CarolCNN Explain what a fair trial is? Obv Tsarnaev's guilty but dont they have to pick jurors who havent heard about it in the media?
@SNFonNBC if the owners move the @STLouisRams to LA thats jus wrong n evil taking it away from the STL fans. Oak shud be the LA team not STL
@NdamukongSuh Ima BIG Fan of urs n I really wish n hope somehow u sign wit the @Giants cuz ur amazing player n wud bring so much to the team
@HannahStormESPN The refs didnt call the penalty for PI &amp; Dez on field w/no helmet is cuz Dallas is refs fav team n more popular then Det
@RobinReneDoan I jus watched #48hours n my heart broke for u n what u went thru. Ur a strong inspiring amazing woman n My prayers are with u
Yess I'm so glad #Galavant starts right tonight :) I been waiting for this show to air @GalavantABC @ABCNetwork I hope they keep the show to
@RealSkipBayless it shuda been over but the Refs picked up the flag n didnt call PI n the @Lions wuda scored n been out of reach for dallass
Well the @nfl Refs stole that game away from the @Lions if they called that PI the Lions wud have finished that drive with a td n wuda won
@WhiskeyNSweetum @nfl @nflcommish @NFLonFOX I def agree with that lol they change the whole momentum n flo of the game. Its a nail biter tho
@WhiskeyNSweetum @nfl @nflcommish @NFLonFOX I didnt see the play I must have been outside with my dogs but I seen the PI play they picked up
The @nfl @nflcommish need to do somethin about Refs always helpin out the cowboys with favorable penalties or not callin penalties @NFLonFOX
Lets go @Lions beat those pretenders today!!! We all know who the real  @dallascowboys are #CHOKERS @NFLonFOX #WildcardWeekend @nfl @ESPNNFL
@Missdollycastro I know u hear this all the time but u are perfect!!! Ur seriously the most beautiful woman walking the Earth!!!

@Cowboycerrone u have nothing to be sorry about bro. U made us all proud by going out there n getting the win! Great Jon bro #UFC182
I think Cormier's nose got broke in the first rd n its making his breathing laboured @joerogan @danawhite #UFC182 @dc_mma #MMA @UFCONFOX
Jones is looking a lil tired n moving slow I think #UFC182 @danawhite @ufc #MMA @UFCONFOX

@SportsCenter @espn how does a break away plain Jane slam dunk get to be the #1 top play on #SCtop10 ? There's nothing special about it WEAK
Great story by @CariChampion on @CameronNewton on @espn @SportsCenter the struggle only made him stronger &amp; the man/leader he is today!
How about that one handed td catch by James Washington in the #TicketCityCactusBowl #SCtop10 @espn @SportsCenter

@sam_ponder is just way too beautiful! Her hubby is the luckiest man on Earth but if for sum reason it dont work out I'm always here Sam :-)
@nflcommish @nfl Since no one knows for sure 100% that @NdamukongSuh did it on purpose that he shud be fined, not suspended for the big game
If @nflcommish n the @nfl don't let @NdamukongSuh play this weekend then that shows they want dallas to win. It looked like a accident to me
@dc_mma not much longer bro Jus think in 4days u can put ur hands on Jon n even better u can put ur hands on ur @ufc belt when u win #UFC182
In my opinion @CjAndersonRB9 is the best running back in the @nfl if he started week 1 he'd lead every RB this season. @ESPNNFL @NFLfantasy
@JennIverson wow whos that beautiful woman on the left lol :-P
@Blafell1 just got his incentive with that 25 yard catch. Congrats Brandon u def deserve it after the great season you've had!

@feliceherrig amen sista!!!
@djnos7 @NFLfantasy like I said I'd go with Fleener he n Luck have a hood friendship n seems to be going to him more often now
@djnos7 @NFLfantasy I'd go with Fleener but Kelce could have a good game too plus I think hes been Smith's fav target all season so its tuff
@randamma that was a sweet arm bar I've never ever seen it done like that before that was awesome n congrats on ur win @UltimateFighter @ufc
@damienwoody looks like he could be playing again. He looks so good he could prob even play as a linebacker lol @espn @SportsCenter
@steelers screwed me out of a few points n a win this week in my fantasy league
How about those @CanesHoops with a great comeback n win against the #5  @GatorZoneMBK great way to start the season 2-0 @ESPNCBB #TheU BABY!
I have a great idea why dont the @Giants n the @ChicagoBears make a trade @mrojaycutler for Eli Manning I'd be happy with that #BigBlue #NYG
@D_flower_power yea tough game but they'll bounce back n go on a roll into the playoffs
Every @Giants fan shud sign a petition for the #GMEN to get rid of Eli Manning lol but seriously #BigBlue needs to draft or trade 4a good qb
When will @Giants understand that Eli Manning is the weakest link on the team? Draft or trade 4 a good qb already.  @Jaboowins wud work #NYG
@KylieJenner guess what????
@TeamKhabib whos your next fight against and when?

@NHLBruins whats wrong with Rask?
@NakedAmateur it wont let me follow anyone sorry. U have a lot of great pics of beautiful girls :)
@Support PLZ HELP ME!! This is the second time in a week messaging u guys about it. It won't let me follow anyone. Its been goin on 4 3weeks
The @Giants need to pick up @NdamukongSuh n draft @Jaboowins then use the rest of their picks on O line or make trades for better O linemen
Y cudnt @Giants make that deal with @Seahawks instead of the jets for @Percy_Harvin ?Cruz is out n he cuda filled his spot for a 6th rd pick
@khloekardashian I love you too lol
Dam Diego Ferreira's one lucky guy I was jus watchin CountDown n it showed his beautiful girl @FitSweetCheeks lol #UFC179 he'll win for sure
@Giants need to think about the future like @Colts did with drafting Luck So if the @Giants wanna be successful they will draft @Jaboowins
HELL YEA @keselowski needed to win today n he did! This is Brads year @MillerLite @NASCAR #BlueDuce #ItsMillerTime @ESPNNASCAR #SprintCup
@LeanneMacco whats the thing u added me to?
Im so pissed at Andrew Luck cuz hes not even throwin the ball to the Reggie Wayne for the second week in a row @Colts @nfl #NFL #ColtsNation
Millions of @Giants fans want the Giants to sign @NdamukongSuh #SuhForNYG #BigBlue #GMEN #WeWantSuh

Dam look at Nikki hanging around in those booty shorts :-P she looks soo good Cal is a lucky guy lol @utopiatvusa #Utopia #UtopiaArmy
If @Giants can pickup @NdamukongSuh in off season then draft @Jaboowins with their first pick then draft all O linemen they'd be unstoppable
I called it back in the #wildcard rd that it wud be a #WildCardWorldSeries #SFvsKC @MLB #PostSeason @BBTN @Royals @SFGiants winner in 6games

If the @Giants want to win games they need to upgrade the O line n also Eli shud use Larry Donnell like Brees uses Jimmy Graham #NYG #Giants
Well I was in 1st place in my fantasy league until @DangeRussWilson @Percy_Harvin @Trey_Deuces @Nukdabomb all shit the bed n I lost by 5 pts

Congratulations to @MikeSamFootball for getting drafted into the @nfl by the @STLouisRams #NFLDraft staying in Mizzo @ESPNNFL
The @Giants need to get the #1 draft pick for the 2015 #NFLDraft and take Jameis Winston cuz we really need a qb now n for the future #NYG
Why didnt the @Giants take Michael Sam? The guy was first team all american n I dont know how hes not drafted yet! #NFLDraft @nfl #BigBlue
@NatBerhe welcome to the NY Football @Giants we look forward to seeing u out on the field. #BigBlue #NFLDraft @nfl @ESPNNFL #NYG
How beautiful does @suzykolber look today at the #NFLDraft #NFLDraft2014 @nfl @ESPNNFL
@_spill_ hahaha that's awesome lol
Great pick up for the @AZCardinals taking @Lthomas_3 with the 120th pick. I have a feeling he's gonna be real good in a cpl yrs #NFLDraft
I guess @Giants dont care to fill the TE position. I personally think they shud have picked @TheGreat_Lache cuz he can catch n run the ball
I really think what ever team ends up with @Lthomas_3 will be quite surprised with his skills. #NFLDraft @nfl @ESPNNFL
@BishopSankey will be the @nfl rookie offensive player of the year this season coming up! Hes a tank n runs thru people #NFLDraft
Lets get it Des Green!!! Put in the work! #Bellator119 @BellatorMMA #MMA #BellatorMMA
Dumb move by the @buffalobills trading @StevieJohnson13 to the 49ers They wuda had the greatest receiving core in @nfl history. Fuk da 49ers
The girl in the jean shorts on the  #runtoOldNavy commercial where their in the spa is drop dead gorgeous with amazing eyes n smile @OldNavy
@Espngreeny @espngolic I think Jax blew it by taking Bortles wit the 3 pick cuz I guarantee he wuda been available in the 2 rd @MikeAndMike
Congrats to @teddyb_h2o going to @Vikings n I wish the @Giants took him cuz hes gonna be a great one!!! #NFLDraft @nfl @ESPNNFL

@OBJ_3 welcome to the New York Football @Giants brother!!!! Great pick #NYGPick #BigBlue @nfl @ESPNNFL
Its looking like its gonna be a Texas A&amp;M streak right now in the #NFLDraft with 3 A&amp;M in a row if #CLEPick johnny Manziel @nfl @ESPNNFL
Wow I can't believe the @jaguars took Bortles with the 3rd overall pick. They cuda got him in the second rd #NFLDraft #JAXpick @nfl @ESPNNFL
I really hope the @Giants take Johnny Manziel or Teddy Bridgewater with their first pick cuz we need a great qb for the future #BigBlue #NYG
How amazing does @serenawilliams look in this months Fitness magazine :-) she's a goddess!!!
@NBAonTNT @SHAQ @TheJetOnTNT how old is Hibbert? When I watch him play its like ge moves like a elderly man. @Pacers @NBA
@Lakers shud hire @MarkJackson13 He did great in GS plus he has a good relationship wit the splash bros so when they hit FA we cud sign them
@MikeAndMike #GrillGolic now that GS fired Mark Jackson do u think he'd be a better fit as Knicks coach then Kerr since he played in NY?
Im watching #TattooNightmares n this girl Megan is getting a cover up over this tattoo of 2 dogs doin doggie style n wow shes so beautiful
I think @Sausagekingtat n Matty are the best artists and I'm tired of hearing Scott talk himself up. What a tool!! #InkMaster
I just seen the face of a angel @taniaganguli on espn reporting from Houston on the Texans :)
#GrillGolic Y does @Espngreeny touch his ear piece every 15 secs? @MikeAndMike We have a game take a sip of coffee everytime lol @espngolic
If the @warriors don't bring back @MarkJackson13 then I think Phil Jackson n the @nyknicks should hire him as head coach

@Sublimemind9 @MikeAndMike @Espngreeny @espngolic dnt get me wrong what he said was horrible n all im sayin is lets find all the facts first
@Sublimemind9 yea but we dnt know the context of the convo. Maybe his gf was cheatin on him with AA man n thats what he was talkin about
@J_theRevelator they dnt even know the context of the conversation.  Maybe his gf cheated on him with AA man n thats wat he was talkin about
The coaches for #UltimateFighterLatinAmerica is Cain Velasquez n Fabricio Werdum #MexicovsBrazil @UltimateFighter @UFCTonight @ufc #MMA
#AskTheMikes what ever happened to innocent till proven guilty? @MikeAndMike @Espngreeny @espngolic this has turned into a witch hunt.
Stuff Sterling said was wrong but let the attorneys find all the facts first. Every1 needs to relax n let the judicial system do its process
@MikeAndMike @Espngreeny @espngolic what if sterlings gf got caught cheating wit a AA man n that recording was him getting it off his chest?
@MikeAndMike @Espngreeny @espngolic it seems like everyones on a witch hunt after Sterling what ever happened to innocent till proven guilty
