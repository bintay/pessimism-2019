A big #THANKYOU to @LIMEJamaica for responding to my plea, today after 4 I receive a call from one of their contractors...#positiveoutcome
Though it's easier, its best to #EXPLAIN your anger rather than #EXPRESS it!
My respect for you all have been seriously #diminished! No tolerance for such behavior regardless of who they are...#nonewhatsoever
NOTHING BEFORE ITS TIME!!! PATIENCE BEING EXERCISE HERE
Where did this headache come from?
Sometimes you have to let go of what's #precious to receive that which is #priceless
You can't keep running from your past, one day you'll have to face it no matter how bitter/horrible it may have been #faceit!
Forget my birthday twice in a row...who are you kidding...uhuhuh I will still be pissed at you #Temptations
Do not compare yourselves with your other counterparts...its dangerous to do such thing...remember even in life we mature at different ages
I know you didn't...this coke out man a call mi "friend"...its such a pity such beautiful years of his life is being wasted
You lied, steal, cheat...and now you think we should make amends!! Don't test me, you wouldn't like the outcome!
Whatever time we spent together it wasn't a waste for me...I was never a liar I was 100% honest but the evil in you couldn't hide anymore!
Its true I trusted you with my dreams and heart...however I'm not foolish enough to trust you ever again!
@LIMEJamaica services needs to be addressed...in the mornings its an atrocity
@LIMEJamaica it took me roughly 15minutes to send this tweet...hence I am experiencing a NETWORK problem
@LIMEJamaica seems to have start back with the problem and frankly I'm peeved! Seeing that I'm not alone I will take it easy...a few issues
It you're being rushed into a decision and you feel uncomfortable able it, leave it at the alter God will make the way straight for you
Don't be hurried in making life altering decisions#takeyourtime
If they have to hide you or the relationship...then probably there's nothing there to begin with...love allows you to exonerates each other
Anytime you find yourself doubting a job, relationship etcetera and you have a valid reason to #wait #watch and you'll see the outcome
In order to survive in life be open to criticism..your belief and faith will be interrogated.
To remain relevant in today's world you have to be up-to-date with current affairs...
If it seems too good to be true...it probably isn't true!
You never know how strong you are until all you have is #your own strength to rely on...#strengthintimesofweakness

Be happy with who you are and what you've got...life only offer you one chance, live it to its fullest!
From the womb to the tomb....
Its not who you're looking to for help, but who God will bring into your life #favour
Who is guilty of this? Whenever you miss that special person you re-read every conversation you had with them... (raise hands) I am guilty!
When you're talking to the person you want...everyone and everything is #irrelevant!
Whenever you have a problem go to the #THRONE not the #PHONE!
In life you need to learn to accept the apology you never get

I don't get the big hullabaloo over Obama, he won't spend a full day here! And its said a private key would pick him up at the airport!!!!
Unwanted pregnancy is different from an unwanted child...the pregnancy is unplanned and unintended...not the child!
I thought I needed you...truth is you needed me more. You take, take and take more. Look at what you've left me with?!
Be around people that brings out the best in you...not the stress in you
You should never love anyone more than yourself
I recently learned that the phrase do not be afraid appears in the bible 365 times...one for each day.
You'll live a far more productive life if you give less attention to everything people have to say about you
If you have a special talent something that sets you apart from everybody else...use it or you'll lose it
Lots give me strength...this child shove jumbo wax crayon in her nostril!!;!
Theory only gives you knowledge but, practice place you ahead in the lane of experience!

Companies that are slack and offer poor customer service should be held accountable @LIMEJamaica and you are one such company
If I was using the services I would be charged...but the fact that #YOU @LIMEJamaica are at fault shouldn't we be compensated?! Not with you
How can @LIMEJamaica be having a technical problem which disrupts both internet and calling services...yet as a customer I'm not compensated
I got the steps to use and I used them and explained the error message I was receiving and that was it...no follow through @LIMEJamaica
The last time I got really upset message you as you said on January and only a small part of the issue was solved @LIMEJamaica
See this is what I'm referring to...I am to send a message a about the problem...look where this will get me...
I don't need anyone to message me to ask what my problems are...they are plain @LIMEJamaica try resolve rather than ask the same thing over!
@LIMEJamaica you need to do better and not worst....you are losing customers, its such a pity
Everyday the same problem and nothing has changed...network block data service not working and this annoying recording @LIMEJamaica PSSSH
Waste of precious time, you get  Reps that are inadequately trained &amp; unfamiliar with what your talking about, how can this be @LIMEJamaica?
From last month I've been having problem with my data service and even sometimes network problems I have called @LIMEJamaica customer care
I planned to switch as soon as I purchase a new cellular phone.... @LIMEJamaica doesn't respect or care for their clients
When I just switch data service and started using @LIMEJamaica I made the WORST mistake possible....they are unprofessional and incompetent
@LIMEJamaica is getting #WORSTNWORST!!* I have called tweet Facebook all my growls and I am at my wits end
Don't be! 
Today I rise!!!!
Not because a crayon is broken means it cannot be used...similarly a broken heart can learn to love and trust again
You are God holy and righteous!
Oh Lord sometimes you wanna help some people but how can you when they have not asked????
If we keep looking at how far we have to go...we will never be able to appreciate how far we've come! #youvecomealongway #appreciateit
What seperates man from God is the fact that they are  consciousness of their sins...what separates God from man #nothing!

There are some things that #only in tears you can bring them to God #Heunderstandyourtears

He is Alpha and Omega I will #trustHim in my transition!

Praise God I'm free, @LoveFMJAMAICA @NadineABlair .....good old time gospel on the Sunday afternoon
The internet on my #mobile isn't working properly @LIMEJamaica...this is tardy and disrespectful.
Tonight marks another night @LIMEJamaica wants to get mi #crass!
Everyday I'm working on becoming a better me...#everyday
I'm sure I've covered everyone 
Don't give thanks only when you have, give thanks when you have #nothing! #appreciation
I am never given back MB but as soon as the plan expires,I am being billed for it @LIMEJamaica whether MB used up or not!
I trust @LIMEJamaica value each customer and for these disruptions I think compensation of some sort should be dealt put to those affected?
@LIMEJamaica one thing I know for sure is that whenever this happens and it does a few times too many I am never compensated...why?!
So @LIMEJamaica had #ANOTHER internet disruption today from around 2-7 and I am not given #extra megabytes or even an extension on my plan!
Trust your #instincts its never wrong!
Amen to that! Time cold stay indoor...time hot go our the back....lol!

Sometimes the persons you ask for help, will say yes....but when push comes to shove....they are nowhere to be found! Kmt! Door close again!
If my life doesn't have #experiences,  and these maybe good they maybe bad...what will I have to share with my children?
Just like how gold is tried in fire, so too will the faith of relationships go through adversities
I'm made famous by and inefficient and incompetent justice system
Is that money to ease your guilt, negligence and inefficient justice system, how do I get back into society....?
And for my 'reward' for a crime i didn't commit I'm getting $40000 US per year...what am i to do now that you've taken 27yrs away from me?!
So you sentenced me 4 27yrs for a crime I didn't commit...now you actually see the truth! What has changed, what did you look for this time?
Disappointment like change is #inevitable but misery just like lying is #optional
Forgive and the same measure will be handed down to you....you will be forgiven!
Good things comes to those who wait but greater things comes to those who work while they wait

I love many things about traditional norms; hold the door, pull out my chair, get roses, walking to my right... I love to reciprocate
Live isn't like a DVD player...there are no #rewind #pause or #fastforward buttons only one call #play! So get up and move it!
We want a recount...re-question, re-judging! What the heck....she was placed below Ukraine and that girl in the yellow dress?! Pssh!!!!
I am extremely disappointed Jamaica placed fourth....even the crowd is disappointed! I don't even remember Columbia's question and answer
I think the judges questions aren't properly written...plus their accents, anywho its going ahead!

48hours in a car with 3 other people I don't know! @Digicel_Jamaica this mission is crazy
So our Jamaican men have started the new year/month with a bang?! You killed her and then yourself....hmmmm what msg is this?!
@LIMEJamaica all I am requesting is a reminder as to when my service expires
@LIMEJamaica I have a Nokia Lumia 710, I doubt tye problem is with the phone....its more the company that is giving me hell.
My credit is being used up because I AM NOT GETTING AUTOMATED MESSAGES THAT TELLS WHEN MY PLAN EXPIRES. How difficult is that @LIMEJamaica
All I request is a simple reminder as to when my data service expires or is that simplicity above @LIMEJamaica intelligence?!
Three days ago I called about the same thing, nothing has changed what is @LIMEJamaica really about?!
@LIMEJamaica customer service reps are the #WORST! I called for something simple, and I cannot get an answer,  I provided you with the info
Breathe....inhale......exhale....its just a bad day not a bad life...the situation looks bad but trust its working out for your good
Same thing @LIMEJamaica  internet SLOW....and look at the hour, things should be so fast I should be trying to catch up. Psssh!!!!
So I realized I was only asked a rhetorical question @LIMEJamaica
@LIMEJamaica there is also a delay when I send messages via what's app...10minutes, that's way too long
@LIMEJamaica I hate when the calls are answered by overseas customer care, they are not always able to help and it leaves me frustrated
@LIMEJamaica at seven each evening my service stops working and I am never given back any extra time when this happens
@LIMEJamaica The last time $200 came off because of the same #incorrect informatiom
@LIMEJamaica the credit came off because an incompetent customer care rep refused to read the info and gave me incorrect information
@LIMEJamaica I had credit on my cell to make calls and just about 6pm I checked the balance and it was only $2.49!
@LIMEJamaica yesterday I called and query when my plan expires and I was told 11pm, and I repeated myself are you sure that's the time! Yes
@LIMEJamaica I called and asked if could be sent even a day in advance and nothing
@LIMEJamaica everytime the plan is soon to expire I usually receive a text to say I have reach 'x' percentage of my data plan...that stop!
@LIMEJamaica I opt to use the 3day plan where I top up with $100 and activate the plan. After the monthly service embarrassed me.
Lest I forget @LIMEJamaica service is the #SLOWEST
If I had one wish, I wish @LIMEJamaica away....
Its appalling they trying to compete with another network and not even automated message I cannot get @LIMEJamaica duh betta
@LIMEJamaica its time for a change! I am constantly passed off to people who are #not Jamaicans hence my credit is nonrefundable....sighzzzz
I try to be rational and I know my calls are logged each time I call but gosh @LIMEJamaica needs to do better
@LIMEJamaica  make my day miserable and I've lost $300 worth of credit because of incompetent customer care reps
I am tired of @LIMEJamaica data service, I was inclined to switch to them but now I regret it!
Against my better judgment I'm left with no other choice.
If we knew what #faith represents, we would exercise it more when we pray! Pray, believe by faith. Faith is an #activator to all our prayers

Good morning tweetland...yea I know it's Saturday almost tempted to sleep in late but I just cant.....:( 
You can forget to be many things but never forget to be #grateful....its a simple act of giving thanks.
If ever you feel the need to be #validated by others its time to move on. You're valuable in the eyes of the creator and He values you.
Don't judge my BREAKTHROUGH  until you know what I've BEEN THROUGH

When a man loves you he #profess #protect and  #provide....Steve Harvey
You're pretentious, the worst kind, you actually believe that your pretentiousness is a reality! I pity your miserable life
You attempted to run me, not just of my pure joy but also of wealth I never possessed. You are a #thief and #sheep in wolf clothing
I made a wring turn I have made the most unforgettable mistake and now with unknown strength I pick up every piece and am trying my best
No more do I worry or wonder I have made peace with my past errors it has taught me the greatest lesson. #TRUSTNOONE!
You tried to ruin me, you use and manipulated for as long as God had allowed...but now so rejoice I have been made free from I'll forgotten
I've made my bed, I have spread it several mornings...i lie in it and its uneasy...that's why with enthusiasm I ran from the unkempt ones
How did I get so far drawn into a web of deceit &amp; lies...lost myself in that cobweb. I am most thankful that I was saved from those clutches
Don't regret anything you've given your all to, particularly if it failed, in life you can never judge how people will react to your honesty
The butterfly tells the  most beautiful story of how you can move from crawling to flying, its life journey teaches about humble beginnings
When they talk negative about you, when they gossip about you, when they despitefully use you, when they lie&amp;steal from you #haveaducksback
Our #incredible God can forgive #incredible sins
Up and extremely thankful. This is the day the Lord has made lets rejoice in it and be thankful!

The past is a waste paper, the present a newspaper, future  a test paper, so read and write carefully otherwise life is tissue paper..#paper
@stuartsmellie indeed...just like your purpose, no one needs to validate that unless you are unable to tell what your about.
@stuartsmellie my apologies for thinking #sexist...:) But I fully understand that feeling beautiful is about #you and not necessarily others
@stuartsmellie somebody loving you is bonus I will admit. It makes you feel even more beautiful cause you know you're #needed/wanted
@stuartsmellie I happy because I know my strengths and weakness...i can stand for myself without a man...that makes me beautiful in my eyes!
Beauty is more than those add-ons @stuartsmellie its more about confidence in Who you are and What you can do for yourself.
Head held high, shoulders square walking with purpose....not because things are good....but because there is purpose on the inside

All these guys are deserving of being where they are...their collection demonstrate that @Mission_Catwalk
I adore Andy's white dress...but that dress that can unzip at the bottom of Carla's black dress is  fly and Kurt you wow me @Mission_Catwalk
Watching Andy and Kurt is like watching..."desperate designers" high fashion high drama...@Mission_Catwalk

Have A Super Sunday tweeps! 
Thank you Lord for opening my ears and eyes to ear and see all the goodness you have left here for us
"@FactsGuide: Usually, the people with the best advice are the one's with the most problems." this here is reality!
If you want to find happiness spend your money on #experiences not #possessions or #materialobjects
If you truly wanna enjoy the sunshine, you definitely have to put up with the rain....
You cannot find peace by ignoring life...you find peace by accepting life; whether it's good/bad, raining or the sun is shining #acceptance
If you want something you've never had, you've gotta di something you've never done...
Stop making excuses, stop telling me why this or that happened.
Be strong enough to let go, be wise enough to know when to do so
The waiting is the hardest part...
I am sure this chik v has taken over my body again...my left side is half-numb ankle am feeling pain...its like I got a shot of tranquilizer
For Halloween customs, couldn't a designer make a face mask...that so common with Halloween @Mission_Catwalk
@Mission_Catwalk is tonight vintage or Halloween?
I often wonder where the waist is located, because if am correct it is at the navel, not at the hips and definetly not under the breast #KFC
Not even the place you visit to eat is sacred...these people and their profanity with toddlers around them..sighs
So someone got shot in the town and to hell everyone running in that direction....#onlyinJamaica
Had a long day at work...feeling a sense of #peace...but I must caution you, the bills are still due

When life gives you a million things to be mad/depress about, think of ONE thing to be happy about focus on it and laugh #knowyourhappyplace
Quit looking for reasons to be sad, look for things to be happy about and focus on those things it will eliminate your unhappy mood
