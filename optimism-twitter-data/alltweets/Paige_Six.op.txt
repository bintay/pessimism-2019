Gone Girl: Best Accidental Comedy 2014
@m2qm1g get on my lvl. 
@Bucket5000 the same guy who did all of the American Psychos. He's incredible.
I found an artist who puts the comics code seal on all of his crossover t-shirts. I must give him all of my money.
hmmm... @UnknownNeo, whatever it is, we're certainly not allowed to laugh about it.
@sirithre @Waterdragon1995 I let the art speak for itself.
Original character. Do not steal. 
Gamer. ga +y -mer. gay. Gamer. -ga mer. mer +maid. gay.
You're welcome. 
@LostestGamer welcome!
Certified. 
@Gibbomadness @GlennP311 it's awesome!
dc comics news sounds like its gonna be cool. luv dc ... — I'm hoping to get my questions video up next week. If... 
Just read the article. Which part are not surprised by? — I'm sorry, I'm not sure which article you're referring... 
@GlennP311 yes.
I love this trend of dying armpit hair bright colors. I fucking love it.
@RetroStadium she was a sweet lady.
@RetroStadium "humble". Life is too short to be humble.
I guess Zimmerman just learned that other people carry guns sometimes, too.

@ThisIsFusion @ProBearCub traffic violations and stops? Come on, now.
In this @Marvel issue issue she becomes a blonde Jack-O-Lantern ghost.
My newest @Marvel Spider-Woman variant #sneakpeak! This is my best work, yet! 
Sometimes when I wear scarves people yell at me because they think I'm Muslim. Idiots. I'm shielding my hair from the wind while looking fly
@Phail_Munsta like giving me more power and energy to feed off of. It's basically a prayer.
@DerekActual go lift a boulder, you big lug, you!
@DerekActual I know. But today you became a man. :claps:
@Phail_Munsta they get too invested in thief imaginary backstory. IMHO.
Breaking News: I'm a living person. Not a category for your fap folder.
Every single time I post a picture of my boyfriend, I lose followers on Instagram. You guys picked the wrong "gamer girl" to fap to.
@TheGravyDome this article has nothing to do with genres. Follow the actual scientist. Check out his TED talk at least.
No, I'm honestly not surprised. 
&lt;3 
Mother's Day Agenda: Shower finally. Send for prints while I shower. Search for good frames. Decorate my place. Not go to work.
I can't wait to get these framed. I'm on the hunt for the perfect one. 
No one is online to play Tetris with me. Obviously, because they're all being taken out by their mothers. 'Cause they live in her basement.
Happy Mother's Day &lt;3 
@adam_orth @AeternusArs I cannot wait. Stop teasing me!
Fabulous 
@m2qm1g 
We can't recast Alfred Molina for new Spider-Man movies because dumb idiots will be confused.
@m2qm1g I know. :(
@m2qm1g without 4chan you'd probably have a gf.
@m2qm1g 4chan.

Wow!
@Shoch123 or browse
@m2qm1g die.
@m2qm1g gross.
@Shoch123 it's not that. They made a perfect system tedious.
@m2qm1g no weeaboo trash zone. I approve.
@AeternusArs @adam_orth I want this painted on my wall.
@m2qm1g sounds legit.
@Shoch123 yeah I used to use it exclusively. Now I refuse
@Shoch123 that's cool. I stopped using them when they fucked up my apple app.
@Shoch123 I hear you. That's why I only buy trade at this rate.
@Shoch123 Image is almost always worth it.
@Shoch123 read.
Butt stuff.
Let me guess, you love Batman...
@WickedTheory that's not confirmed?
@Waterdragon1995 the next day, then!
Take your mother somewhere nice tomorrow.

@MeinDrache probably my many porn site memberships.
LOL @CatDeSpira! They only want you to open a connection w/them to get into your computer. Never share or accept ANYTHING from one of these!
ONCE, @MeinDrache? I envy you. One of the aim bots still won't talk to me until I apologize.

I don't think this would be a hard project to take on myself. I'll be making one of my own some day. 
I remember when the internet was still miles of green grass, and undisturbed woods.
@UnboundSenpai +1 
@TrickyAtl you can always hope they'll forget to feed their kids.
That girl was part of a couple who tried not paying their full bill before bolting, as well. Super classy. Glad their parents didn't abort.
Just looked a slag right in the eyes before discovering she didn't flush the toilet. No wonder she looked scared and then bolted. Animal.
@HUM108 You can't afford to live on any of the salaries, even with degrees.
@HUM108 Yeah, I haven't been offered full-time for a non-temp position since I was a teenager. And I didn't want it back then.
Best Article Title: 2014 
Now the second job is telling me they WON'T give me full-time. So I'm going have to keep the other one as well.
My best FCBD pick-up was Hero Cats.

@loafandjug @Galaxy_Junkyard Everything I wa following was cancelled or not an ongoing.
@StephenWilds do I ever not have thoughts? ;)
@m2qm1g I can confirm this #RT
@Bl4cktric RIP Nana. She died not too long ago. For real this time.
@nxultima what do you follow?

@nxultima awesome. What of?
@nxultima @DCComicsNews is it's own website about DC. I'm pretty sure @DCComics hates me.
Brian K. Vaughan
@arcade_android he looks nothing like Aquaman, spent the entire season of GoT as eye candy. Saying literally one word. Then he played dead..
@arcade_android everyone complains that I spew too much hate. But I hold a lot in...
@arcade_android I try not to think about it...

@ArcadeQtrMaster Stan Lee. Don't get me started on what he has "created".
@Waterdragon1995 I wish I only had to deal with this on the internet.
Me: I don't like the casting of So&amp;So for Such&amp;Such because This&amp;That.
Anon: But So&amp;So is gorgeous! 
I have a real problem with this logic.
@Sonicfan71 have you read Hawkeye? It's a very good comic.
@ArcadeQtrMaster I wonder if they don't pay the creator for this BW, like DC.
@Sonicfan71 they just removed the imprint, I'm sure.
@ArcadeQtrMaster you know what, I caught that too and thought it was so strange. What is that?
@Sonicfan71 But Image has my favorite writers right now. I'll probably follow @GailSimone to hell and back, whatever she does. &lt;3
@Sonicfan71 DC didn't reboot, thank fucking God. Marvel I'm still into Hawkeye and I was reading All New X-Factor.
@Sonicfan71 lately I've been really into Image. DC wasted a lot of my money last year and so did Marvel. Most of what I bought was cancelled
@Sonicfan71 I don't think this is a DC vs. Marvel thing. I just don't like her as BW.
@Sonicfan71 lmao, no that's not a stretch at all. Pretending Scarlett Jo shows range as an actress is a stretch. Great person, few faces.
@ArcadeQtrMaster eh, I don't think she really acts. ever. Charlize Theron all the way.
@Sonicfan71 I would cast Charlize Theron in place of Scarlett Johansson in every adult role Scar Jo has ever been cast as, as a start.
@UnknownNeo Yeah, it was, for the most part, what I expected.
@Prof_Random or they could have cast Iman as Storm and the world would have been saved.
@Sonicfan71 yeah but let's be honest. Me and you have nothing in common when it comes to comic movies and tv.
@UnknownNeo I watched it a few days before after it was leaked.
@Sonicfan71 I've been saying that the whole time.
Scarlet Witch and Quick Silver get weird 'French-Mountain' accents, but Black Widow isn't Russian at all. LOL
Honestly, I wasn't thrilled with the Black Widow love story either, but the whole casting of her is wrong so why stop now?
@katwoman153 probably better off that way. I envy you.
do you have a youtube channel? — I don't have one that I use for videos. I probably will start one though to tal... 
@partylethbridge @zfunk007 please tell me that you're trolling me.
What do You think about DC Television? —  
@partylethbridge @zfunk007 what was wrong with Deadshot? That's like the only thing I'm not complaining about.
Have You seen The Wolf of Wall Street? — Yeah, but I had completely forgotten she was in the cast or a character... 
@zfunk007 @partylethbridge #Harley 
@partylethbridge yeah, but it's the ravenous nature of Harley fans that allow them to successfully keep shilling shit..
@partylethbridge they want to move far away from the original harley look. I don't think we needed more Harley material but that's just me.
@partylethbridge yeah, I don't like that either. But I mean, my expectations were already pretty low.
@partylethbridge that's a terrible reaction image, unless your reaction is no reaction...???
I feel like obsessive .tweeting is the equivalent to attention whoring.
First Reaction to Suicide Squad Pictures 
I think I've #NailedIt 
@panicsw1tched Aquaman looks nothing like Aquaman and that is my most legitimate gripe about the casting. It pissed me off.
@panicsw1tched Yeah, but DC has Batman, I loved MoS, and I'm looking forward to this Miller-styled telling. I'm optimistic.
@panicsw1tched the movies are getting pushed out too quickly. I'm not comfortable with it. I can't see quality being maintained at this rate
.@panicsw1tched Eh, do you really expect something good from WB's generic side movies now-a-days? The animated movies are shit, too. D:
Do you think that actors work harder than voice actors? — I think that they're very different crafts and not ent... 
@panicsw1tched or are you talking about the solo comic that isn't in the same universe?

@panicsw1tched lol I doubt its going to be very relevant. Maybe theyve tweaked it to allow for a fanservice lovestory where Joker is lovable

Julie Newmar still looks fantastic. #statuesque
@GuitarAnthony you could never make a character look TOO much like a comic character for live movies, imo.
"She looks a lot like Harley". As if you couldn't throw a dart at literally any actress in Hollywood &amp; do that with the help of some bleach.
.@ligurmatic @Grummz right. Ok then.
@UnknownNeo thank you!
@basscomm I wonder if we can fight to have them removed because everyone does it and it revokes our freedom of choice as consumers.
.@Grummz I don't know who Slade is.
Unlocked the curls. We'll see how long they last! 
@Grummz could this have anything to do with Twitter in general tanking?
...even though my hair is in curlers.
It's a nice day, I'm going to take my daughter to the beach and read comics until it's getting too cold out.
Every phone plan I've considered has a MANDATORY Arbitration Provision and Class Action Waiver Provision. I'll never agree to that.
@CaCaityFoxx it won't allow me to RT,  but I think that everyone needs to hear this.
I haven't followed X-men very closely. 
@Alookeva lol it's okay! You don't have to do me any favors.
@Alookeva my expectations for them are so low, that I'm not even going to see the movie in theaters.
I need tips for brushing out curls for women with straight hair. HALP! I'm leaving mine in curlers for 2 nights and I don't want them ruined
@UnknownNeo Yes. I might be able to get one of the games today, though, because I didn't spend much on Saturday.
I usually buy nothing on May the 4fh because I've already spent all of my money at the comic shops.
@Gentleman_Joey are you familiar with Miller's Batman stories?
Not feeling the Suicide Squad pictures. But if I'm being honest, I've been dreading this movie the whole time.
@Wastedtheshow I kind of want them as framed prints.
@nxultima Thank you! I've been practicing to get it perfect!
I'm loving these. 
@nxultima Yeah, but they probably would have enjoyed FCBD, too.
@nxultima I'd have to agree.
On the plus side my hair was so much easier to do this morning.
@zfunk007 A cashier job by my house. Anything is better than this.
This year's free comic day haul: self-control exhibited. 
Alright, I'm off to get some comix. It took me about 3 hours for hair today, but at least none of it had tears and had results. &lt;3
Just posted a photo 
@Bl4cktric Magneto was worth it.
@H2OAcidic it'll happen!
A portion of last year's "Free" Comic Book Day purchases. I must exhibit more self control this time around. :3 
I'm kind of digging this half natural red/orange and black. I might keep it this way when I re-dye my hair.
It's 8 in the morning, FCBD, and I'm awake despite going to sleep at 3:30 AM because I'm committed to nailing down this hair styling thing.
@xucaen Guys today jerk off to facebook pictures and Halloween costumes. Lol
I work at a chain restaurant. One of the guys thought my LORT show was a 'cam show'. As if I'd work at a chain restaurant if I made porn $..
Phase 2 was a front roll. 
Not only is it Free Comic Book Day, but it's also Batman Day. 
@StephenWilds I don't like them. But I have been there. I used to work right over there. I've always been  @JHUComicBooks girl.
@StephenWilds @arcade_android pfft ew!
@StephenWilds @arcade_android omg, where he at!
We're live, but my topic was changed last minute to fit a new format. Still, give us a chance 
My suggested title for #LORTlive's episode tonight. Watch us live, soon: 
@Bl4cktric Welcome Back 
@Bl4cktric lmao, you were following me and I was confused.
@podge512 @Scrumpmonkey an acceptable theory.
@Bl4cktric I was wondering where you were in my feed and apparently you were unfollowed. Wtf fam. Did you block me then add me back?

Don't forget to watch Ladies of the Roundtable one hour from now. :) #LORTlive 
Our goth phase is behind us and we've successfully transitioned into Rockabilly (as predicted). - @OctoSlip
@GameLifter Thank you! I'm excited to start getting better at it and using this style regularly. :)
Tonight on #LORTlive I'll be talking about DCs policies for paying their creators. 9:30PM EST 
First ever solo attempt at Victory Rolls. Took me about 2 hours. Most of which were spent crying. 
Comforted by the fact that I'm not the only person who has cried while learning how to roll Victory Rolls.
My earrings even came with a complimentary dice bag. 
Let me just say, that when I do do "style", my presence is fierce. 
From my vaults. The Election Year is coming. 
Why does Instagram put my pictures into my feed? Is there a way to unfollow yourself?
Breaking in my shoes for my friend's upcoming wedding. I used do things like this a lot more often. I'm remembering why I gave up.
Just posted a photo 
Forgive my morning eyebrows, my new earrings arrived while I was getting dressed. 
@antonymity @captainjuggy "never gonna let another chick bring me down"
@demyztikx I'm so sorry to hear that. I have a good friend who suffers with lupus. Sending you my condolences &amp; an ear if you need a friend.
If I move to Boston, who will be my friend there?
Free Comic Book day is tomorrow and I have an evening shift at my job that's down the block from the comic store. 
@arcade_android maybe we're supposed to think dicks are utilities and not attractive anatomy.
@arcade_android There's a good webcomic panel about that I'll need to dig up.
@_tlr_ Bateman Begins should have been better.
@_tlr_ 
I'm embarrassed when I'm forced into using Tumblr style quick-gifs because good ones have too many frames for Twitter.
@Grac3G nay! Slim Supey!
@Grac3G It's Slim Super

Looking fly as fuck. We can all thank professor_foster. 
@HumanityPlague right now I just have them for the 3DS and DS, and I play Tetris battle online.
@HumanityPlague I always feel like an idiot buying Tetris for every system. But it's always worth it.
I'm finding that the answer to boredom is always Tetris.

@zfunk007 just got home from work and about to pass out. How are you feeling?
@Jay0253 don't do it.
@arcade_android --&gt; @BadgeofShame
@arcade_android you mean Joe Hanson?
@arcade_android that's a good Batgirl to have for a Bae. I'm going to steal her.

P.S. Mighty No. 9 is pushed back to September, and Hideo Kojima killed Konami by being a God.
Planning an Q&amp;A video for @DCComicsNews. Get to know me! Let's talk DC Comics!
@xucaen do people understand that this isn't to get you on a cam, it's to open a connection and harvest data?
"Hey! I found your name on a directory. I'm 24/f wanna share pics?!" - Am I the only one who thinks this sounds like a person on coke?
Seriously! 
He's also incredibly kind. Kind enough to let a stranger have a photo-shoot with his leg! 
Honestly, he's real. 
This man exists. :3 
I found the ideal Frame for comics to be bought in stores and its discontinued.
@arcade_android I've been writing a Paralax GL Fanfiction in my mind for years.
She went real hard until she threw her back out. 
@WickedTheory now we fightin'!
@WickedTheory seriously? I am too! Small freaking world. If you tell me JHU isn't the spot we can't talk. 
@WickedTheory at least it wasn't Breakfast Time. Even though it indeed IS breakfast time if you're in my timezone.
&lt;3 @ValiantComics, you've turned this day around. 
@WickedTheory "Gucci" 
@WickedTheory I wish that the sign was in Grasmere. One stop too late... or soon. It's right off the train!
@xaer0503 way
There is a Chinese place on Staten Island named Kum Fung, or it was, before a few delinquents removed the "g".
Getting caught up with some amazing interviews, then starting up with @DCComicsNews bringing you rich content &amp; love. 
@xaer0503 D:
@xaer0503 It's ok, I'll only cry for a short time.
Valiant unfollowed me. It's a sad day. I'm going to cry in a corner now. 
Aw @ValiantComics what did I do to deserve this? T_T I still love you guys.
When me and my daughter go out on a Spring Sunday. 
I picked up that awesome Futures End Sinestro #1 today to complete the wall in our room. Now I have to find a frame for it.
Thanks everyone who joined us for #LORTlive. See you next week?
Discussing the future of technology, and the kids. #LORTlive 
@UnknownNeo definitely!
Obligatory #LORTlive selfie. 
Tonight on #LORTlive @Ladiesrdtable going live with @classcraftgame who is revolutionizing gaming and education. 
@CHOBITCOIN I am, too. The pain is real.

I'll kick off my ReTweeting with this: The Future. 
@PAKallman It's annoying because I lost proof that some of my favorite people think I'm funny sometimes. :/ Meh. Otherwise, it's not a BD
@LostestGamer I don't know. I'm not mad about it. It's just Twitter.
So all of my tweets have been deleted. It's okay, though. I'm funny enough to bring it all back.
Don't forget, #LORTlive tomorrow 9:30 EST. Subscribe on Twitch and never miss a show!
