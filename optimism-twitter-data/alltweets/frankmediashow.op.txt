Exorcist III: 97:05 - Now an exorcism finally starts. Also, that scene in the house was amazing.
Exorcist III: "The nurse scene" was an interesting scene, especially with the implied decapitation.
The image of the bird he takes care of instantly makes him likable to the audience.
Exorcist III: 49:25 - the priest takes care of a bird and has a neat, small room.
Exorcist III: 41:30 - the explanation for everything is fascinating.
Exorcist III: 29:30 - the death in the hospital was foreshadowed well, and makes the audience feel anger at his death.
Exorcist III: 22:15 - the banter in the hospital is interesting, and helps the characters seem likable. Also the statue was a nice touch.
Exorcist III: they are discussing the problem of evil. Interesting discussion with the two sides represented well.
Exorcist III: 11:30 - Detectives are seeking the Gemini killer (obvious Zodiac ref). Detective also entered the theatre without paying.
Exorcist III: 10:15 - traditionally shot so far. Nothing stands out.
Exorcist III: the dream sequence uses shots from a human POV. Interesting.
Currently watching the Exorcist III. I will update as I make observations.
I think a #BlackPanther movie would be awesome. @Marvel
Next week #snl @nbcsnl has Louis CK and Rihanna. What an amazing show that'll be! #SNL40
#snl @nbcsnl this water slide sketch is not that funny. I didn't laugh once.
#snl @nbcsnl That last sketch was fine....?
LESLIE: Who this play for?!
BOBBY: In the program says it was dedicated to John Lennon and @shondarhimes.…
#snl @nbcsnl this student play sketch hits too close to home. It is hilarious.
#snl @nbcsnl this Willie character works really well. I keep laughing.
#snl @nbcsnl That 21 acts of kindness joke. Took me a second to catch it.
#snl @nbcsnl Reese Witherspoon fits this WAY TOO WELL. lol
#snl @nbcsnl "this is why vaccination is so important."
Well, she's not wrong. Just not much of a comedian.
#snl @nbcsnl yeah, the new Hamburgler is kind of creepy.
#snl @nbcsnl That look Leslie gave Colin... so cold.
#snl @nbcsnl  Leslie's here to save the show.
#snl @nbcsnl Aww Hawkeye was awesome.
#snl @nbcsnl Time for #WeekendUpdate. 
Show us your best, SNL!
#snl @nbcsnl Musical guest: Florence and the Machine. 
Indie/folksy sound. Not bad. I may look them up after.
#snl @nbcsnl this sketch is so ridiculous. Cringe humor at its best.
#snl @nbcsnl there was literally no reason for Kenan to be Carl Winslow in that sketch,  but it made it all the more hilarious.
#snl @nbcsnl OMG THIS SKETCH LOL
#snl @nbcsnl The celebrity game show sketches are hard to screw up. I'm hopeful and optimistic!
#snl @nbcsnl okay let's hope this episode gets more funny soon. 
Leslie,  save us!
#snl @nbcsnl and now we have fart jokes. 
Guys, that fart was a highlight in this sketch.
#snl @nbcsnl "a young Scott Bakula" lol.
#snl @nbcsnl okay,  back from commercial with... this pretty annoying sketch. Kenan and Jay are already shining through,  though.
#snl @nbcsnl So weird to see young Kenan again. It's like my childhood was peeking in. #90sKids
#snl @nbcsnl top mother's day apologies (imo): Kyle, Beck, and Sasheer.
#snl @nbcsnl this opening... thing... is okay, but it feels a little slow. Some of their apologies have been good though.
#snl @nbcsnl sell it, Reese! Let's see what you got...
#snl @nbcsnl okay, shirtless Marco Rubio was amazing. Otherwise, the sketch fell flat.
#SNL @nbcsnl Starting with a Republican skit. Easy to write,  hard to pull off.  Let's see how it goes.
Prepare for live tweeting during #SNL @nbcsnl 
STAND BY FOR THE AWESOME
Make sure to join me for live tweeting tonight during #SNL! 
Starting in about 1 hour and twenty minutes @nbcsnl
Currently watching #TheWalkingDead on syndication. 
The episode "Pretty Much Dead Already" is such a powerful and emotional episode.
J.S. Cardone's "Wicked Little Things" was an interesting #horrormovie, if not boring at times, and ultimately satisfying.
#horrormovies
Watching "Wicked Little Things" by director J.S. Cardone. So far it's an interesting setup.
#SNL @nbcsnl see you all next time, and make sure to follow if you enjoyed my live tweeting. Goodnight, everyone!
#SNL @nbcsnl well that was a decent show. Pretty hit and miss, but the Ultron, Blazer, and flight attendant sketches shined bright.
#SNL @nbcsnl this is an... odd sketch. It's not that funny, just kind of weird.
#SNL @nbcsnl corporate advertisers and hippie jingle writers. This could work well. Show me what you got, snl!
#SNL @nbcsnl Wiz's second performance. I like his music.
#SNL @nbcsnl this Virgin flight attendants sketch was well-written. Clever concept, good jokes, funny sight gags. Well done, SNL.
#SNL @nbcsnl automated flight attendants sounds like a nightmare. Lol
@nbcsnl so, I guess that just happened.
#SNL @nbcsnl that Blazer sketch was hilarious. Please make more.
#SNL @nbcsnl in all seriousness this sketch is pretty... random.
#SNL @nbcsnl "that's random."
#SNL @nbcsnl looks like a museum sketch. This should be interesting.
#SNL @nbcsnl Shaq and Charles. Great combination for jokes.
#SNL @nbcsnl DEAR GOD Vanessa looks so much like that #GameOfThrones character, it's hilarious. I feel like that's why this bit exists.
#SNL @nbcsnl this Bruce Jenner bit is hilarious.
#SNL @nbcsnl I don't know. This #WeekendUpdate is okay so far, but RBG is the same kind of character they always write.
#SNL @nbcsnl next up is the #WeekendUpdate. They have plenty they could talk about, so I'm interested to see what direction they go
#SNL @nbcsnl Scarlett is a great host and Wiz is a great artist. Solid show tonight.
#SNL @nbcsnl yeah, I feel like they use "girlfriends talk show" because it writes itself once you have the host's character.
#SNL @nbcsnl look, the whole Ultron thing was hilarious. And now for a "girlfriends talk show". IMO it's overused and not that funny.
#SNL @nbcsnl and now a @Marvel sketch.
#SNL @nbcsnl so far it's hilariously cringeworthy.
#SNL @nbcsnl uh oh... a Baltimore sketch. Let's see how they handle this.
#SNL @nbcsnl okay that sketch could have ended on a higher note, but the character Taran plays has promise.
#SNL @nbcsnl this Atlanta talk show sketch is hilarious.
#SNL @nbcsnl Kenan looks very uncomfortable during this opening sketch.
#SNL night, people. Interested in live tweeting during it? Stay tuned.
Why do horror movies have such unsatisfying endings?
Watching "Oculus". Stressful,  disturbing movie. I like it.
So in regards to "Horns" [spoilers? ], it was a fascinating movie with an unsatisfying ending.
"Horns", starring Daniel Radcliffe, is an interesting movie. Very conceptual screenplay.
Currently watching "Horns" starring Daniel Radcliffe. It's already obvious it's competently made and well acted.
"Bay Coven" (1987) - 93 min. - movie ended with a bang. It was... confusing.
"Bay Coven" (1987) - 72 min. - this movie is baffling. A dream sequence with a serious lack of rational behavior by the protagonist.
"Bay Coven" (1987) - The new question to ask is "why did she do that?"
"Bay Coven" (1987) - I keep finding myself asking "what was the point of that scene?"
"Bay Coven" (1987) - 52 min. - I like the repeat of the elevator shot from the beginning of the movie. A nice thematic link, and symbolic.
"Bay Coven" (1987) - 47 min. - HAHAHA WHAT!?! R.I.P. Slater.
"Bay Coven" (1987) - 45 min. - kid just handed Linda a dead mouse. Almost as if he was a cat. HMMMM...
"Bay Coven" (1987) - 42 min. - what was the point of the shop scene? Also, witches are immortal now?
"Bay Coven" (1987) - 38 min. - weird sounds effect choice for revealing that the half dead old man had moved. This movie has slowed down.
"Bay Coven" (1987) - 34 min. - they've discovered a pentagram altar with lit torches. I'm sure it's nothing.
"Bay Coven" (1987) - 31 min. - they said the name of the movie. Of course.
Currently watching"Bay Coven" (1987). Fairly standard 80's horror. Will update as it progresses.
@DrinkingQuest Congratulations!
Just watched #Babadook. Honestly one of the best horror movies in recent memory.
Currently in the intermission for the Lion King stage show. What a great production!
Check it out, from @frankmediashow!
#Comics #MarvelsDaredevi…
I forgot how excellent the first @InsidiousMovie was. The second was a good sequel, and I expect great things from the third.
@ScottCawthom is it true that you sold the movie rights to WB? If so, how much creative control do you have?
My channel is either old enough or viewed enough to now allow me to appeal copyright claims. I have appealed the false copyright claim.
#SNL #weekendupdate YES. The greatest character.
#SNL #WeekendUpdate is hilarious. @wwwbigbaldhead on it was awesome.
Why are @carlyraejepsen's songs so catchy? My daughter leapt out of my arms to dance in the middle of the living room. #SNL
Oh wow, #SNL is taking on #Scientology.
#snl that grandparents hotline sketch wasn't very funny.
#SNL this sketch is a weird subversion of those hotline ads.
#SNL A CNN sketch. Lol. Let's see where this goes... I'm betting milking the plane crashes for views.
#SNL That opening sketch was pretty good. I'm glad Michael Keaton didn't do a generic song like other guests.
#SNL this song to Michael Keaton is amazing.
Planning great First impression videos, and a new film analysis. However, I'm still scripting my short film as well.
It feels like a battle to get a good script done.
I'm going to do a First Impression of Daredevil, when it comes out.

Currently, DC is building a cinematic universe to compete with Marvel's universe. But can it work? I will be making a video on this soon.
.@watchmojo I'm glad The Conjuring was on Top 10 Horror 2010. I did a film analysis of it: 
The #SNL Bambi sketch was perfect.
#snl is off to a good start. That Wrestle Mania sketch was hilarious.
That #CateBlanchett interview is all kinds of awesome.
Watching "The Thirty-Nine Steps".  Even then it should have been obvious that #Hitchcock was a masterful filmmaker.
I have resigned myself to allow some douchebag to claim the audio in a video that he does not own. There's nothing I can do.
Currently watching "Highlander" while I do some work. Fast cuts and Queen go together really well.
@TeamYouTube I got a claim on my movie analysis, 'cause an artist sampled the movie I'm reviewing. Rejected the dispute. What else can I do?
@THR a lot of that was word of mouth, I would say.
@tonyszhou Tony, this was phenomenal.
"Dragon Princess" is an awesome karate/revenge movie. Highly recommended.
Currently watching 1976's "Dragon Princess". Great example of a 70's Japanese revenge movie.
YouTube is not the best medium for reviewing and analyzing films.
Currently fighting a copyright claim on my video.
C…
Anyone who does movie reviews or film studies work on YouTube should be familiar with the Content ID system. It is the bane of my efforts.
Part 3 of my #film analysis of #TheConjuring coming soon. 
Part 2's about #Camera angles: 
#Cinema #Movies #Horror
@Variety Now they need to film the first take of every line reading and use it in the movie.
@Real_Autistico I just might! Thanks for the suggestion.
@Real_Autistico I was planning on a part 5 for The Conjuring analysis on the sound editing. James Wan seems especially proud of it.
Working on the film analysis. It's taking much longer than anticipated, but this section is full of information.
I read a comment from a man in the industry saying that action, drama, and sci-fi are the best bets for budding scriptwriters. I wonder.
Can a shot be both beautiful and meaningless? Does the viewer find meaning in its beauty? Interesting questions to ask.
@LIFE pretty sure that was an early pledge of allegiance. 
I've been doing some #screenwriting practice. I have to say, it certainly helps.
Audio has been edited. Hope to have Part 3 of my #film analysis done soon. Part 1 available here: 
I'm considering an analysis of Aliens, by James Cameron. The scene with Ripley and the Queen is especially masterful.
Editing part 3 of my The Conjuring film analysis. I'm doing these do both learn film making from film, and to get more practice in editing.
@MakingOfs @RBwalksintoabar that is so cool.
Lighting is an interesting element of #filmmaking that is often underappreciated.

If any #indiefilm folks have suggestions for shooting a #shortfilm in the dark, I would love to hear them. In the script the power goes out.

Working on scripting for a short film I'm working on. Stay tuned for more details!
@mechriot @DAVID_LYNCH and some amazing films!
Just listened to @DAVID_LYNCH in "Room to Dream: David Lynch and the independent #Filmmaker". Very interesting!

Hey @empiremagazine has a #film studies 101 page with interviews and information. If you're into #movies... 
That's not to say that digital isn't the future. I would just hate to see #film stock disappear.
I get Nolan's efforts. Somehow film just looks more cinematic. But the tide has changed, and I don't know if he can stop it.
#screenwriting 
When I heard about #Chappie, I thought "why's it called that?" I knew WHY it was called it. I just don't get why they went with that name.
.@frankmediashow or maybe First Blood. Sorely underrated in it's art.
Thinking about my next #film analysis. I may do Pulp Fiction.
A #movie that uses a flat angle for every shot is like a novel that reads concretely throughout its length; it misses the artistry. #cinema
#SNL that #WeekendUpdate exchange between Colin and Michael was perfect. More of these between host jokes, please!
That #SNL chicken sketch was hilarious.
Working on part 3 of The Conjuring film analysis. Stay tuned for that!
And now both film analyses have been hit with copyright claims. Of course.
For me, the most disappointing thing is seeing a movie directed beautifully without meaning.
Currently reuploading both parts of The Conjuring's film analysis. Give me 24-hours to deal with @YouTube's #ContentID disaster...
My new twitter account is being built, along with my new YouTube channel!
