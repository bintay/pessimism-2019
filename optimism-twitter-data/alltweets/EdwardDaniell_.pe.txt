Cameron rules out referendum lmao thanks no voters if you hadn't fucked it up for us the first time we wouldn't have to deal with this :)):)

Would be sick if my mum could get home so I can quit looking after my brother and go to boxing
such a sceptic but also a fuckin idiot
cos a just did like I'd met the cunt hundreds of times and known him as an old family mate
how easily a bloke could just show up at your house like "aye I'm here to do a check on the boiler" and just be let in
float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Ali was some guy, actual living legend
Usually in the form of "check out this sick new band" and followed by them saying "nah I've known about them way before you"
When you mention how cool something is and the person shows absolutely no interest then a month later they introduce it you like "woah this"
Ken what makes me want to stab folk in the face?
Call me irresponsible but I'm just too happy to let college fuck me up today

Many vulnerable members of society won't survive another 5 years of it

#ToriesOutNow 
Homelessness has gone up 50% since Cameron was elected and he's still here why the fuck isn't that some sort of crime
I'm not sitting around for 5 years for the Tories to suck us dry someone demand a 'best 2 outta 3' clause on this shit I DEMAND A DO OVER
@stxrwxrs us 1-0 her

KING KUNTA
Odd Future//Oldie
Are there actually people who think the snp are some racist cult? Think they've done one too many £5 ectos and confused that with UKIP like
@asdfghjackb see folk who show up to gigs to do that shit??? vermin
@soph_thfc what a wank tweet
Fuck every one of you like "omg the protesters are just being a nuisance" fuCKIN OPEN YOUR EYES THEY'RE TALKING SOME REAL SHIT #ToriesOutNow

@_VotePedro idk man I'm at a point where I think I'd rather sell drugs or some shit than work in retail
@_VotePedro then fair enough I'll shut up
@_VotePedro maybe I'm just being ignorant as fuck like maybe people actually enjoy selling shit and smiling for strangers I just don't know
@_VotePedro but do you enjoy that shit?
@_VotePedro actual everyone sit inside like 'nah raise wage fuck off I'm not doing it'
@_VotePedro it's bullshit though like what if one day we all just stopped and demanded more
like nah don't even convince me you enjoy life
gotta be fucking mental to smile for customers you hate to please a shitty manager for £5 an hour
And that's not putting retail workers down, I appreciate what you do, but none of you enjoy that shit let's be honest
I'm 18 I want a real fucking job man not some shitty 'I hate my life but the £5 an hours cool' retail job like I want to get shit done ygm
wonder where we'd be without protesting?
@toxicsugarstone actual set this human on fire
@_VotePedro claim you were working overtime supervising the sambuca
@_VotePedro whit a DIV
john fogerty
realistically if I eat properly, do boxing twice a week and twenty minutes of HIIT 3 times per week I should be dropping

So throughout Beyoncés career she's only written herself about enough songs to fill an EP
the plot thickens 
"With help from co-workers" 
I'm clearly not the only one who's ever wondered this 
Well, I say 'musicians like Beyoncé' lmao has she ever written and released a song herself??? #amnofeart
A don't mind musicians like Beyoncé but her fans are fuckin frightening
Beyoncé could be a Tory and all of her fans would still be lit "YASSS SLAY WE SUPPORT U "
do they sell alcohol on trains???

Idk why hundred of thousands of people hate kanye west he is only doing his kanye best
@unholy_lovers p l o t t w i s t
@unholy_lovers perhaps he did
@unholy_lovers major "what the fuck was this actually John" moment but yeah he raises a very valid point
@unholy_lovers we didn't need 'em around anyway
@unholy_lovers I hope its a form of natural selection where the people who give too much of a fuck about identity self combust
@unholy_lovers and if you even try and call them out you just feel like you're rapidly lowering your IQ
Actual cba voting but I'm obviously still gonny
@unholy_lovers yeah like there's so many 70's band posts and TV references I need to reblog but these fucking sjw are a nuisance
He's never looked more like a Wallace And Gromit character here 
@unholy_lovers um???? I don't identify as any of that WE CAN END THIS IGNORANCE TOGETHER PEOPLE

Honestly such a melt sometimes
I've bitched about 'that arsehole' who posts about exercising on social media but I am literally that guy, I am he. I'm so sorry. #hipocrisy
The lads a work of art
See if I looked like Ricki Hall I'd wake up happy as fuck every damn day
Guns N' Roses were sick until Kurt Cobain came around and made them look like crossdressing pirates
So I'm making a new playlist and then going out for a while peace
Pretty much just spent the last week depressed, unmotivated and feeling sorry for myself n I really need to push myself to go out for a run
IT IS DONE THE MARATHON IS OVER
DUN DUN DUNNN
So be it, Jedi
Today I've only eaten a stir fry and drank a mango smoothie and I'm not even thin yet, angry and quite offended
STARTING RETURN OF THE JEDI
IM AWAKE AND BACK ON THE STAR WARS GRIND EPISODE 5 HERE WE GO
OK IM CALLING IT QUITS IVE SPENT THE PAST 7 HOURS WATCHING STAR WARS FS
I've been watch Star Wars for six hours straight I'm weak
ON TO EPISODE 4
It is 2015 stop calling yourself a superwholockian for the love of god
Mind when Anakin was pure sound
'So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause' is a fuckin awesome line
"Execute order 66" EXECUTE ORDER DIS DICK
The clones have turned on the Jedi, the younglings killed too, and I'm sitting here like "what the actual fuck man" like I do every time
@EdwardDaniell_ if windu**
@ffruitshoot phaser pedals are cool
Would have been cool Windu had stuck it out until the end but I guess his death was quite a big deal in terms of anakins good vs evil debate
Grevious is dead, good
General Grevious gives me the fear
"Kill him, kill him now" WOOOO SHIT DOOKU JUST GOT HIS LIFE FLIPPED TURNED UPSIDE DEATH
STARTING EPISODE THREE. NO PEE BREAKS, NO FEART.
A don't trust any cunt who's eyebrows don't match their hair, no Alastair Darling, no Count Dooku, nae cunt
People I hope are immortal: David Bowie, Ellen Degeneres, RDJ, Betty White, Ezra Koenig, Peter Hook, Steve Buscemi and Samuel L Jackson
2 weeks until I go to Macclesfield!!
mcm me
Am a psycho magnet like
@n4rcissus same!! Its probably my favourite out of episodes 1-3
@n4rcissus completely agree though
@n4rcissus I'll youtube it I've already got episode two in
I just said 'moviethon' remind me how I'm not a virgin nor am I a forty year old dad
Except I'm no watching the first episode because a combination of shite politics and jar jar binks isn't how you should kick off a moviethon
may the fourth be with u (and so it begins) 
It's one hour until may the fourth and I'm gonna marathon Star Wars movies HYPE
@Artpoprr7 I'm funny
Mac Demarco is a weird cunt like but he's so gid
@piersmorgan its '...'
#MayPac 
Mayweathers legacy will live on, his fights will be watched for years to come and even those people will think "what a fuckin pussy" #MayPac
I compare it to a game of Call of Duty. Do you rate the cunt who goes 48-0 whilst camping? Of course you fucking dont. #MayPac
Ashamed to see him so close to beating Marciano's record because Marciano would have dropped this clown with one punch #MayPac
I'm so upset at this shit
"He didn't do nothing" write that on my fucking grave
@FloydMayweather hi I'd like a refund as compensation for wasting those 36 minutes watching you shy away from a real fighter dm for paypal x
I want @MikeTyson to square-go Floyd
Unbeaten, yes. Boring as fuck, too.
He's unbeaten because he feeds off running around the ring, running down the clock and counterpunching. Never seen an aggressive Floyd.
"Technical boxing" what it is, is boring as fuck. If you're being paid 100+ mill to be there, I'd be fucking biting the cunt no dancing away
Manny is disappointing as fuck, Floyd boxing like he always has
Clinching, pushing his head down, low blows and dancing around??? Yes, Floyd truly is a brilliant fighter I'm amazed 10/10 better than pac x
Imagine paying 100k a seat for this shit
I've waited five years for this?
Points need to be excluded by the ref for that shit its too frequent
I hate how much Floyd clinches
FUCKIN YASS MANNY
Stop holding him you pussy cunt you're being paid 100+ million for this, fuckin get stuck in
I'll be upset if Mayweather runs/clinches the entire fight, it's tactically sound but if he wins that way then I still hold Manny higher up
Mayweather is slippery as fuck
If a was that ref I'd have shit four times that day
I'VE WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS SHIT
There he is
IM SO FUCKIN AMPED IF MAYWEATHER WINS WE RIOT
Fucking where's Michael Buffer who's this cunt
I've had a forty minute conversation with my friend outside and this fights still no started fs
these fighters have been shite bar @vasyllomachenko
Does this commentator actually not know who Evander Holyfield is?
This Mexican dude feels nothing
@vasyllomachenko is a beast
@alisonffs look I'm sorry I was thinking if we had any Cinderella references and we don't so I was all????

@alisonffs tnx
@alisonffs omg tag me next time

JOURNEY ARE PLAYING IN BETWEEN ROUNDS FUCK THIS I PAID £20 FOR THIS TRASH
@CalMilligan1 super sikh tweet innit

@stxrwxrs yeah but can I have your cat
That guy was a fucking tank oh my god
Sick when ur meant to watch boxing with your best mate but he's too busy wanking himself intae a coma to show up @ mildo
AND SO IT BEGINS YASSS I miss watching boxing
@sadplanets aw thank you <TWO HEARTS> totally strange scenario and I didn't think this would go down too well but yeah have a rad day!
Here I'm ranty as fuck on snapchat btw
This fight actual feels like such a movie like Manny is the good guy and Floyd is the baddy
@sadplanets and I swear I'm not weird I had you on twitter before insta its all good (and I'm not helping my case) I am sorry
@sadplanets and I was all "uhhh there's a girl but I can't even remember her name" and yeah I lost my cool for a moment and she's drunk
@sadplanets ok I can explain we were discussing people on the internet that u wish were actual real people??? n complaining about others?
And it's like lmao bye bitch xoxo
Like for real you realise it when your friend messages you like "here that lassie that you speak to is giving me the chat"
The whole "guys telling me he don't speak to any other girls are liars" thing is really hilarious because girls are the same
Also I've seen so many awesome black outlines that have been ruined with colours so I'd be feart of that happening
at least with black tattoos I know its gonna go blue and that's cool with me
I'm too pussy to commit to a coloured tattoo like hell yeah that shit looks rad but in forty years idk if I'd still enjoy it when it fades
I've been waiting like five years for this fight I'm so amped
The look of a man who isny feart  
And see if its an 8th round ko to Manny I'm gonna fucking kill
I wish a wisny skint so I could put a line on for Manny vs Floyd
So writing is easier
And I'm actual getting no too shabby at guitar in terms of chord changing and wee shitey solo riffs
Spent the last hour pissing about on a song because Mel told me 'I'm all in a funk' and its honestly dire but am gonny make us both famous
@d0nglord420 I like to think we had a moment 
Three folk text me and one of them is my maw that's when ye ken

Honestly don't think I could be a waiter in a place like this, you can just tell these staff are pure snakes
She just swore in front of a customer fuck sake man I WAS ROUTING FOR YOU
Everyone's watching over her and making her panic and I'm sitting here like "it's ok I've worked in food places before ur doing good chill"

But put my faith in Pacquiao
I'm in frankie and bennies and this Italian lady served me and its her first day and aw man it's okay I understand u can quit panicking
@Svengali__ I haven't slept
@Svengali__ that seems like such a logical thing why didn't I think of that
a song idea so good that I'm trekking an hours bus to Edinburgh just for strings, see if I forget the melody I'm gonna kms
@_VotePedro Didn't mean to say 'unless' pure fucked it
@_VotePedro with the exception of unless the lead singer for vampire weekend, wearers of white leggings should be destroyed
Would go to Aviemore just to see Ben Howard, seeing him at T last year was life changing no even joking
@Amberambles And yeah we should, slide into my dms at some point with a date and I'll clear the day
@Amberambles tried and failed, kept playing stairway to heaven
@Amberambles you should be a writer amber, that shit gave me anxiety
@Amberambles I can do it. Can I use chords beyond the twelfth fret to make it lighter?
I want to write a song so bad but my electric guitar has no strings and it's a bit hard just using a bass
Rather than go to college I'm feeling a day trip into Edinburgh to buy more books and guitar strings
@JeremyLoops I only just realised that Down South is on Spotify!! #newmorningjam
I am, admittedly, a wee bit 'stabby with knives' today
Hahahah real talk I tried to sleep at like 2am and my alarm just went off I've just had my eyes closed the entire time no sleep HAAAAAAA

@CreekH0use no sure whether to buckle or whitey
@DovahkiinAmy I'm the same, just made the angriest sandwich of my life, not sure I can fathom exactly how I feel so I'm gonna cool off
@DovahkiinAmy or even better pretend that the racism isn't there
@DovahkiinAmy what's fucking me up is people trying to defend the racism n justify the killings with "well shoulda done what the cop asked"
@DovahkiinAmy and it's the wrong way to go about shit
@DovahkiinAmy but like you say, this doesn't even feel linked to Freddie's death
@DovahkiinAmy I don't know man, I get it but I don't, if some cop broke my kids neck and denied it I'd set shit on fire too
@DovahkiinAmy and that's infuriating
@DovahkiinAmy but how long ago was all of that? Shit hasn't progressed
@DovahkiinAmy Malcolm wanted riots and violence, and Martin opposed
@DovahkiinAmy what I find interesting is that it's replicated the Malcolm x vs Martin Luther King scenario to resolve an issue
@Hdans1975 Cop broke a kids neck/severed spine, kid died, cop denied it, riots break out
Wonder how much money people are gonna donate to that cop like they did for Darren Wilson during the Ferguson shooting #BaltimoreRiots
@jessi_babyx @___ashleymd 
#BlackLivesMatter
@empxthyx and I'm fully prepared to jump out this window because it's lowering my IQ
@empxthyx I'm literally arguing with the most irritating fucking white girl who doesn't think racism exists in the police force
"Omg ignore the racism guys it doesn't exist in my basic ass white girl world where everything is glittery and yay" fuck outta here
If you ignore an issue it won't simply disappear because the worlds not all sunshine and rainbows you fucking idiot, allow yourself cunt
All unarmed, majority followed instructions, children murdered, and you're going to say "well if they had followed instructions" disgusted
White girls trying to defend the police killing unarmed poc saying "they'd be alive if they followed instructions" get the fuck outta here
@jessi_babyx @___ashleymd every single person shot was unarmed, stealing doesn't justify being shot- stop defending an unjust racist govern
#BaltimoreRiots

I could probably write a song every day if I didn't constantly fault my own work
I love that half way through the song I'm Gone, Seasick Steve decides to tell a 5 minute story about a dog then continues the song
Used to want expensive clothes but it meant I'd be broke as fuck and honestly I preferred having cash for less trivial shit to worry about
@stxrwxrs showwww me

"Latin American Indie" is a genuine playlist on Spotify and it's tHE SHIT
Sort of into the habit of eating really healthy food and now when I try to eat something shit it tastes gross??? I AM BURDENED WITH A CURSE
A Scottish person saying the word 'dork' 

Like if you cringed too xoxo
I was raised on 80's pop and techno, some of you fuckers don't realise how good you had it growing up
and they can reply to you, and you get random ones from random people too idk it's just really cool
fling is the coolest app I've used in a while, like snapchat but it sends the photo/video to 50 random people all over the world
"Alcohol may not solve all your problems but neither will water or milk."
I want to be in some dumb indie movie as a room mate or some shit, I'd have that role down
And by "I can barely afford one" it means I have about £3 to my name with no income
I was quite content with not having a job until I realised that festival season is soon and I can barely afford one never mind two
They getting wide??? 
@CreekH0use Nah but I'm hardly one to talk I have a bukowski quote on mine, mind that lassie who got "hail Satan" up her arm?
@CreekH0use seen worse tbh, I just question the placement
whit a rookie eh
usually spit the dummy when I try n play electric guitar but I'm actually having fun since figuring out how to use a plectrum properly
Real talk if any more youtubers show off their 'new car' or 'new house' then I'll be forced to make a channel these people are stacked

'Tumblr feminism' or as I like to call it "missing the fuckin point all together"
Actual embarrassing to be a user on tumblr now it's beyond problematic and the level of misandry on that site is beyond fucking belief
BUT MOST OF ALL PALE BLOGS IT IS 2015 THAT SHITS JUST EMBARRASSING BY THIS POINT
implying that you have to be some sort of diverse couple in order to be relevant or interesting???? actual fuck off walnut leave them be
or how somebody passive aggressively captioned a photo of a couple kissing as 'yes how refreshing a straight white couple kissing'
And how a cosplay post of twins dressing up as peter pan and peters shadow was cast as "racist"?? like no you child it's a fucking shadow
Tumblr fucks me off with how many users overanalyze things into trying to make them offensive when they ain't like chill out you uppity cunt
just why 
@unholy_lovers ladies take notes 
@unholy_lovers in before some cunt claims it's all because some girls are insecure about having thin lips x x x

parklife festival looks banging
For the most part it sort of just looks like a festival for the bands who were rejected from Download Fest with pierce the veil, bmth etc
I wanna go to reading/leeds for the fact that its a major festival but the lineup really couldn't be any worse from where I stand
Download looks dire
canny wait for snapchat stories to be based on livi like, just some cunt downing a bottle of dug outside erf whilst fingering his cousin
I've lost five pounds in the last week yaldi
@JeremyLoops cheers!
Huge dilemma that I have to choose between. TITP or Macclesfield to see every song my all time favourite band has ever released?
@JeremyLoops Hi! Just wondering, but what are the main loops pedals you use when you perform?
@ genres which feed off of teenage angst to make a profit
Actual hate metalcore so much hahah it's infuriating how talentless yet popular it is, binary and angsty teen lyrics is literally all u need
If you're in a band who writes like "you won't hold me back anymore, I'll show you what I'm made of -breakdown-" then fuckin abort yourself
sad indie music breaks my bones
Callum is asleep and I have no meds at his house hahaha the ultimate dilemma do I wake him??? A WANTY GO HAME

@Morning_Wood22 @zNayrz we did make that haha
@Morning_Wood22 @zNayrz you know since turning eighteen, I still drink Budweiser...
@Morning_Wood22 @zNayrz I still do judge myself for that shit

@Morning_Wood22 @zNayrz cough Ryan cough
@Morning_Wood22 @zNayrz yeah I second that, I'd say I wanna do all that again but getting steaming in a park sounds like rock bottom now
@Morning_Wood22 @zNayrz drinking underage was way more exciting than it is now
@Morning_Wood22 @zNayrz you mean the one where we drank like four or fi- yeah no I got ya

Sometimes ideas for songs are just handed to you on a plate
she taught him English, and 17 days later they got engaged, he was such a cool man

I figure if I reach grade 7 in music then I can tutor everything bass related up to it and make some cash that way
@shrekmemes I did, it's "bear grylls ain-shit" it's double barrelled x
@shrekmemes I believe so, the inferiority complex got too much n he had to change it to something more masculine to challenge it
@shrekmemes He is also called Edward n I'm the superior one
I can already tell this movies gonny reduce me to tears
I'm watching The Theory Of Everything why do I hate myself so much
when ya new tattoo is at that itchy stage and you're using every ounce of your willpower not to scratch it 
@shrekmemes deed

what the fuck man I'm so over this
mum... mum
wait no where are u going with that nutella
I'm fucking loving this, she's actually given in to me with the "eat fresh food" chat
my mums totally emptied all the frozen shit in my fridge and freezer, all the unhealthy shit and just binned it
TATTOO ARTISTS befriend me, abuse me with your art, never speak to me again
@ashley_louise69 my daily mantra
My take on tramp stamps, saschas take on fun 
Not likely but something to look towards???
Ok if I wanna go to India for Diwali I have to go in Novemner
learning Sanskrit
and idk visitting some temples would be cool
I just really wanna pet an elephant
India is goals
Twitter's basically just an excuse for talking tae yourself
But the patter of these Americans using it to fuel their "makes me wanty kill Arabs" patter is horrendous, but yh fair dos, case closed
And I mean I guess the movie spurred it on
OK so I read up on it and apparently racist Americans got pumped up about the movie and used it as an excuse to be a cunt to Arabs n Muslims
I only watched it because people reacted telling me it was soldiers running down streets shooting brown people n shouting "fuck Muslims" etc
I'm just confused is all
It doesn't exactly paint a good picture for people of that descent or image but there was nothing blatant??? seemed open to interpretation
but if someone wants to clear it up without implying that I'm islamophobic/ignorant/racist then that'd be cool, I could be ignorant though
I mean I could be completely wrong but I heard no mention of religion being mentioned in the film so idk I don't really get it
he fucking nailed this role 
Season eleven of greys anatomy because I decided I want to be eternally sad today

#wcw @asdfghjackb af
he's 13 ffs
makes me jealous how my little brother can talk about going abroad and I have to really talk myself into leaving my house most days
life is a trip and we all take it for granted
I just wanna be normal again and not have to worry about freaking out abroad or having a mental breakdown n it might not ever be like that
Which is really quite upsetting how obvious it must be that I'm not
And that they'll pay for a trip abroad when I feel mentally ready
I didn't get to go on a trip abroad and my 13 year old little brother is going to Paris next year, my parents have decided they feel for me
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM MEEEE
It's all magical
I keep thinking that I've found my favourite Pink Floyd album and then I listen to the next one
I'm gonny listen to the prodigys new album and take a bath wae a microwave

FOR MY HONOUR
So Bear Grylls real name is Edward 

I'd like to fight this man for name rights
My tattoo is at that scabby/itchy stage and it's driving me mad
I actual think I've just remembered how to do an arpeggio fuCK
okay but yeah I played both songs perfectly, I knew two major pentatonic scales, one minor position and I was real polite??? 

fucked it
if I've fucked this up I'll greet I PLAYED REALLY WELL
and I couldn't play a second position minor pentatonic scale, didn't know an arpeggio
I'm really not sure man, last years audition all I had to do was play two scales and two songs but this years was much harder
That was fucking brutal. Messed up the theory test, played my pieces to perfection and couldn't sight read??? played most of the scales fine
That written test was brutal, even more nervous now but my lecturer said he was "happy to see me back" so?????
See if life could do me a solid and give me my old bass tutor as my auditioning lecturer, I'd basically be guaranteed a place
@Katelynasaur good luck!
Gee the people whit they want

Troy and Abed are motherfucking goals
@al_pxcino yeah they were the first "metal" band I was in love with, lest we forget, though I have seen the light- pish.
@al_pxcino which one?
@al_pxcino nah they're nowhere near as irritating, different vibes from both, but I just tie them in with bands I switch off when folk talk
And your squinty fucking eyes!!!!!!!! take a proper selfie that you won't regret in a year when you stop wearing your wee brothers clothes
@al_pxcino it's kinda like asking Alexandria for me, the idea puts me to sleep
@al_pxcino it's all the rage
@al_pxcino much the same as pop musicians do, angsty lyrics and or/love songs
@al_pxcino For corporate businessmen to sponge money off teenage angsty hormones

Being on the staff page for this wee festival is actually so exciting, so many cool bands being announced and suggested to us
@_VotePedro FUNNY
@_VotePedro dae ye no have wheels

@_VotePedro go out, the train to manchester/Preston is soothing as fuck when you're hungover
Awesome when you wake up to your laptop fucked and your phone locked, today's going spectacularly already AND I JUST WOKE UP I AM SCUM
Enjoy.
And as you greet over how "you're not alone" or that conveniently relatable shitty ex? businessmen n labels are having a wank at the thought
Except pop isn't very cool these days, so yeah let's incorporate the basics into metal n make it edgy so teens will think it's cool GENIUS
And like I said before- it basically is pop.
You listen to it for that "sick breakdown" or those "heartfelt lyrics" but critically listen to it and you'll see you're being fed shit
And by "metal bands" I'm mostly concerning the likes of Pierce The Veil, Of Mice and Men, Sleeping With Sirens etc etc
It's a fuckin travesty, there's no integrity to it
And pop musicians do the same with hormonal teens looking for "the one"
And unfortunately bands that I once loved just put out shite to cater to the needs of angsty teenagers to make cash
The similarities between new metal albums and 2000's pop music is incredible, same lyrics just with a shit guitar wanking solo and triplets
WIDDEN PALLETS 
I've watched so many peoples lives and adventures when they vlog this week because I'm ill aND ITS DEPRESSING ME

@EmmyEmzzzz Club "area code" is gonna be minted like
@immipunk and who can tell how long we have to live? I'd hate to die young and think "all my life was just studying for bullshit exams"
@immipunk I just think there are more important things to sweat over like enjoying yourself idk
@whiskeykisses__ then what you gotta do is drop the negative people who think that- I don't undermine going to uni btw- just not my cuppa
I don't really have much intention of going to university and it's honestly not the end of the world
See tbh if you have no intention of going to university it hardly makes you a waster
I'd put my savings on The Libertines headlining reading and leeds, but it's still not enough for me to consider it over @OfficialTiTP
And going from the whole "no physical control over my body" to waking up??? you really question how you're moving around it's so trippy
Couldn't even control my breathing
It all felt so real and I was told to "stop walking towards them or I'd be shot" and all I could control was my hands, fingers and feet
just had another experience with sleep paralysis where I was shot in Vietnam on a weird rebel army mission thing haha I am shaking like fuck

@shrekmemes it's lame :( I mean they're probably bored of it, as mentioned in the last track on the album
They probably won't play Sorry You're Not A Winner :( didn't play it the last time I saw them either, boo
