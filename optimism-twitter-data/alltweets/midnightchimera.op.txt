So sad to hear about The Mindy Project.  I love that show!
@BestThingFrom85 You speak the truth.
@BestThingFrom85 Gambit used to be my favorite X-men alongside Rogue.  I thought Tatum was an odd choice, but I've heard he loves Gambit.
@BestThingFrom85 I honestly don't know.  I was pleasantly surprised by DOFP, so who knows?
@BestThingFrom85 I heard they were thinking about a tv show for her, but she can only really come about after Captain Marvel happens.
@BestThingFrom85 My new favorite is Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan).  I've been reading her comics and I love them to pieces!
@BestThingFrom85  I know!  I'd love to see Spider Gwen, though.  I've heard great things about her character.
@BestThingFrom85 Too bad the movie rights aren't owned by Marvel Studios, though.  Would love to see them alongside the Avengers.
@BestThingFrom85 I'm optimistic about it; loved the casting, and the trailer was fun.
@BestThingFrom85 I love Marvel sooo much!
Martin Freeman in the MCU?!!  AAAAAAHHHHH!  LIKE CHRISTMAS!
Thank you @josswhedon Looking forward to this movie helped my sister and I make it through some tough days.  And it was totally worth it.
@BestThingFrom85 OMG ENJOY!  I haven't seen it yet!
I think if there were one sound to represent who I am as a person, it would be an exasperated sigh.
OMG!!! #itsallconnected #AvengersAgeOfUltron
I'M SO HYPED 
I'm a pangolin! What's your Earth Day #GoogleDoodle quiz animal? 
And this is crazy
But are you going to
Eat that baby 
I can't believe we still have two weeks until #AvengersAgeOfUltron  comes out.  I NEED IT YESTERDAY.
How in the world do I feel kinda bad for Fisk?  What an amazing show. #Daredevil
Every flipping time my stupid Dell forces me to update, my Netflix gets totally messed up.  Ugh.
I just backed Nerdache Cakes Bakery- The Geeky themed bakery! on @Kickstarter 
Calling it a night after five episodes, but I'll be back tomorrow! #Daredevil
You guys... Two days til #Daredevil!  AND THEN 21 DAYS LATER, AVENGERS!
@BestThingFrom85 I honestly don't know how I'm going to get through work the next three days waiting for it!
@BestThingFrom85 I seriously can't wait!!!
@BestThingFrom85  YUP!
OMG So many revelations and surprises on this episode! #AgentsofSHIELD
Psst... You guys... #AvengersAgeOfUltron is coming out soon.  Just so ya know.
@nerdist @kristenschaaled Kristen Schaal, caught in the bathroom!  Loved it!
@io9 omg I read this as "Transformers to be connected to Marvel universe" and almost had a heart attack.
My single self and my sweat pants will be over here enjoying some Netflix and ice cream.
@BestThingFrom85 I should try that!
@BestThingFrom85 I only have time for one, but that would be amazing!  Just had one before Agents of Shield!
@BestThingFrom85 @DCComics Green tea is the BEST!
@pinklem73 I knoww!!  I can't believe we have to wait so long for the next season!
@pinklem73 Isn't it?  I got hooked after watching s1 on Netflix!
@BestThingFrom85 The second it comes out!
@BestThingFrom85 hahahah
@BestThingFrom85 I KNOW!  I was shaking!  LOL
AHHHHHHHHHHH!! OMG!  #AgentsofSHIELD SO much tension!
Just saw What We Do in the Shadows!  Loved it!
Leonard Nimoy, so sad to see you go.  RIP.
I thought you guys were going to get What We Do in the Shadows on 2/27?  I was really looking forward to it. @RaleighGrande

NOOOO!!!  TRIPPPP!!! #AgentsofSHIELD
Ready to watch #AgentsofSHIELD  mid season finale!

Praying for Mike Brown's family.  This is a travesty for them and our country. #FergusonDecision
#AgentsofSHIELD has been crazy suspenseful today!  An amazing episode!
Marvel: From Pulp to Pop is a nice break from waiting on election news!
It feels like we lost 3 hours by ending daylight savings. #hibernate
Just eating leftover Halloween candy and waiting for election news.  You know, like you do.
@BestThingFrom85 You know it!
@BestThingFrom85 Right?  Captain Marvel, Black Panther and Inhumans plus a two part Avengers movie?  Crazy!
@BestThingFrom85 Marvel is so awesome!
Tuned in to @AgentsofSHIELD !
MARVEL!  YES!
First @Avengers : AGE OF ULTRON Trailer Reportedly Attached To @Interstellar 
Call the Midwife season 3 is on Netflix! All right!
Short Term 12 is a great movie!

Much better reception for protestors today it seems: 
@BestThingFrom85 I think it's something that we as Americans should all be shocked and horrified about. We've gotta keep it in the news.
@BestThingFrom85 It's disgusting and vile what the police are doing.  #Ferguson
@BestThingFrom85 I am seriously in awe of what is happening. I can't believe it's not all over the 24 hour news! We have to spread the word.
Thank you to those of you who are reporting on social media from #Ferguson and shining a spotlight on what is happening there.
Social media is so important in the telling of what is happening in Ferguson right now #Ferguson

So sad to hear about Robin Williams passing.  RIP, O Captain, my captain.
Thought about going to see TMNT, saw io9 post and decided to see #GuardiansOfTheGalaxy again.  Because better.
Do we really need live coverage of the Ebola patients coming into the US? Do people really have nothing better to do?
@BestThingFrom85 It was perfect!  I already have so many of those songs on my iPod.
@BestThingFrom85 Oh my gosh, yessss!!  I've already seen it twice!
#GuardiansOfTheGalaxy was delightful.  Thanks @JamesGunn!
@anacoqui Awww, good luck in getting it taken care of!  I agree- being a librarian is the best! :)
@anacoqui  I have had certification panic for different reasons, but it's unpleasant no matter what.   I hope it's okay now!
RDJ just posted a picture on Facebook of 20 red, 2 white, and 1 purple roses and said we'll understand later... Panel clue? #MarvelSDCC
@pr…
Replaying FFVII for the millionth time.  Feels like coming home.
Just saw #Chef and loved it! Great film.
Win a Trip to The Avengers 2 Set and Hang out with @MarkRuffalo in aid of Water Defense 
Ugh now I'm playing as Cyclops and Jean Grey.  Not my favorites... #legomarvelsuperheroes
I saw a Lunchable at the grocery store, bought it, and ate it.  At no point in this sequence of events did I think this was a bad idea. WHY?
@anacoqui I've read a few of those and you're in for a treat!  I need to set my summer goals as well!
I am really bad at solitaire, but not for lack of practice.
Finally playing Lego Marvel Super Heroes!  Yay summer!
@BestThingFrom85 Maybe with headphones out of respect for their many neighbors?
Well, now that school has ended, my downstairs neighbors have decided to blast their stereo in an attempt to break the sound barrier.

All these changes to Netflix are making me really uncomfortable.  Where is my familiar old pal?
And NPH won!  Yay!! #TonyAwards
Loved @ActuallyNPH 's performance! #TonyAwards
Hugh Jackman is so talented! #TonyAwards   Great performance by everyone!

Bouncy, bearded Hugh Jackman! #TonyAwards

In one week, over 76k of us helped @ReadingRainbow, but we’re just getting started! Please join us: even $5 helps!

@BestThingFrom85 She will be greatly missed by humans and puppets alike...
Wow, turned it to TBS and just saw the creepiest commercial ever. #puppet
Oh yeah, Christopher is crazy jealous.  I forgot about that... #PetalsOnTheWind
Wow, they definitely took out some of the more controversial parts of this book. #PetalsOnTheWind
Oops, apparently it's #PetalsOnTheWind not #PetalsInTheWind
omg ten years turned Kiernan Shipka into a totally different actress! #PetalsInTheWind
Time to hate watch Petals in the Wind!  #vcandrews
@lifehacker I've been waiting for this!
@pinklem73 I finally got my DVDs!  I'm so excited!! #lizziebennetdiaries
@Gawker I am dissatisfied with this.
@PemberleyDig Great!  Thank you for responding.  I'm looking forward to getting them!
@PemberleyDig I still haven't gotten my DVD.  Should I be concerned at this point?
@pinklem73 I hope!  I mean, my address hasn't changed or anything!
@pinklem73 I haven't!  I'm starting to think I've been forgotten...
I am LOVING Tales of Symphonia so far.  So glad I finally got to play this one! #tales
Today's #MindyProject made me smile, which I needed today. Thanks, @mindykaling
Why did a bunch of Justin Bieber fans just follow me?  Did I get hacked?  You may not find what you're looking for on here, my friends.
Finally playing Tales of Symphonia!
One goddamn fucking cloud: Oh hey what’s up, bro? *flex*
Me: Really?
Cloud: Yo…
Who is up and ready for the blood moon?
@BestThingFrom85 I prefer to call it the live-action Gundam.
I forgot how awesome Pacific Rim is.  Freaking amazing.
@Kotaku NO, NO, NO!
@BestThingFrom85 Awesome!  Good luck! :)
@BestThingFrom85 That's great!  I loved grad school!

*(poorly)
@BestThingFrom85 It does seem like bad fanfiction from an angry Robin/Ted shipper.
@BestThingFrom85 Seriously ridiculous.  I am so pissed.
I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed, HIMYM.
NOOOOOOO!  WHY, HIMYM?  I AM SO UNSATISFIED.
@BestThingFrom85 My TV weighs like 200 pounds, so I think I'll settle for a shoe.
I do not like the way this finale is headed... Please don't be super predictable, HIMYM.
Watching the HIMYM finale!!!
@Jezebel EEEEEEEE!  Great news!
Watching Zoolander in my comfy pajamas.  It's been a long while since I've seen it.
My new favorite Kpop song: Happy by 2NE1 
My prayers and thoughts go out to everyone involved with the missing plane. #hopingforamiracle
@Jezebel Did I just time travel back to 2000?
Okay, I'm out.  Night, all.
@BestThingFrom85 But I wanna go to sleeeeeeeep...
Is it over yet?
Did I miss Idina?  When is this going to be over? #oscars
Please tell me it's time for Let It Go!
Yay, Lupita!
This is a weird Oscars, guys. #Oscars
@pinklem73 Although they are a gorgeous couple...
@pinklem73 They  had no idea what they were getting into when they were invited to be presenters...
Which of these actors/actresses are actually going to get up? #Oscars2014
This song does make me dance in my seat! #happy #oscars
My sleepiness right now does not bode well for a full oscars watch.  I fear I may be asleep before they get to the end.
@aprilismissing Hahah Yeah, I had it mostly muted for the first hour.
Oscars red carpet watch!
@pinklem73 She's awesome!
@pinklem73 Mulan is the best!  "Let's get down to businessssss..."
@pinklem73 hahahaha yay!  Validation!  *continues singing*
There are an awful lot of embarrassing personal Disney covers on my laptop.  What's the acceptable number to have? #disney
What is going on with Syracuse?!

@BestThingFrom85 hahaha if Syracuse beats Duke, I just might.
GO CUSE!!!!!! #BeatDuke
Syracuse, you did your best and that's all we can ask. #butyoureallyneedtobeatdukeagain
There are some days when you just blast Kpop.  This is one of those days.
@eatyourkimchi Did you guys see that the new Avengers will be filming in South Korea? 
@pinklem73 hahahah I have faith!
@pinklem73 hahaha yep!  I'll be screaming at the tv, for sure!
@pinklem73 I'm worried that they've overextended themselves, though...
@pinklem73 I know!  One of my coworkers asked me about it today and I was like, 'I can't take the stress!'
@BestThingFrom85 I'm dancing!!  We are the best!
WHEWWW!  WE ARE THE BEST! SYRACUSE! #UNDEFEATED
HOUSE OF CARDS MARATHON! #HouseOfCards Thank goodness for the snow day!
@BestThingFrom85 Thanks!
@BestThingFrom85 YOU KNOW IT!!!  WHAT A GAME!  UNDEFEATED! #goorange
@BestThingFrom85 Will do!  Stay safe!
@Gawker The word you're looking for is awkward.  It's just awkward.
@BestThingFrom85 Maybe, if their power isn't out as well
@BestThingFrom85 I wish I had one!  I'm most worried about losing power, though.  We're already out of school for tomorrow.
@BestThingFrom85 Are you guys as snowed in as we are?
@BestThingFrom85 The cup involves less physical pain, which goes to show how much I can really handle...
I live on the edge by finding ways to balance my cup on the couch.  I lose fairly often, but the rush is addictive.
@maureenjohnson The same is also true for Americans in South Korean TV shows (and probably North as well).
@BestThingFrom85 I feel like time moves faster the older I get, so maybe!
@BestThingFrom85 Same.  Making it through the day to day.  Can't believe we're getting so old!
@BestThingFrom85 Hey!  How's it going?
One of my less endearing qualities is that I dole out terrible book ideas to the world and say, "Ooh, you should write a book about that!"
Replaying Legend of Legaia, one of my old favorites.  #silentprotagonist
@TheAshleyClem I would also love a plus size princess :)
WE DID ITTTTTTTTTTT!!!

This game is going to give me a heart attack! #BeatDuke
@pinklem73 My neighbors probably hate me right now...
@pinklem73 If we're like this now, how are we going to be during the tournament?
@pinklem73 This game is killing me!
@pinklem73 I know!  What's up with that?
@pinklem73 I'm so nervous!!
This game is a nail biter! #BeatDuke
Whooo!!!  Duke v. Syracuse! Come on, Orange!  You can do it! #BeatDuke
#beatduke Go Orange!
Syracuse has a 6 point lead right now.  Keep it up, Cuse! #syracuse
5-9, Wake Forest.  Not happy.
Tweeted too soon.  4-2, Syracuse.
Cuse has a four point lead early in the game!  Go Orange!
Watching the Cuse game since I've got another snow day tomorrow!
Made snow cream! #snowday
@sundancefest 
@wilw As a librarian, that's my job every day!  It's fabulous!
@DarthRachel White Outtttt!!!
Flowers in the Attic was one of the weirdest books I read in high school.  Oh, V.C. Andrews.  Have to watch the Lifetime adaptation.
@io9 Whaaa??  These are some weird casting choices...
Watching the Golden Globes while I grade.  Feeling pretty meh about both things.
@comingsoonnet Whaaaa???
Just watched #AnAdventureInSpaceAndTime and really enjoyed it!

Priceless.
@EmmaApproved What is your favorite fictional couple? #AskEmma
@ms_cawley That's awesome!
@pinklem73 You know it!
@pinklem73 my students are going to be so mad that Cuse beat NCSU!
@Gawker A modern stowaway!
Every time I buy a new DVD, it shows up as a new movie on Netflix the very next week.  Does Netflix spy on its customers?
The last minute of New Girl was absolutely brilliant.
"The last one turned out to be pretty interesting." "What was the last one?"  "A hammer."  EEEEE
So excited that I actually get to watch S.H.I.E.L.D. as it airs this week!  #marvel
Playing one of my favorite games again, Shadow Hearts.  Love the judgment ring system on this game! #shadowhearts
@twitter Hey Twitter, fix the suspension of @TheAnnieTaylor and @FranklyChurch ! The fans of Emma Approved are not happy with you.
@pinklem73 I'm pretending to dance in my mind because my body is not moving from this couch.
Just downloaded the White Noise Ambience app and I think it's going to be awesome!
Ben Affleck as Batman?  Ehhhh...
@pinklem73 I know, right?  It's the worst...
Oh, @Xbox.  I was going to buy your console, but now I'll stick with Playstation 
@pinklem73 Did you know about the Library Hotel in NYC? 
Chuck Norris shaved his beard!  His immortality is now called into question.
Just beat Star Ocean: The Second Story!   Good, solid game.  On to Tales of Xillia! (Gotta get all my gaming in before school starts)
Another Saturday night of Lifetime movies and murderous women.  Where's the popcorn?
Following the live blog of the D23 Expo Live Action Panel on 
@eatyourkimchi castanets?
@eatyourkimchi Final Fantasy 7!  I used that strategy guide back when the game first came out in the 90s!
@eatyourkimchi It's on the PS2, but have you ever played Odin Sphere?  It's a side scrolling rpg, and it's gorgeous!
I bought dark chocolate covered blueberries a the grocery store today.  Bad idea.
Good luck to Peter Capaldi!  I think he'll do a great job!  #doctorwho
The new doctor is... Peter Capaldi!  I don't know who he is...  Google, here I come!
Doctor number 12!  Who will it be?
Just watching a Lifetime movie on a Saturday night.  You know, like you do. #lifetime
I can't even explain how annoying this constant nightly rain has been.  It may keep the temperatures lower, but it keeps causing brown outs!

@Kotaku Definitely FF7.  Nothing can top it for me.
@pinklem73 Yeah, I'm excited for a clean slate.  I didn't really enjoy Sanditon (the role playing is just not for me). Plus, I've read Emma
Totally got sunburned even though I put on several layers of sunscreen (SPF 50).  Grrrrr #sunburn
@pinklem73 The LBD crew announced their next adaptation to be Emma!  What do you think?
"She is too fond of books, and it has turned her brain." - Louisa May Alcott, Work: A Story of Experience...

@eatyourkimchi Have you guys heard about subbable?  
And Avengers 2 has a title!  Avengers: Age of Ultron! #marvel
OMG reading live blogs of SDCC Marvel panel is killing me!  Tom Hiddleston in full character?!
RIP, Cory Monteith.
@pinklem73 It's so sad.
What is going on with America right now?!  It feels like the past two months have moved us back centuries!
@pinklem73 Same.
Unfortunately there is no #justicefortrayvon on this day.  So sad for his family.
Going to see Pacific Rim!  EXCITED! #PacificRim
Praying that everyone at SFO is okay.
@pinklem73 Awwww if only
It's been awhile since I've played a game with a world map.  I miss it.
I love this game already #ninokuni
Already five minutes into Ni No Kuni and it's more compelling than FFXIII.
So Ni No Kuni, here I come! #ninokuni
So I was going to save Ni No Kuni as a reward for myself for making it through Final Fantasy XIII, but I cannot play any more of that game.
DOMA IS OVERTURNED!!! #itsagoodday

― Ge…
Adored Much Ado About Nothing!  #muchadoaboutnothing
Playing Final Fantasy XIII makes me want to throw my controller at the TV.  Poor characters, poor plot, poor battle system.
Finally playing Final Fantasy XIII.  It's pretty, but I really don't care about the plot and/or the characters.  They're kinda annoying.
So sad to hear the news of Lorna Elizabeth Tuck Colbert (Stephen Colbert's mother).  RIP.
Just watching some IT Crowd makes life much better
@MitchHurwitz I loved Arrested Development Season 4 from start to finish. Thank you for bringing it back to us!
@arresteddev Kristen Wiig was fantastic as young Lucille!
@arresteddev @BuzzFeed People didn't realize this was a joke?  Come on!
@RealRonHoward It's been fantastic!
I am loving all these cameos in the new season of #arresteddevelopment

@arresteddev I AM SO PUMPED!
I am so sad.  But at least we made it to the Final Four!
I'm pulling my hair out!
@pinklem73 They'll pick it up!  I'm digging my fingernails into my legs!
@pinklem73 This both saddens me and makes me laugh.  Conflicting emotions.
Pick it up, Syracuse!  I'm flailing around my apartment!
NOO!!  Syracuse! Defense!
I really like this Muse song! #finalfour
Ready for the Syracuse game!!!  Go Orange!! #syracusealumnigottarepresent

I could swear I just heard the TARDIS outside my apartment...
I just backed Twisted -- A New Starkid Musical on @Kickstarter 
Mamma Mia teaches us not to keep a diary of the conception of your child unless you want said child to find it and sing about it
@pinklem73 Also, you're awesome!
@pinklem73 :D
@pinklem73 hehe I'm sly like that...
@pinklem73 Did you see the Kickstarter for the LBD DVD?
I just backed The Lizzie Bennet Diaries DVD...and More! on @Kickstarter 
How is what's happening in Lima synchronized with NYADA?  #gleeworld
@pinklem73 OMG when you get home, grab some popcorn and hunker down.  Don't watch in a public place because you may squeal with delight
@pinklem73 YES!  It's amazing!!!  Have you seen it now?
I giggled like a school girl at today's LBD.  SO ADORABLE! #lbd
@pinklem73 ALL CAPS ARE ALL AWESOME
@pinklem73 OMG I know!  I can't wait for Thursday!
Glee, you're RUINING my childhood!  Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync?!  With the ropes?  Just stop.
@pinklem73 Maybe we'll be seeing some smolder in space!
I just backed The Veronica Mars Movie Project on @Kickstarter 
@JanMurray21 Daylight Savings isn't helping me either lol
Spotted Ashley Clements on the #streamys livestream!
I'm watching the #streamys to see if the LBD wins ALL THE THINGS!
@pinklem73 I don't think I can watch anymore.  It's just gotten ridiculous.  I liked Ali, too!
@pinklem73 I have no words.  Except those.
@pinklem73 I agree; this is a train wreck.
Not gonna lie, I love Valentine's Day.  Such a cheesy, fun holiday!
@pinklem73 Me, too.  We went from happy Pemberfeels to wallowing in tears.  I wasn't prepared.
@pinklem73 omg I cried.  So sad.
@pinklem73 I second that.
@pinklem73 The biggest of face palms.
@pinklem73 My sister and I are having an all caps conversation about it even though she's not watching.  Just ew.
UGH GLEE, every time you have character development, you seize up and move FIVE MILES BACKWARD. #glee
@pinklem73 Ugh, me too.  I'm so tired of it.
Finally addressed the fact that the Glee kids magically appear at all these places! #glee
Awww I love this Queen song.#glee
Greendale Babies!!
Watching Community!
@ms_cawley I agree, although I think it might have been difficult for him to get any money for his hair...
@ms_cawley Me too, that was pretty terrible casting.
@ms_cawley Maybe they'll sell them?  I can't wait for new Arrested Development!
I love The Mindy Project.  I laugh so much.

@pinklem73 Poor Lydia :(
@pinklem73 that was heartbreaking...
@pinklem73 That's the first and only thing I think of when I hear that song. GOB Bluth.
@pinklem73 Yeah, I'm actually surprised that Darcy admitted he was going to do something for the camera.  The press release was cute!
How do these glee kids have the money to always breeze off to NYC or go to Lima again, but can't afford a $400 bus to Indianapolis?
@pinklem73 hahahha Twitter has poor taste.
@pinklem73 Yep, it'll be something!
@pinklem73 I know!!!!  At least we have the Pemberley video tomorrow...
@pinklem73 I KNOW!!  They were so adorable, then so crushed!
@thelindsayellis Have you seen the Lizzie Bennet Diaries?
@pinklem73 Messaging you on Facebook the details.
@pinklem73 Pemberley released the video before Lydia's thing happened.
@pinklem73 Oh, watch the episode first on Pemberley Digital's youtube account.  I'll message you the thing about Lydia's downfall.
@DarthRachel @pinklem73 Yeah, I would definitely agree with that!  It's over six hours of content now.
@pinklem73 and Lizzie's phone is dead, so apparently Charlotte hasn't been able to reach her
@pinklem73 There's a Pemberley video, and also, check tumblr because Lydia's downfall has happened
OMG @pinklem73  Did you see what's been going on in the LBD universe today?
Me: Being awkward on the phone since I was physically capable of using a phone.  #sociallyawkward

@TheAshleyClem Just curious, but when did you all take the pictures for today's fabulous outing? #lizziebennetdiaries

@pinklem73 True... I actually would have preferred they didn't compete this year.
@pinklem73 hahaha not weird; just more thorough.  This whole Warblers/steroids plot is a little too far-fetched for me.
@pinklem73 I feel like this whole episode is a hot mess.
@Galinda0509 mwahahahahaha I would say you'll thank me later, but you probably never will.
@pinklem73 Yeah, that's definitely the feeling I get.  I want him to be gone.
@pinklem73 He seems emotionally abusive, talking about everything she doesn't want to talk about in front of the camera.
@pinklem73 omg, every lydia and wickham episode is making me really uncomfortable.  He seems to be manipulating her.
I'm seriously convinced there is something sketchy happening in the apartment above me.  There should not be this many mysterious noises.
@Galinda0509  While 27 yo me sits at home with green tea and a kdrama.  Have fun!
@Galinda0509 Awww
@pinklem73 Awww :)
@pinklem73 When I told my mom, I was shocked to find out that she didn't know the plot of P&amp;P.  The mother of a librarian, scandalous!
@pinklem73 On a side note, I've tried to get my mom into LBD, but it just wouldn't take, lol.
@pinklem73 Hahaha oh, that's not my mom, it was a reblog, but it was a funny picture, wasn't it?
@djlomackinson Haha your posts are much more articulate than mine.
@djlomackinson Apologies for all the Lizzie Bennet Diaries posts on tumblr. Feel free to unfollow me if it's too annoying lol.
@TheLizzieBennet What was your major in undergrad? #asklizzie
@JoeyAmmons Hahaha I can't afford to move, but maybe a visit would be fun!  I loved the special guests- gotta have some LBD in my life.
@DarthRachel  @JoeyAmmons I'm sure it will be awesome, so enjoy for the rest of us!  I'll probably watch the live stream.
@DarthRachel I didn't know you were going!  Is Joey going, too?  Have fun!
@pinklem73 Oh that's the worst!  I hope the anticipation makes it more awesome!
@pinklem73 I usually wait until after school but today I just couldn't.
@pinklem73 yeah probably.  I both love and hate the anticipation.
@pinklem73 I know.  I'm hoping for a q&amp;a on saturday.
@pinklem73 OMGGGG I know!!!!   I watched it on my lunchbreak.  I was giggling lol.  I'm at a workshop or I'd be blogging on tumblr!
@Galinda0509 You should tell that story at parties.
Congratulations @TheLBDofficial!
@ggdarcy @FitzOnTheFitz @kitbuckle You might say that he has ninja-like codenaming skills.
Gigi's the anti-Caroline!  I love The LBD! #pemberleyday
@pinklem73 I know; waiting is the worst! I think we're going to meet Gigi tomorrow, finally!
@pinklem73 Have you continued to watch?  I love this fandom :)
Tomorrow is #PemberleyDay !  How can I even go to work?

People who think my job is not stressful because "all I do is check out books to kids all day" #librarianstress
@mkwiles Wait until all your friends start getting pregnant.  Especially the guys.  It just weirds you out. :P
@Galinda0509 Aww the memories!
@Galinda0509 What has happened whilst I drove back to Raleigh?  The Mayans were off about the end of the world by nine months?
It's my birthday!!!
Turning 27 tomorrow.  Having to read large print on my laptop all of a sudden.  Coincidence?
Sometimes, I can be such a jerk.
I haven't had to scrape snow off my car since I lived in Syracuse.  I still hate it.
Stayed up til 1:30am playing Jungle Speed and Cards Against Humanity with the family.  Worth it.
@TheLizzieBennet NOOOOOOOOOO
Most families argue about politics or religion; my family argues about science fiction films.
@Galinda0509 Just don't eat it off of your car floor and you'll be okay!
I got Community season 3 from my brother and My Neighbor, Totoro from my parents!  I've got lots to watch :)
Merry Christmas!
Just got PERFECT CHAIN on the "Aerith's Theme" BASIC score from FF7! A cool 9049479 points! #TFF 
I voted for @TheLizzieBennet for Best Web Series in @tvdotcom's #BestOf2012! 
I like my apartment to be clean, but I hate cleaning.  Conundrum...
Look, Facebook, I know we've known each other for a while, but maybe you should keep the personal questions t… 
@mkwiles Really, the very best place to bust a move.  Sometimes, I enjoy a good Barnes and Noble groove as well.
@netflix You should have a shuffle button for TV shows so that I can just watch a random episode rather than pick one.

So what time is this end of the world thing supposed to happen tomorrow?  Because I've got a potluck and I wonder if I need to buy something

But it probably is Fhqwhgads
I asked my friend Joe
I asked my friend Jake
They said it was #Fhqwhgads

Wow,  Netflix just added a TON of Disney movies!
I can't wait until December 22, 2012, when NO ONE talks about the Mayan apocalypse again.  Seriously.
They're finally going to release the LeakyCon footage of A Very Potter Senior Year!!  Yay!
Netflix, seriously, thank you for fixing that messed up home page that you were using.
Ahh!!!  It's Always Sunny is on Netflix!  Yay!
I voted for @TheLizzieBennet for Best Web Series in @tvdotcom's #BestOf2012! 
Hey Cascade,  not all women care about cloudy glasses.
@pinklem73 I agree.  And next week they're trying a Love, Actually thing apparently.
@pinklem73 I was confused by so much of what was going on.  Is no one going to address Marley's condition?  Also, really, NYADA?
Glee continues to exist in an alternate realities where high school students only belong to one club in the entirety of their four years.
Why did anyone think water beds were a good idea?
So, one of my neighbors decided it would be a fabulous idea to blast their TV to its highest volume at 9am.  Thanks, neighbor.
Realization: For someone that says, "No worries" so often, I sure have an awful lot of worries. #neurotic
Watching YouTube videos of various musical numbers from Reefer Madness.  Ah, Saturday night.
@BrentSpiner Thanks! December is the best month for birthdays! :)
December dance party in my apartment commencing now.
@JoeyAmmons Glad to know you don't use Kim and me as things to barter with.
@Galinda0509 hahaha and people would see how many possible Facebook profile pictures I take of myself.
This new Facebook Photo Sync is probably going to end badly for many, many people.
Im nominating #AshleyClements @TheAshleyclem in #TheLBD @theLBDofficial for #BestFemalePerformanceComedy @streamys 
@JoeyAmmons Ummmm... Pretty sure they'd need to ask permission first.
@pinklem73 Will do :)
@pinklem73 Aww it's a pretty song!  And it does look like a Bond film.
@pinklem73 Watching it now!
@pinklem73 She's My Man is so odd!  It took me a minute to see what was going on.
@pinklem73 Kiss You Off is a fun video!
@pinklem73 hahaha Thanks!
@pinklem73 Hmm... I'll have to check it out.  That Turkey Lurkey song was...interesting.
@pinklem73 Tina always gets the short end of the stick.  Poor girl. I loved hearing Mike, though! I also weirdly enjoyed the weird SJP song
@pinklem73 I felt the same way about Tina!  I was like, "...Seriously?"
@pinklem73 I'm so mad at Marley for listening to Kitty.  She was already so evil to her; it's not like she could just change all of a sudden
@pinklem73 You were so right!  Because people's physical and mental health problems always manifest themselves during important moments.
I'm going to go ahead and guess that the Glee group is not going to win sectionals this year.  Ryan Murphy, always trying to 'surprise us'
OH WOW! Glee's doing Big Bang's Fantastic Baby!  One of my favorite Korean pop songs!
WOW.  Just saw an intense ad to learn more about shingles.  I may already be dead.
Apparently Rider Strong is too busy guest starring in crime dramas to be in Girl Meets World.

Insomnia is the WORST.
The King's Speech is on Netflix?  Awesome!
Whoops, this ad for Twilight just ruined it. #lizanddick
This ad for Dance Moms was worth watching the whole movie. #lizanddick
Liz and Dick!!!  I'M SO EXCITED.  It's gonna be ridiculous!
I'm just gonna go ahead and assume that every pop song on the radio is featuring Nicki Minaj.
If the more flashlights you have in your purse means the more prepared you are for a zombie apocalypse, I AM SO READY.

After hearing the initial reactions to Les Mis, I'm even more excited to watch the film! #lesmiserables
@ms_cawley Allons-y!
Just saw a Doctor Who gif and it made me want to watch my favorite doctor, Ten!
Aw, the women's gymnastic team from olympics 2012 in the parade!
@pinklem73 I can imagine!  Does it ruin some of the magic or make it even better?
PARADE!  My favorite part of Thanksgiving!
@pinklem73 Happy Thanksgiving to you as well! :)
I am not mentally prepared for all this Christmas music. #getoffmyyardChristmas
@pinklem73 Gorgeous!
The Thanksgiving episode is my favorite Peanuts of all time!
Watching A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving! #beaglehugs
The sound of something in my upstairs neighbor's apartment sounds like the TARDIS.  My upstairs neighbor has all the fun.
Today I'm thankful that I don't really like Twinkies.
WHAT?!  NOOOO!!  RT @Gawker Underage sex allegations force Elmo voice actor to leave Sesame Street 
@TheLBDofficial In the immortal words of Robot Chicken M. Night Shyamalan, "What a twist!"

Puerto Rico as a state can only bring more awesomeness to the nation.
Thank you, President @BarackObama, for sticking with us.  I'm proud to support you.
Didn't feel real until Stephen Colbert called it! I LOVE AMERICA!
Just as proud as I was four years ago in 2008! #obama
C'mon, NPR.  Call it!
You gotta love all the CNN anchors talking over crazy celebration in the background. #obama
WOOOOOOOO!!!!  YEAH!!!!!  #fourmoreyears!
Seriously, North Carolina?!  SERIOUSLY?!
Had to turn off CNN because it was making me hyperventilate.  Following NPR's results 
Come on, North Carolina!  Redeem yourself! #electionday2012
If you haven't voted, and you still can, GO AND PLEASE VOTE!  Let your voice be heard! #electionday2012
Enjoying CNN's ads for the election because they sound like we're finding out who won American Idol: Presidency Edition.
@TheAshleyClem Very similar plan to my evening (after work)!
And by takeover, I mean takeover of the world! #disneybebuying
Disney's takeover plans are coming to fruition it seems!
How is that I'm old enough for Topanga and Cory to have a preteen daughter?  WHERE HAS THE TIME GONE?!
Why, Prezi, why?!  Why did you have to change!
Watching The IT Crowd because it makes me love life.
@MariaOfTheLu @fandomspotting @TheLydiaBennet YES! Please do this!
#fandomspotting  Do you think we'll see Charlotte in different ways after they are finished with the Rosings arc?
Darcy Glances - So one of my biggest worries about The Lizzie Bennet Diaries (though I’ve adored them so far)… 
@wmdarcy Letter writing IS a lost art...
HA! Single women, FTW! 
@pinklem73 @DarthRachel  
IT'S EGGNOG TIME! #eggnog
@pinklem73 Definitely!
@RebelWilson It is the absolute best place to bust a move.
@pinklem73 @DarthRachel Someone in the comments suggested that maybe she becomes more formal around him because of the way he speaks?
@pinklem73 I can't believe all the states don't have it!  Good luck on Tuesday!
Good part of Christmas stuff being out early: eggnog is out!  Woo hoo!
Voting early is done!  So glad I don't have to worry about it on Tuesday. #getoutthereandvote
Going to try my hand at voting early once again...
Friday night = consume entire bag of marshmallows.
@DarthRachel @pinklem73 I've decided that I like this Darcy but with caution.
@pinklem73 People have said in the comments that maybe he's wearing a bowtie in the next one because he saw all of the videos.
@DarthRachel @pinklem73 Yeah, I didn't love him at first.  I also thought it was weird that Lizzie started talking the same way?
@pinklem73 So much emotion!  I've watched it like 10 times.
@pinklem73 Oh my gosh!
RE: Boy Meets World  This could also be everything I've ever dreaded.
@pinklem73 Have you gotten to video 60?  Please tell me you've gotten to video 60!
BOY MEETS WORLD SEQUEL SERIES?  It's like everything I have ever wanted!
@pinklem73 Such an awesome idea!  I'm so glad someone thought to do it! :)
@pinklem73 Have you been watching the Lydia Bennet videos as well?  (Also Charlotte's sisters videos?)
@pinklem73 Ooh, you're getting close to my favorite character; Fitz is off the charts awesome!
@pinklem73 Also, wasn't video 42 heartbreaking?
@pinklem73 YAY!!!  I am so glad!  There are so many good videos ahead of you!  Lydia, in particular, is amazing!
My apartment now smells like hot cocoa.  I don't know why, but I'm not going to question it.
Annnddd... my apartment now smells like burnt grilled cheese.  Yay.
OMG @wmdarcy is now following @TheLizzieBennet on twitter and I died.  This is fandom. #LizzieBennetDiaries
Socially Awkward Darcy is my new favorite meme. 
Man, I love being a nerd. #nerdalert
@TheLBDofficial @TheLydiaBennet @mkwiles @itslauraspencer @rachelkiley Laura Spencer and Lydia were amazing in this episode!
Someone I know needs to watch @TheLBDofficial so I can nerd out with them about Darcy and Lizzie! #teamlizzie
@wmdarcy Good luck with that! #teamlizzie
Tried to vote early but the parking lot was completely overrun.  How am I supposed to vote if I can't park?!
I adore The Mindy Project!

@AlliHarden I can't believe it's less than a week!
I can't stop watching this.  
So tired of Youtube's political ads.  Can't I just see an ad for something that doesn't make want to pound my head against the wall?

About to watch the new LBD and I'm SOOO excited!  #darcyday
No trick or treaters so I'm eating all the candy myself.  Such a shame. #kitkats #reeses #almondjoys #hersheys
If at any moment you see someone doing choreography from Psy's Gangnam style, run because you're probably now an extra in a parody video.
Love this version of Dr. Horrible's 'My Eyes' 
Kellogg's is now selling low calorie popcorn chips?  Popcorn is already low calorie!  Don't add chips to the equation!
@pinklem73 An invader Zim reference always wins! But, I'll be right there singing with you, too.
@TheLydiaBennet Who does the best impressions (like of Darcy)?  You, Lizzie, Jane or Charlotte?
@TheLydiaBennet Is there really a list of reasons why Lizzie is perpetually single?
Second attempt at a milkmaid braid!  Somewhat more successful.  I forgot how awesome it is to have long hair!
Attempted a milkmaid braid!  Not bad for a first time, but definitely not fit for the public.
@pinklem73 Hahaha I wonder if it's going to be live action or a cartoon?
A movie of Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day?  This could be  a reeeaaaallllyyy bad day.
Aww, they gave Mary and Kitty love interests, too.  How sweet. #prideandprejudice
Laurence Olivier was fantastic and Lady Catherine was fun! #prideandprejudice
While it was not a faithful adaption, I enjoyed the 1940 Pride and Prejudice overall.
I love how Lady Catherine De Bourgh ends up on #teamLizzy #prideandprejudice
They completely got rid of the part at Pemberley?  But..but that's the best part! #prideandprejudice
Did they get rid of the Gardners completely?  They replaced the Gardners with a garden party! #badjoke
"I, too, would have been a great proficient, had I ever learnt."  Lady Catherine says one of my favorite lines from Pride and Prejudice.
@pinklem73 She is quite an imposing figure!
@pinklem73 I'm at Lady Catherine!
@pinklem73 Charlotte is my favorite character in the Lizzie Bennet Diaries.  Her tumblr has amazing documentary suggestions!
"In marriage, happiness is just a matter of chance."  #prideandprejudice
Mr. Wickham certainly looks like a villain in this version! #prideandprejudice
@pinklem73 Yay!  Let me know what you think.  Here's a helpful website to follow the timeline: 
@pinklem73 I didn't love it at first, but now I really look forward to it.  The side characters are fantastic.
@pinklem73 They've been doing it since April and have just gotten to the Rosings arc.  They're trying to be faithful to the year timeline
@pinklem73 It's done as a vlog.  It's so interactive!  They use Tumblr, twitter, and Facebook to interact with fans.  Lydia is AMAZING in it
@pinklem73 Have you seen the Hank Green adaptation of Pride and Prejudice called The Lizzie Bennet Diaries?  It's pretty interesting...
@pinklem73 I can't wait!  Lady Catherine is one of the best parts.
Love how they threw in the line about being so proud and so prejudiced. :P  #prideandprejudice
@pinklem73 Laurence Olivier is adorable.
@pinklem73 Ooh, I haven't gotten to Lady Catherine!  I'm not too impressed with it, but then with Colin Firth to compare to, who could win?
Garden party instead of a ball?  Conversations around the archery range. #prideandprejudice
"There's something so unrefined about excessive laughter."  Caroline Bingley lol
Olivier's Mr. Darcy is quite different from the others.  #prideandprejudice
Watching the Laurence Olivier version of P&amp;P for the first time.  It's interesting how every version is so different.

Really enjoyed the debut of @FitzOnTheFitz on the Lizzie Bennet Diaries!  Can't wait to see more!
Twitter makes this debate bearable.
Is it really only Tuesday?  #alreadyexhausted
Watching Felix Baumgartner parachute from space.  Amazing! #edgeofspace #gofelix
Pitch Perfect was awesome!  So glad to see a good, funny movie again.
#videogamesigrewupwith Cosmo, King's Quest V, Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VIII, Xenogears, Legend of Dragoon, Zelda

So sad to hear about Michael Clarke Duncan.  He was an amazing actor.  #rip
Finding a Medieval well beneath your house?  Creepy but cool. 
I am so on board with #hitch2 with @azizansari.

RIP Neil Armstrong.  The world and beyond will miss you.
Just saw a commercial for Community season 3 DVD on Adult Swim!  Yay for marketing!
Children's author/illustrator Remy Charlip died a few days ago.  Fortunately, Unfortunately was one of my favorite books as a kid! RIP.

First episode to watch: Remedial Chaos Theory, followed quickly by Digital Estate Planning, then Basic Lupine Urology.  The rest in order.
Season 3 of Community out on DVD today!  Can't wait to get it :)
One of those background singers looked EXACTLY like Nicole Kidman.  Weird.
Say what you will about the London Olympics, but I think they've 'had a bit of fun' and so have I. :)
I cannot express how pumped up this song makes me #mrbluesky
SPICE GIRLS! My 6th grade self is fainting!
This is fun!  So many musicians! #closingceremony
I wonder if the Olympians just feel like they're at a concert.  #closingceremony
Ew, Russell Brand, go away, you're ruining it.
WILLY WONKA?  Oh, shit's getting real! #closing ceremony
I... do not know who this guy is.  #closing ceremony
George Michael, yay! #closingceremony
Watching all the athletes coming in and smiling is really cool! #closingceremony
@pinklem73 That is a good plan.  The live stream keeps freezing up on me even though I meet all the system and browster requirements.
Do we really have to have ads every two minutes, NBC? #olympicsclosingceremony
Finally got the live stream to work.  GRRR.
WHY CAN'T WE JUST HAVE LIVE COVERAGE ON TV, NBC?
And... live stream of the Closing Ceremonies is not working on my computer.  Sigh.
Dream team gets gold! #teamusa
BD Wong marathon of Law and Order: SVU on USA!  All right!
Every time I see a Romney political ad, I feel like the Republicans are still trying to convince themselves that he's a good candidate.
Why do I word vomit on EVERYONE lately?!  #soawkward
This music is so dramatic #olympics #gymnastics
Wow, this is so dramatic!  Inquiries are being made, people are running... #olympics #balancebeam
It's so hard to watch these girls fall, but they are amazing regardless.  #olympics #gymnastics
Balance beam is so hard to watch.  I would break my neck on that thing! #olympics
With the Joss Whedon news and the first day of Arrested Development filming, I am in nerd/comedy heaven!
WOOOO!!! Joss Whedon is writing and directing Avengers 2!  It's gonna be just as awesome if not more awesome than the first!
I did not know handball existed outside of my elementary gym classes.  Can you tell that I'm a nerd and not an athlete?
Watching Mixed Doubles Tennis proves to me that I really don't understand tennis.  #olympics

@djlomackinson @ginnabobinna442 That's what I'm here for!  :)
@GinnaBoBinna442 @djlomackinson We just have to get Loren to write a chapter in our book. :)
@GinnaBoBinna442 @djlomackinson  'Twas an epic tale of woe and injustice.  I think it was sophomore year?
@djlomackinson @GinnaBoBinna442  I do recall an incident involving pants that was quite awkward in its retelling.
@GinnaBoBinna442 @djlomackinson Yay!  Maybe we can all write it together.
Chick fil A used to be my favorite fast food restaurant, but I don't want to support a company who uses their money for bigotry.

Very intrigued by this live action Nausicaa short film 
@CommunityCult My first episode was back in season 1.  I watched Contemporary American Poultry and was hooked after Troy as a pharaoh!
@djlomackinson I kinda love it :)
Wow, that guy from the Arctic Monkeys totally does look like David Tennant! #olympicceremony
Caught a glimpse of Michelle Obama!  #olympics
Children's literature is so important it was featured in the Opening Ceremony!  GO BOOKS! #harrypotter #peterpan
I love how fun the London Opening Ceremony is!  #olympics
NBC, too much talking, not enough actual ceremony.  Seriously, live stream it next time.
NBC, why are we not seeing the Olympic Opening Ceremony live?  You are always so frustrating!
@pinklem73 Yeah, I want him to be the final torch bearer, like the Doctor Who episode, but I feel like that's probably not going to happen.
@pinklem73 Thanks!  I'm hoping to see the Tenth Doctor at least somewhere in the festivities.  I love me some David Tennant.
@pinklem73 Me, too!  My cable and internet keep acting up, and I'm hoping upon hope that they work tonight.
Counting down to the Opening Ceremony tonight!  #olympics
@JanMurray21 That sounds lovely! :)

Aw man, I just missed my favorite version of Cinderella being played on BET.  #whitneyhouston


@pinklem73 It makes me want to have a really loud and dramatic fake conversation in a public setting to see how others react lol.
@pinklem73 You never know what you're going to hear (unintentionally) :)
Overheard at Chick Fil A: Two guys having an INTENSE conversation about science fiction and fantasy novels.
Aww his dad is coaching him #walkthewire
Watching someone #walkthewire is a little nerve wracking
@djlomackinson If Broadway has taught me anything, it's that when you're broke and homeless, it's the best time to break out in song.
Neil Patrick Harris is awesome. #tonyawards
I love Matthew Broderick!  #tonyawards

I Wanna Dance With Somebody is one of my favorite songs to dance to.  RIP Whitney

It's days like these that I ask myself, "Why don't I own an umbrella?"  #rainy

@joeyammons You should watch Community.  HIMYM isn't really good anymore.
Syracuse lost, but I know we'll still come out on top this season.
29-14?   Come on, Cuse!  Pull it together!
Notre Dame is up, 19-10.  Not happy about this.
Got the Syracuse game on.  Come on CUSE!!  Let's go Orange!
Wish I could be at the #savecommunity flash mob today in LA.  #sixseasonsandamovie

@JoeyAmmons I miss that car
Please tell your cast I love your show. I'm watching every episode back to back. Thanks for the har ...
@JoeyAmmons  It seems like it's going to be awhile before they get it off the ground since they've already talked about at least 3 others.
@joeyammons  
@JoeyAmmons  Touche.
@JoeyAmmons But isn't he more qualified to make that kind of judgement?
It's cold in my apt. so I'm curled up with fluffy socks and hot tea in my new #littlemissscatterbrain mug
@DarthRachel Ice cream cake for the birthday win!
@JoeyAmmons haha you are forgiven.  High school is high school; it's like a different world.  Thanks for the birthday wishes!
@djlomackinson Insane.
@djlomackinson I was fascinated when they talked about the person with the crooked pinky whose path they traced.
@djlomackinson If I was in there, I honestly don't know how I would restrain myself from running off the path and touching all the walls.
@midnightchimera @djlomackinson  I found it when someone commented on an i09 post about it.  Isn't it amazing?

@pinklem73 How is his American accent?  Is it good?
Ugh, a Spiderman performance?  Yuck.  #macysparade
@pinklem73 Really?  That's so sad; he's fantastic!
Every time I see a number from How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying I really want to see it on Broadway.
I don't think I've ever been happier to wear a pair of khakis.

@JoeyAmmons  Check this out: 
@pinklem73 Ooh, I'm really curious about how it is!  Let me know if you like it!
@JoeyAmmons That way we could get presents that we know that they want rather than just random stuff.
@joeyammons I'd be okay with not doing presents for everyone, but I'd rather just pick a name out rather than it be secret.
@JoeyAmmons @DarthRachel  Jean Luc was an amazing kitty and I wish I could have hung out with him more.  He will be missed.
@joeyammons I'm sending positive thoughts to the poor Jean Luc!
@JoeyAmmons What?  Was it a result of the procedure? Poor Jean Luc!!  He's in my thoughts!
@JoeyAmmons @DarthRachel How's Jean Luc doing?
@JanMurray21 I'm in a Raleigh, NC elementary school!  It's been great!  How's SCSD?
@JanMurray21 My first paycheck didn't have me on the Master's education pay scale.  Yours is worse, though. :P
@JoeyAmmons haha, you're two days off of both Sam and Lily's Birthday.  Lily's is Sept. 10 and Sam's is Sept. 14.
@JoeyAmmons @DarthRachel Have fun at DragonCon!!
Power outages around North Carolina #irene
Trees rocking against my apartment walls #irene
Feeling some wind gusts from #irene in Raleigh, NC.
@pinklem73 Woah!  I'm not too surprised though, with the show's popularity and the new book coming out.
@pinklem73 Hmmm... I think I'll stop by the library to pick them up soon.
@pinklem73 @DarthRachel Books make my world go 'round.  :)  I haven't read GoT, but everyone has recommended it to me, so it's on my list!
@DarthRachel @pinklem73 Small world?
Almost time for #projectrunway Make it work!
@pinklem73 I'm a little wary, but at least we can reread the trilogy if the movie is terrible! :)
@pinklem73 Yeah, it's too weird!  Have you seen Winter's Bone?  I thought the girl who's Katniss was amazing in it, so I'm hopeful about her
@DarthRachel I second the disappointment.  The guy who plays Peeta does not carry the blonde look well imho.
I'm promoting literacy with @LeVarBurton by doing a #ReadingRainbowFlashmob.  Join us today! #launch 
@djlomackinson I agree!
@djlomackinson Can George Glass do this?........ Yeah, he probably could.
@djlomackinson I want to see it over and over again!
@djlomackinson Did you love bridesmaids, or did you adore it?  I could not stop laughing!
Glued to the news #binladen
I hope we don't have a repeat of the #sumonsoon today.
@Librarianess10 Unfortunately, I'm not getting a spring break (work and practicum), but I can Skype some time in the evening next week!
@Librarianess10 Everything okay?
@alphelps Good luck!  I just heard from Mark and he said that he's far enough away right now to be safe.
@alphelps He lives in Livermore, but when I talked to my mom, she said that he was at a conference in Pasadena today. I think he'll be okay.
@alphelps I know!  I'm also frantically trying to get ahold of my brother in California.  I hope I'm being overly paranoid.
@alphelps This is awful news!  I will also #prayforjapan
@Librarianess10 That's great!  Sounds like a lot of fun!
@Librarianess10 I vote fun!  How was it really?
Marry me, Colin Firth. #oscars
Toy Story 3 was amazing!  So glad it won! #oscars
I'm watching the State of the Union.  Are you? #sotu
@Librarianess10 Awwww... I'm right there with you!
@Librarianess10 I'm glad you made it back!  My brother was supposed to be back in NYC yesterday, but the flight was cancelled until Wed.
@Librarianess10 Kentucky's got a few inches, too!  It's freezing!  Did you get to go home for Christmas?
@Librarianess10 I just watched the first episode of Sing-off yesterday and loved it!
@DarthRachel Sounds like a great way to end the Halloween weekend!
Hope everyone has a #HappyHalloween
Hope everyone going to the #rally4sanity has an amazing time!
@ElizabethGall Wasn't it?  Shame on Marie Claire.
You can bet that Marie Claire won't be getting any of my money after the wildly offensive blog post they allowed to be put up today.
PURPLE!
@Librarianess10 Ooh la la!
Happy Mountain Day Eve, fellow Bereans!  #imissthepinnacle
I'm reading The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-time Indian this week.  What are you reading?  #bannedbooksweek
@hankgreen One time, in front of my three judgmental older brothers, I said epi-tome rather than e-pi-to-me.  #funnynowbutnotatthetime
@Librarianess10 Booo.
@Librarianess10 Aw, Suzanne Collins didn't want to be taped?  That's sad, I loved The Hunger Games trilogy so much!
@ElizabethGall All right!  Second years, ftw!
@ElizabethGall I saw your post on 616!  Did you change your mind about taking it this semester?
@Librarianess10 I totally didn't know what they were called, but I know we had them.  I always thought they were a little odd, though.
@Librarianess10 Oh my gosh, I totally used to play with those, too!  Did you have the bears as well?
Ooh, Cowboy Bebop's on.  It's been awhile.  #adultswim
@djfanboy so far, it's going well!  how's life for you guys?   so glad we got to hang out!
Hmmm... watch the Stephen King marathon on Syfy or read Hunger Games... what to choose, what to choose?
Just bought Hunger Games!  Ready for some good reading. #ilovebooks
@djfanboy I KNOW, RIGHT?
@aprilismissing I'm really enjoying this year's show overall so far.
The beginning of the Emmys just rocked my world #emmyawards
@djfanboy When I think of Phil Collins, I think of Tarzan :)
The moon is beautiful tonight #wellitsamarvelousnightforamoondance
@Librarianess10  What?  I can't call you broseph?  NOOOO!!!
It's like they made #scottpilgrim just for me.
@vanmar0521 I'm always excited when I have new towel sets :)
@kimammons Better keep that to yourself whenever visiting Texas!
@DarthRachel  @kimammons I think the giraffe probably challenged his authority, much the way Kim just did.  Beware!
@kimammons But can he do a roundhouse kick to the face of a giraffe?
You make quite a bold claim there. Please describe in detail why you believe this is so. RT @kimammons @OldSpice &gt; Chuck Norris
This is fantastic news: 
@Librarianess10 When did that happen?
The @oldspice guy could read nutritional facts off a cereal box and I could listen for days!  Loving this viral advertising!
Lesson learned: sleep deprivation makes me write entirely different words than I mean in emails.  #wordscramble
@Librarianess10 I miss 7-Elevens!
Keeping one eye on homework and another on the #worldcup
I honestly can't tell if there's a party upstairs, downstairs, outside, or in the stairwell next to my apartment.  #maybeitseverywhere
Just discovered that the yogurt that I didn't eat for lunch burst open in my bookbag and now it smells like blueberries.  #yogurtfail
@aprilismissing That is too funny!  Did the traffic director get it back or did he pull out another light saber and join him, lol?
@Librarianess10 Catching up on homework, sadly.
@Librarianess10 I hope you enjoy the fireworks in DC!  Wish I could see them :) #july4th
Oh no!  HBO just showed Home Alone!  Now I want Christmas to be here! #sixmoremonths
@djlomackinson Have you seen this? 
@djlomackinson haha, that's too funny!  How does one get that kind of job?
@djlomackinson For who?  WWE?
Turned on the tv and it happened to be on WWE.  This is way more of a soap opera than anything I've ever seen!  People actually watch this?
I'm Comic Sans! 
Jon Stewart just mentioned Jezebel on the Daily Show!
So... you may not know this, but my body runs on Chick-fil-A sandwiches, sweet tea, and waffle fries.  RE-ENERGIZED! #chickfila #sodelicious
Even though I am doing homework instead of lounging in the hotel pool, I still love my life!  #somanyfreebooks #ala2010
@Librarianess10 That's so cool!  Representing Syracuse, FTW!
@Librarianess10 My tomorrow 8:00 Session (maybe), 11: John Green signing, 12: Lunch, 1:30 Session, 4: Book cart Drill team thingy
@Librarianess10  How many sessions do you have planned for tomorrow?
@Librarianess10 I went to my 4:00 session and stayed until about 4:45 because it wasn't super helpful.  Then I watched the end of the game.
#ala2010 Loved the crowd of librarians at the convention center watching the World Cup game.  Sad to see them lose.
@Librarianess10 Maybe there's a conference for circus trainers and they have a booth FOR circus animal cruelty.  *thosepoorelephants
@realjohngreen I'm at the ALA Conference!  So excited about your book signing tomorrow!
@Librarianess10  Ewww, that's more gross than your fact about flies...
A paper to be written, several class discussions to be had, content analysis to be done, etc. #scottbaioruinseverything #headsmackondesk
Anyone remember the show reboot?  
@kimammons  Apparently that guy that you just retweeted about is a cousin of someone that is a Syracuse iSchool graduate student.
@Librarianess10 You're welcome!  The girls of 231 gotta stick together!
Why, oh why can't I be at E3 right now?
So excited about #tonyawards tomorrow.  Oh broadway, how I love thee.
Never thought about how real high school kids could pay for the copyright fees of the songs on glee.  What do real show choirs do?
@djlomackinson  I'll give you those two if you give me John Krasinski.
@djlomackinson So I had a dream last night in which I got to hug Joel McHale and tell Donald Glover about the time you saw him in the street
Can I get a montage scene for the summer semester?  #eyeofthetiger
Just beat KH: Chain of Memories!  #tooklongenough
@djlomackinson hahaha, well james mcavoy is pretty awesome, but my question is, will he be bald yet?  'Cause if he ain't bald, he ain't X.
wants to go Putt Putt golfing #wheresthenearestjunglegolf
James McAvoy is going to play Professor Xavier in the new X-men movie? I like him, but can he really follow in Patrick Stewart's footsteps?
Message to future self.  Take better notes in meetings where you are expected to later produce minutes.  #workfail
The beginning of the end. I spent all four years at Berea watching this show.  This shall be epic.   #lostfinale
Getting ready to watch the finale of Lost even though I haven't watched the last two seasons.  Here comes confusion! #lostfinale
Join this group on Facebook!  
@Librarianess10 Speaking of undergrads moving out, my roommate's bus got stuck in an intersection because of some undergrad's moving van!
@Librarianess10 What an adventure!  I agree about the food being worth it, though!

@alphelps I got my ALA membership, too!  Apparently I deleted the email I got on Friday by accident!
Is it summer yet? #imissthesun
@snyderrandall I didn't catch that part b/c I kept flipping back and forth.  How was it?
Nelly Furtado and Bryan Adams?  What a weird combo #olympics
ARGH!!
@djlomackinson Go forth and be awesome, my friend!
just voted "YES! Love him!" on "Neil Patrick Harris doing a good job at the #emmys09 ?" vote too ➔ 
thinking about getting a tattoo...
Playing a new game- I love new games!
Had some pretty strange dreams last night...
Just bought a new (used) car and loving life!
Loves some online Monopoly
Sick of hearing about the swine flu.  Can't the 24 hour news channels find something else to talk about for at least five minutes?
watching old episodes of South Park. man, I love this show.
Contemplating watching the entire Back to the Future trilogy because of a funny 11points list I saw when I was stumbling.
Learning how to use twitter.  Hmmm, this may take awhile...
