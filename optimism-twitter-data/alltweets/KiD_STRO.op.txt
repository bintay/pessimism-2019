Allow me to reintroduce myself.. to myself. #VisionQuest
S/O to @Junwar1 for favoriting my rant. #YouDaRealMVP hahah
I am me, I am more than enough, and I'm back. Promise this is the last tweet for this rant. #FnF #AttackTheDay
I love this momentum I've been able to gather up. Gotta keep it going and truly channel my efforts on a consistent basis.
I have all I need and I'm just happy to finally feel like I'm able to attack the world with an optimistic outlook and be/do better.
Now that I have moved past so much and regained this sense of security in myself I look forward to my outlook moving forward.
I was finally able to put many demons to rest today. So many little victories made today that I finally can feel confident in myself again.
@AwesomEmergency can we get a standing ovation for the music in the background during that last fight scene. #Arrow

24 is my favorite show and The Flash/Arrow are boss. But for in the realm of hero shows @Daredevil takes the cake no doubt. #JusticeisBlind
If only more superhero shows were adapted on Netflix.. I tip my hat to @Daredevil @Marvel and especially @netflix for taking it on. Amazing!
Salty salty salty. S/O @zachoflawtrades Okafor, Allen, Tyus! Let's gooooooooooo
Grayson Allen is the man. He's gonna be fun to watch next year.
On a more optimistic note, Paul George returns tomorrow and Chicago sports are looking strong.
I said this at the beginning of the season. I hope the Badgers make it the ship and get crushed. Best believe I'm a little petty ha.
@zachoflawtrades Shame on all the Marquette fans supporting the Badgers run. #NoLove #Traitors
@zachoflawtrades loving you favoriting my tweets. I'll NEVER support the Badgers basketball team. Let's go Duke!
@jabraham34 a free basket and a Dekker flop you forgot to add. But team defense and moment changing 3pt shot. #tippingmyhat #youcalledit
@MarquetteU @UWMadison This is shameful.
Gotta give credit though where its due, Dekker played huge at the end and the Badger Defense had huge stops.
Damn let all the chirping begin lol. Hope the Home boy from Chicago destroys Frank and the Badgers.
man I have a feeling that free bucket might haunt UK

S/O to the idiot Packers fan on First Take with the flipped upside down packers flag. Smh you look dumb.

Today was a day filled with conflict. Question of the day: do I get out of bed? The answer to that question was... 
What a run by Reggie Bush. Vintage USC form right there.
Lmao DPS staring me down hard after drifting past that corner. #FastandFurious #whipgame #noqualmsgiven
This is truly terrible news. He was a class act. #RIPStuartScott
Damn growing up I watched so much @espn. Stuart Scott was apart of my childhood and will forever be my favorite anchor....
That was a great fight. Loving the "suck it" motion from jones afterwards. Love it even more that he acknowledged his classlessness. #champ
Biggest challenge for the new year: removing the "tomorrow" mentality. Tomorrow never comes. Start today.
WINDY CITY ASSASSIN!!!!! #DROSE #SPLASH
MEGATRON!!!! Lookin real good. Another pretty throw by Stafford. 14-14.
@jabraham34 probably not until after the game anyway.
@stephenasmith usually I agree with most things you say but those are the rules. As soft as they have become that's the rule.
@jabraham34 not coming over for dinner either?
@jabraham34 when you coming through?
@jabraham34 Rodgers is hurt. Questionable return. Megatron just scored. 14-7 with less than a minute to go in the 1st half.
Nice toss by Stafford to Megatron. Only down 7. Lions really needed that. Solid game so far.
Damn it's only been two minutes and I saw this up on the Internet. I'm never one rooting for injuries. #Damn 
Cam Newton doing looking like SuperCam. Lovin this. #CamDo
Boom! That's one way to gain the swagger back! Such a peaceful day today.. Looking forward to the same. #LetsGetIt

Got a dope pair of sweatpants and fresh ass socks from my boy @jabraham34 
This is something to add to the growing list of awesome things I've done. This is the kind of night I've been waiting for in a long time.

I solved the riddle. Channeled my inner Batman and figured it out. #BeBatman
Most relaxed I've felt in a very long time. Best night of sleep in months!
@CantEatMy_Phil can't wait to watch Jax's last ride. Heard nothing but great things about the series finale

Thank you @YaBoySimon for inspiring me to watch Parks and Rec. I'm already over halfway through season 2. Too funny
Damn that easily ruined everything. Back to square one.
How quickly we forget! D ROSE BABY! 3pt FLOATER
#VoiceSaveChris
@YaBoySimon I'll hit up Netflix for it. Office dies off though once Michael leaves.
@YaBoySimon I'd call it a wash. I have to watch more Parks &amp; Recreation.
@jabraham34 the philosophy of "yet" shall prevail!
@JackGlowinski I saw a similar look in his eyes earlier in the season and then they went on a 7-game rampage.
@JackGlowinski I'm specifically talking about that instance, you could see it in his eyes. If they meet in the SB he's going HAM
JJ WATT FOR #MVP
@JackGlowinski yelling out fuck multiple times after that 3rd down conversion, thats desire and heart and obvious frustration but he cares.
I also counted upwards of 15 or so "fucks" televised on both CBS NFL games today.. all of which were meme worthy. Especially Brady's
Loved Brady's reaction today. That's a winner right there, if this becomes a rematch in the Super Bowl I'll go all in with the Patriots.
#JohnnyTouchdown
Manziel with the rushing TD! Let's go!
@DarthMooMoo come on now.. I'm still here. Let's goooo!!! Bulls all the way
Just met my wife today while trying to score tickets to a concert. Today was a good... Scratch that. Great day.
We might impress people with our strength but we connect with people through our weaknesses.
After an amazing Korean dinner I get to enjoy a solid beer at Comet Cafe. It's pretty dope once it turns into a bar.
Check out the Jurrasic World trailer! You will not be disappointed!
Definitely got airborne when I slipped on ice just now. Straight up Marv and Harry stuff. #HomeAlone
Lol mubb losing to New Jersey Institute of Technology. #dobetter


Finally the Star Wars VII trailer IS HERE!!!
Loved watching Guardians of the Galaxy again. #starlord
@SportsCenter @OBJ_3 back hurts from carrying the team especially after that incredible catch. #SCtop10
Arian Fosters performance in Draft Day is nothing short of Oscar worthy. #sarcasm


@Renee_Pratt thought of you when I saw this, you're welcome.

@livacich Art is wise.
@jabraham34 SALTY.

@jabraham34 dude can we turn your 2 day retreat into a year long adventure. I can't deal anymore.
Jay Cutler playing like Madden 04 Michael Vick. #speedfordays
Katy Perry on college game day is hilarious.
What a night. Did not expect it to end the way it did and for me to still be up.
NFL Draft in Chicago next year. I'll be there.
@jabraham34 so with the utmost sophistication! #jk
Probably one of my favorite posts. Gotta start using that phrase more often again.  
This game right now. Wow!
Caught my roommate singing Nickelback. Too funny
I think this is great. 
Can't believe that happened back home in Skokie. Thoughts and prayers out to the community.
And just like that... I'll be attending the Bears-Packers game at Lambeau. #BearDown
Packers deserved to win but the officials screwed the Bears quite a bit. Packers were pretty much perfect but we got a whole season ahead.
Anybody who understands football will agree that the refs have been pretty bad this game. The Bears have played like shit and the...
Miller park baby! Let's light up the Cubs baby! 
Driving is therapy, nothing better than cruising to Lupe and Cudi to collect my thoughts. Music appreciation at its finest. #FnF #MOTM

@Renee_Pratt Tsk tsk and you're in class right now. But I love this so much!
Finished Chuck last week. Got caught up with both The League and New Girl. It's time to enjoy a classic all the way through. #NP Scrubs!
Let the weekend begin!
Lmao at LeBron's new hairline
iOS 8 update is pretty fresh. Not mind blowing but pretty cool.
@jabraham34 cool rummings... one of the best ideas I've ever come up with.
@jabraham34 atta boy. You're doing it right!
COOL RUNNINGS IS ON NETFLIX. THAT IS ALL.

... I challenge whoever reads these tweets to show the people that matter to you some love by reminding them that they are important to you.
Last rant... We are only as good as the people we chose to associate with.. It's through them that we feel a sense of belonging and worth...
Complete side note.... Probably should find a new tv series to watch now that I have almost finished watching Chuck.
The intangible things will always hold more value to me. Not to point out the obvious but just a thought.
... things that matter and have value. You can always find value if you believe there to be substance and reason.
Finally got to that shining moment of clarity. Took a while but it's finally here. I'm prepared to focus and commit my time and energy into
Thank you computer for playing exactly what I needed to hear. Always can count on iTunes to shuffle me the right mix.
This day keeps getting better! The great news keeps rolling in and I have a 63 yr old comedian asking me ridiculously hilarious questions
"What's the hip lingo you youngsters crack at these days" the sweetest most hilarious old man I've ever met.
I'm loving this fall weather.
Kickball tournament for work today? This will be interesting...
This is why your Internet is slow. And it’ll get worse. Unless you take 1 min to do this, now. 
Truer words never spoken.  
@SpecialK312 it was really bad. I've definitely seen worst but I only say that bc the internet has desensitized me of violence. #crazy
I feel like some will take offense to this... but for those of you who can handle a joke. I'm glad I didn't draft Ray Rice this year.
Love the days where every song sounds perfect. On top of it all I have a half day today! #Clutch
Tough loss but Bears will bounce back! #BearDown #MonstersOfTheMidway
Thank God for NFL RedZone! Greatest purchase ever.
@jabraham34 I beg to differ.... 
“@espn: A college football box score you have to see to believe. 
@zachoflawtrades took Rodgers in the 4th. Gonna use him as trade bait. I also got Shady tho.
@zachoflawtrades that's the downside of fantasy. I've got Cobb and Rodgers and was rooting for points. But still some ppl need to turn down.
Damn so many haters on twitter. I may be a Bears fan but it's been one game. Packers will be competing all year. Show respect for the game.
Seahawks looked good. Solid first game of the season.
First day completed! Woot
The day is finally here! First day at my new Harley job!

Perfect picture to captivate the night with @Renee_Pratt. @katyperry was beyond amazing. #blessed 
The stage that Katy Perry is about to light up with her fine self. 
Might be at a Katy Perry concert. But he Bulls. #6shipsbruh 
Still got the bulls winning the East if the team stays healthy.
Just a week and a day left.
Guardians of the Galaxy. #win
Today has brought so much clarity that I can only be optimistic about how I'm going to change the world.
Today was full of surprises and unexpected adventures. Ultimately, thankful for times like today.

Tired of this routine, can't help but still think about the same things. Wish it didn't ruin my mood and shatter my mindset. Tomorrow.
Not as productive as I wanted to be but that nap was everything.
With that being done now I've got only a few more hours of work.
Last one, I will now attempt at sleep..

but first... 

let me rock out to an awesome song so I can sleep with a smile. #goodnight
I apologize for this twitter rant, dont usually do all this tweeting at once. Just airing out the mind.
Slowly but surely I become more right about what I thought was going to happen with my life and the world around me. #RealityCheck
on a more positive note... my music collection is really coming along.
night before an interview and im still up.. #classic
@zachoflawtrades yesss toooo funny.
@zachoflawtrades hurting.....
@jabraham34 haha the cat be trippin man. His pants are so low near the end lmao
@jabraham34 look at this bruh. 
@jabraham34 big changes and opportunity ahead for us my good sir.
@jabraham34 when you decide to.... I'm so down
Just one thought can change everything.. The decision has been made and my future has a clearer path. A little bit of faith goes a long way.
nights like these remind me of how its the simple things and random times that can turn anything around.
What a pleasant day trip home, back to mke now.
Do I stick with the plan or deviate altogether? One thing is for sure. It's a completely new ball game and I'm feeling like a veteran.
It's crazy how you can be so set on something just to see a completely different opportunity come out of nowhere.

No trip to South Carolina for me... Damn.
@jabraham34 if we end up going you should come too!
@jabraham34 yeah buddy. What are you plans?
@jabraham34 possibly. Me and Marc were debating going to see his parents new place in South Carolina.
And just like that I officially have no work during Spring Break.
Let's try and act like this didn't happen. Follow your friends like you ever had them.
Once
You're the first one in a long time that's had faith in me.
All I want is a place to call my own. Keep your hopes up high and your head down low. Music is my remedy. #ADTR
Love. Always. Shines. Every-time. Remember to. Smile. #LASERS #FnF
Focus. Patience. Faith. Dedication. All these things I usually have an abundance of.. but as of late have been losing each day.
Late night last night... long day today. #teamnosleep #RedBullSponsor

"The only thing standing between you and your goal is the bullshit story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't achieve it" #truth
Be strong enough to stand alone, yourself enough to stand apart, and be wise enough to stand together when the time comes. #inspiration
To the douchebag with the beats pill you're not cool playing your music obnoxiously.
Beat @JackGlowinski with a three for the win with steph curry. #BallSoHard

@nas_hussain we shall see. She gives me an adrenaline rush every morning so far. I haven't had to buy coffee lol
Making a Katy Perry song my alarm tone. Best decision ever. I wake up to an angelic voice every morning. #greatlifechoice
I love it when a plan comes together.
@Renee_Pratt I found it! 
#np The Man - Aloe Blacc... probably my new anthem. Love the soul within the song. With that I go to bed. #EasyListening
That Kendrick and imagine dragons collaboration tho.... #damn #TheyWentIn
Finally feels like things are slowing down. Hope it stays this way.
I think I've watched The Amazing Spiderman everyday this week. #IAintMadTho
@nas_hussain bro why are you playing like that..... Yo I think I might have off next Friday!
The pace that I'm working at compared to the lack of sleep I get is award worthy. Somebody get me a damn medal. #determination #teamnosleep
You know it's gonna be a long day when you wake up thinking it's Friday.
Lots of self reflection and reevaluation the past week. I'm looking forward to finding my peace tonight and finally get a good nights rest.
All these Richard Sherman haters. I love the swagger and anger, makes him a homie.
Ahhhhh Richard Sherman you sir are such a beast. Love that interview with Erin Andrews.

Found a transmitter so it can drive and listen to music. #SomuchKatyPerry
Welp this game is going to establish whether or not Cutler comes back next year. Career defining game for him in my opinion.

@jabraham34 I'm glad it has your stamp of approval lol
Tornado through LA scene in The Day After Tomorrow is so freaking awesome!
Haha at least the scumbag lions are eliminated from the playoffs.
Now it's about the bears!
What a return!
Ballsy 4th and 7 call by giants.
Another squandered opportunity by the Giants. They deserve to lose now.
@zgeren72 and Eli ruins it. Onward to OT
Watch a clutch sack for the giants!
@jabraham34 brightside lions just threw a pick six so that game is tied now.
Yes I'm a bears fan rooting for a packers win. I want it to come down to us versus them.
@jabraham34 you look good now. Y'all have to ride that momentum!
That was a dirty one handed interception by AJ Hawk. #SCtop10
The giants need to step it up. But this steelers-packers game is too hard to turn away from.
Roethlisberger with the rushing TD. Looked like the pillsbury doughboy getting chased after by a fat kid.
What a fake punt!
@jabraham34 atta boy those are some classics. Christmas with the Kranks is up next in the queue.
@jabraham34 yes!!!! I'm watching this everyday until Christmas.

It needs to be Thursday night already.
Finished everything wayy ahead of schedule... Where was this motivation/beast mode during break? #sleeptime #RBAIA
Fantasy points Alshon. FANTASY POINTS BABY. GET IT. EASILY ONE OF THE BEST CATCHES OF THE YEAR. #LETSGO

I'm so happy Jamil is finally getting his on the offensive end. 20 pts at the half.. Let's goo
Marquette Basketball time... As soon as I get a damn stream.
That was terrible football by the packers. Makes life difficult for the bears but it makes that end of the season game much more interesting
This game is so hard to watch. The Packers are just playing awful football.
Just pulled off my first successful J turn. I'm clearly impressed with myself. #drifting
Saddest news I've heard in a while. Derrick rose is out for the remainder of the season. #depressed
On a more positive note: just in 15 mins a saved a ton of money by switching to geico. #notreally #optimisticish
Ohh man I've got 4 presentations in one day. Guess that's what happens when you only have one exam during finals week. #suddenrealization

So let's count the days as we get by. Cause we'll get by.
Here I am wish you a happy Monday! #photoshoot #workit 
@JackGlowinski no way man lol money ain't a thang. Slap bet. The winner gets as many slaps as it takes for their team to secure the title.
@JackGlowinski I'll be nice and just say that they win the World Series.
@JackGlowinski Are you willing to slap bet this prediction?
@JackGlowinski tsk tsk sir. Tsk tsk.
@JackGlowinski pish this was decided when you started rooting for the cardinals. #traitor

..... Because I spend more time regretting things I don't say rather than the things I do.
Being up for this long has thinking about all the little things I keep to myself.. and how some of those things are better off being said.

Bradley just said he needs to look at the tape to see if he won. What a joke. #TeamPacquiao
@briankeefe4 Absolutely ridiculous. UFC &gt; Boxing. Now I know the world is coming to an end. #2012
11 of 12 rounds to Pacquiao EASILY. This is why UFC &gt; Boxing.. Corrupt ass sport. #FuckBradley
