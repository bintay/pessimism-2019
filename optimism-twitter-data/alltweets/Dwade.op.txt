@yusebio Hmmmm, definitely going to need a second source on this.
@AmeriGunner I’d say that the question is unlikely to yield useful information, but maybe that’s not their intent…
@jacobdfriedman I get half of whatever you bet!
@AmeriGunner And yet, that is nowhere near the largest issue with that survey
@jacobdfriedman Zenefits'
@jesseberger That makes some sense, but I can’t think of too many brands I WOULD defend to the death.
@sabometrics I know! What level of desperation have you reached when “I would defend Reese’s no matter what” is a viable option?
I have no idea what information they’re trying to get here, but I think Reese’s might be starting a private army... 
@jon_bois everything is illuminated
@fmanjoo @mathewi It reminds me of most infographics: People can like it and  get useful info from it, but it’s PR/Marketing at its core.
@mccoveychron @mallelis I’m shocked to see “Everything is Illuminated” not on there!
@eveewing No pressure tho.
@zvsanders They played with that a little bit in 3, too. It was rocky, but definitely a nice change of pace.
@zvsanders Black Flag. I’m not there yet (I’m militant about playing them in order) but I’ll probably finish 3 in a couple weeks.
I’ve said half a dozen times that I’m so done with this series, but… 
@sporer @MikeGianella He’s maddening to cheer for because his game is SO untenable. And yet, somehow he keeps being…well…functional at least
@ajwalsh08 Stop.
I’d like to thank @FanSince09 for the fact that I briefly referred to the Phillies’ ace as “Coal Hamels” before catching it tonight.
@ajwalsh08 Probably the goat’s fault.
@cowsarecool220 almost certainly. The cats don’t cuddle much, so that would match the cold theory.
I stood up for all of 10 seconds! #CatsAreJerks 
The string of Brady/BENGHAZI tweets lead me here: 
@lonestarball I think I could hate-watch one episode of that before going absolutely insane.
@thesideofmyface I’ve had the same thought about 10,000,000 times.
@thesideofmyface Whoa, whoa, whoa, let’s not say things we don’t mean. Corporate offices are nothing BUT bullshitters.
@ParkerHageman @jdgoin The man discovered the new world!
@enosarris You aren’t already there?
@ironmikegallego @hangingsliders Seems like the fact that they actually had a hand in the wrongdoing would cover the Patriots.
@PhilMackey Legal hedging in the report vs. extra legal disciplinary proceedings, I guess.
@TaylorTwellman No sense throwing good brain cells after bad...
@numberFire I want to live in a world where Roger Goodell has a d16 in his desk for occasions like this.
Tom Brady’s about to get Wally Pipp’d by Jimmy Garoppolo #BookIt
@w4desworld probably true. Oh well, I can explain what I mean if it comes up...
@HautmannOnFOX @NFL The lesson here: Never, ever lie to the league.
So Tom Brady’s crimes are about twice as bad Ray Rice’s were. Got it.
@keithlaw @hangingsliders And a “team" is a collection of individuals banded together to work toward a common goal.
Until immediately after he misplays a ball for the first time. 
@petzrawr @FanSince09 You spelled #FOYS wrong. (Sorry, just bitter about today’s game. Stupid Gomis…)
@RealBrettGordon @FanSince09 Villa was another one I thought of: Tend to pay a TON of money for a star, who then magically turns to dust.
@FanSince09 Maybe Tottenham? Decently well-off club with terrible management.
Somehow, both Man U and Arsenal will have 80%+ possession on Saturday and still manage to lose.
@CadChica @Sportsmanias @vicentesports @mcuban We may not be an athletic powerhouse anymore, but @UChicago sure has a huge impact on sports!
@CompleteArse Don’t we all!
@CompleteArse He had random games like this with us too. Out of nowhere he’d come up with save after save…then let in a howler.
@DestinyTheGame Thorn. Always thorn.
@Heisenbergkamp Is it still performance art if the performer doesn’t know he’s performing?
@TheShortFuse @NBCSportsSoccer Cosigned. #NoSteam #MasTacos
@FutbolIntellect Has the ship sailed on them playing Stoke-style football in Temecula?
@CompleteArse BANGARANG!
Happy 10th birthday, Leeroy! (h/t @nnelson9) Thanks for giving us a go-to name for crazy, aggressive people. 


@bosoxholic Nice, thanks!
Word. 
@bosoxholic No later than 12:30-1pm. I think we probably need to be in Anaheim by 4 at the latest.
People who drive in SoCal frequently: How bad is the drive from LAX to Anaheim? Flights into SNA are suboptimal, but workable if needed.
Today in “Wow, I guess everyone has a trade journal/magazine”: American Drycleaner!
@Dave_MN @dbrauer @PhilMackey The question is whether they’d give him the freedom he wants. Also, they have NFC rights; he’s an AFC guy.
@Dave_MN @dbrauer @PhilMackey Yeah, if they did a weekly studio recap show with Simmons hosting, I bet he’d be thrilled.
@dbrauer And maybe that works for him ala Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh, but I think it does limit his theoretical upside as well.
@dbrauer I just…Bill isn’t the most enlightened writer out there. With the reins now totally off, I wonder how many people he’ll offend.
@dbrauer I guess I’m inclined to agree. I’d be interested to know how much editorial oversight he had at ESPN. How much will that change?
@dbrauer @PhilMackey Who was the last media member to build a true empire? Limbaugh?
@PhilMackey @dbrauer If he can bring that following with him, even just 40-50%, he’ll have a Day One audience to sell against.
@PhilMackey @dbrauer The social aspect here is a total wildcard to me. Even now, Beck has less than a quarter of Simmons’ following.
Looking for a good desktop client for @asana. Given these warnings, someone’s having way more fun with it than I am! 
Bad person has bad opinions about beer. #Subtweet #WojIsABadPerson #TwoHeartedIsAGoodBeer
I wish you could all feel what it's like to be part of @UChicagoScav, especially to be a Judge. What an awesome group to be with last week!
As always, the Scavenfeast was INCREDIBLE. Thank you, thank you, thank you to the Scavvies who participated!
@emmaspan I think you're right. It seems stronger to assert what something IS rather than pointing out a thing it isn't.
Hey editing folks, is there a preferred style between "It isn't" and "It's not"?
@emmaspan Oh man, I didn't know they'd made another film! A TALKING CAT is a priceless gem, and an old favorite of @UChicagoScav
@emmaspan I feel relatively intact, so I'm going to go with funny bad, but it is weirdly dark for a children's movie.
@emmaspan If you are looking for a new addition for Bad Movie Night, let me recommend Russell Madness. It's...bad.
@PFunkLange YVAN EHT NIOJ!
@cdgoldstein Could be. I'm AfK, so I'm not exactly looking at the data either.
@cdgoldstein Those strike me as two sides of the same coin. We've seen GB guys do insane BABIP seasons, he'll probably one at some point.
@cdgoldstein Just being a GB guy like he is, I feel like it's extra true for him.
@cdgoldstein Like, I'd be less surprised to see him get shelled every month or so than I would be to see him just slowly slide back to mean
@cdgoldstein I don't disagree, but I do feel like he's a guy who could outperform his peripherals by sheer luck.
@cdgoldstein Pelfry is going to get eaten by the regression monster, but I have some hope that Gibson won't fall as far.
@ajwalsh08 is that good? I feel like that's pretty good.
@dbrauer @DeRushaJ Is that before or after the Two Minutes Hate?
RLRT: "Is Candy-ass one word or hyphenated?" #Scav2015
@ajwalsh08 Sadly no, but I'm proud that my copious baseball references have outlasted me. @Parker_Adderson has most of them.
@Tepper Very thin membrane between the powder and the bloodstream. Gets the cocaine into your system more quickly.
@SethTweets @Brandon_Warne If anyone is mad about him turning into McCutchen, they don’t understand how rare that kind of talent is!
@SethTweets @Brandon_Warne He CAN, Mike Trout DOES. I’m not debating his talent at all, but making Trout the expectation is too much.
@Brandon_Warne @Ex_Twins_News Didn’t a scout drop a Willy Mays comparison at one point? THAT is aggressive.
@jpl486 Negligible!
@mike_marcotte @StarTribune @citypages According to @dbrauer, yes, they’re going away. Shame really...
@sabometrics I would tend to agree with that. Baseball’s connection to its history/records is another huge piece of this puzzle.
Hot Take: Tom Brady’s cheating affected actual NFL games more than Alex Rodriguez’s affected MLB games.
@ajwalsh08 I was only there for a day or two, but was really impressed with what I saw. It’s a nicer city than I expected!
Congrats to the Seahawks on their retroactive Super Bowl title! #DeflateGate
We’ll miss you, @erikmal  
I’m going to go out on a limb here, bear with me, and suggest that the sheep are…grazing?  
@matthewcerrone Viva the AL and NL Central!
Really, really important stuff: Valuation As A Scorecard 
@RonSRosenbaum Well, it's Blues playoff hockey for sure. Also: Twins playoff baseball on ice!
@Chicago2Chelsea @panndder See…I can’t do it. Lou’s just isn’t as good as Giordanos. Gino’s and Uno are both clearly second tier.
@enosarris @injuryexpert Small batch has an actual number attached to it, though, I believe. They have to stick to the softer terms.
@injuryexpert I’m cautiously optimistic. Geno’s did not franchise well AT ALL, but I’m hopeful Giordano’s will do it better.
@injuryexpert I don’t believe it’s open yet, but you’d better believe I’ll be there as soon as it is!
It breaks my heart to see so many bad opinions about Chicago pizza in @panndder’s mentions. #GiordanosForLife
@DeRushaEats @panndder @nicholaskolnik @lizzie_b Great, yes, but all equally inferior to Giordano’s, the king of all foods.
@Ceetar Kiss glass
@a_ettel It’s clear that their peak valuation will be well over that $3b, but timing is everything, so they could still get far less.
@a_ettel It’d be fascinating to see how they did. An astronomical amount of brand recognition, but some churn and questions about leadership
@KevinDeShazo It’s nowhere near dead, but neither was MySpace at its peak. Staying power is what I’ve always questioned.
I looked like an idiot when I said that Snapchat was the next MySpace in 2013, but maybe it wasn’t so dumb... 
@mallelis @ben_machell Did they do a thing though? I thought it was just him and Natalya in that one.
@Brandon_Warne @RotoPat Club sports or intermurals. #CaptainOfTheUltimateTeam
@amandarykoff @dianagram @Chet_G @Tepper Ok, see, that’s totally fair. I thought you just irrationally didn’t like them and I was sad.
@Tepper @amandarykoff 
@amandarykoff @dianagram @Chet_G @Tepper Wow. WOW, I feel totally blindsided here. I’m just…wow. Do you like Italian, can we start there?
@dianagram @amandarykoff @Chet_G @Tepper Solid, solidly behind Thai, Vietnamese, and probably Chinese as well IMO.
@LOUisButIsnt @dianagram That makes you the second person in the last 10 minutes! Plus Versace last night and the First Lady in February!
@harrypav @dianagram Look, I try not to judge people’s predilections…
@dianagram “OK, so the deal is Mastroianni for 10 units of Apple stock, all the change in your ash tray, 40,000 Lira, and 10 yen. Good?"
As in the phrase “The #Phillies have sold   OF Darin Mastroianni to the #Nationals.” Conserves words, too!
I say this every time someone gets “traded for cash” as Mastroianni just was: Sold. We have a word for “traded for cash” and it’s sold.
@davidwiers @sporer As a side benefit, I now know that the Spanish word for grandmother is abuela!
@davidwiers @sporer They had a promo that played any time you were between on-demand shows on comcast. I probably saw it 152 times.
@sporer @davidwiers Does that mean you already possess the talking monkey named Boots?!?
@panndder but also: dooooooooo iiiiiiiiit!
@panndder plan on an Uber home, that stuff kicks like a mule!
@Chris_Cwik @harrypav I just tell ‘em the truth: I’m physically incapable of getting a good haircut.
@zvsanders Sorry 2 get ur hopes up.
@zvsanders The standing rule is that as soon as I get 1,000,000 followers on Meerkat, I’m livestreaming my own snuff film.
@jessespector @scohenPI Gonna need some DNA tests on those kids to verify their parentage.
@zvsanders I contain multitudes, each worse than the last.
@Chet_G @amandarykoff @Tepper Also strong. Vietnamese might be the king of all east Asian food genres, but that’s a tight race.
@Tepper I mean…Thai though...
@dturkenk @MikeGianella I’m not even mad, I’m amazed. I love Trotsky jokes, but they’re not so common in the wild anymore, you know?
@MikeGianella OMG is this a Trotsky joke?!
@simonbrundish Most of ‘em make it up. If there’s logic behind it, it makes it even easier for people to believe/report as true.
@hangingsliders only thing I can think of is that it keeps the pitcher in the windup instead of the stretch. May or may not matter.
@FSNtylermason Jason Tyner: DNP
@andymoney69 and yet, still SO much better than "Cinco de drinko"
@Brandon_Warne "We want unlikable players to be monolithically unlikeable!"
Man, everyone hatin' Torii is boorish. That’s a grade-A bat flip no matter who does it!
Wow, that’s KBO quality! 
@ParkerHageman Absolutely no reason to throw him anything in the zone right now. If it’s close, he’ll take a cut at it.
@lukebcarman I’ll let you know if I come up with any other random middle school math issues!
@lukebcarman whose half circumference is 22 inches?
@lukebcarman Basically, I want the beach ball as close to 13 inches as possible. Should I get the one that’s 16 inches deflated or the one..
LRT: even Versace knows I'm fly til I die, yo!
@jlwoj @Chris_Cwik It’s a coffeemaker, which tend to cost much MORE than $30. Pays for itself in like two weeks.
@Chris_Cwik Get an Aeropress! No smalltalk and cheaper than cafes
@dorkkly Esp. when we’ve still got the FA Cup Final!
@Adam_Jacobi This is your fault somehow. 
@NextTopSIRModel I’m actually very proud of myself that I could quick calculate it out. Also, I hope you’re sorry for that pun.
@dturkenk Thai. Always Thai.
Also, to the company who thinks listing 1/2 circumference when EVERYONE ELSE lists the diameter is acceptable: You are bad and wrong.
People who say they have never used geometry in real life have never tried to purchase beach balls for a trade show. #NonstandardSizes #Math
HAPPY SAINT TOTTERINGHAM’S DAY EVERYBODY! #AFC #ForeverInOutShadow
@jessicahalem @eveewing I will not have you besmirching the fair name of Micahel Dukakis! #DukakisForever
@DailyCannon Already deleted, what’d it say?
@mattlindner “Reporter” “Liar” same thing, really. #SMH
Harper hasn’t moved on either of Arsenal’s goals. Not that he could have done anything with either deflection, mind, but still 0 steps total
The #BPL season is pretty much over at this point, but I’d still love to see a 6-0 thrashing today #Arsenal
@TheShortFuse Didn’t Cesc score one off of Gallas’ face like that a few years back?
Hey @mattpuettmann have you seen this? 
@MyHumera I have too much respect for @amandarykoff to suggest that the Astros would pull such a stunt. (Good suggestion though!)
@Swydan @zvsanders @davidwiers @CrawfordChrisV @JP_Breen @Jake_NFL “Chief Stone Throwers” seems more accurate.
@jh_moore Much like Anakin!
@Chris_Cwik @jon_bois Dave’s not here, man.
Have the Sox dressed up Dustin Pedroia as Yoda and made him say “Judge me by my size, do you” or did the Royals steal that with Tim Collins?
@SubtweetCat do you cut down the salt when you add them or nah?
@nnelson9 @DerekWetmore Assuming he continues to play well, it creates an interesting roster decision once Sano proves he’s ready.
Charlotte is a lovely name for the #RoyalBaby, but I was really hoping they’d go with something more notably British like Ringo.
@FutbolIntellect @ESPNFC More pressure when Ronaldo and Bale are on the ball?
@harrypav @octonion Mine’s a little more Cubist. All the elements are there, but they layout never quite matches reality.
@MikeBerardino Tony Campana is the best one I’ve got, but Robbie Cano isn’t bad either.
Good heavens, White Sox. What did you DO during spring training?
@bruce_arthur @Lana A UK betting houses was giving 500-1 odds on the baby being named Ringo, which I think is a lovely name for a princess!
@CompleteArse No worries! I’ve really liked the new Matt and Kim album (
#PLOOOOOOOOOOOOUFFE
@Lana Is that better or worse than going on an Ebay spree?
@CompleteArse You looking for something mellow and relaxing or something upbeat and energetic?
@eveewing @windmillchaser0 Pfft, corn is no place for a mighty warrior
@windmillchaser0 @eveewing Have you tried a wave of babies?
Your #100PercentGuaranteedLockOfTheWeek* parlay is American Pharaoh in the Derby and Mayweather in a decision.
@RotoPat at a position other than Kicker?
Will be very interesting to see if the Union — who thoroughly abandoned A-rod in the penalty phase — will fight this 
@ironmikegallego by the 55 gallon drum si vous plait.
@AmeriGunner @BlancaPena29 @Matt_Schwarm4 @GirlWhoLovesAFC I’d say that’s creepy, but I make pretty much no bones about who I am!
@BobbyBigWheel Folks who have worked/work with his production company mostly.
@BobbyBigWheel Oh yeah, dozens.
Really looking forward to SAS throwing his colleague and teammate under the bus on Monday so he can continue to carry water for Floyd.
Re: 
@dianagram He’s already illiterate, that’s pretty close to a permanent disability...
LRT: But we knew that. He may be the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world right now, but Mayweather is nothing but an illiterate coward
@lukebcarman the CTA remains the world’s greatest melting pot (and is about hot enough to melt flesh most of the year too!)
@SethTweets #NotADinger tho...
@teen_archer I think that’s called a gun and it’s not so much an app as a real thing...
@emmaspan A man’s gotta have a code.
@TheTomasRios I’m unclear how he appeals to ANYONE, irrespective of race.
@ManuclearBomb @MikeBatesSBN Tranform and Roll Out!
@ManuclearBomb Knowing Jay, it’s probably at, like, the Cheesecake Factory in the Hancock tower.
@MJ_Baumann Going to be hard to find that on a novelty license plate #Bort #MySonsNameIsAlsoBort
@MJ_Baumann Maize? Like…the other name for corn?
@Lahlahlindsey (Of the big four sports, that is. Monster Truck fans were…frequently unpleasant.)
@Lahlahlindsey I think it’s less area and more sport/league. I used to park cars at the Metrodome and the NFL fans were the worst by far.
@dankuckuck The modern rain dance. Sometimes the old ways are the best.
@michaelcbarr Probably equivalently accurate, tbh
Apropos of nothing, Joe Mauer might break 50 career steals this year. Billy Hamilton might get 50 before the ASB. #TheMoreYouKnow
@KevinDeShazo I agree there. I’d love to know what inspired him to do it, but the answer is probably: Just goofing around.
@KevinDeShazo I think he means, it was for entertainment, but it was for his own rather than his followers'
@ManuclearBomb Yeah, the game. He’s the ghost (the little robot thing that flies around with you) The script was AWFUL, he didn’t help it.
@ManuclearBomb After the way he mailed in Destiny, I don’t assume anything from him anymore.
The funny thing is, even if Cardale DID go to Akron, don’t the Buckeyes still have like a half-dozen bluechip QBs to audition?
@howardmegdal While true, I believed it for markedly longer than I did any of the April Fools jokes I saw.
@KALuther related: 
@KALuther “Come on, man, I had no idea she was your sister!"
@ManuclearBomb @ironmikegallego You mean like every Ronda Rousey fight ever?
@ManuclearBomb No, they’re going to box defensively and mostly dance around. @ironmikegallego knows more, but I’d bet the farm on no KO
@ManuclearBomb Even that MASSIVE issue aside, it’s just not going to be that good a fight.
@BLarsenAFC1886 In a heartbeat, but do you think anyone would pay it?
@jonbernhardt Especially, as we found out in the Eric Garner case, they don’t mean terribly much yet.
@ATallOrder I ran for house president on a platform of 54’40’’ or fight because I wanted to steal a former Canadian suitemate's room!
@mattlindner Would you accept a hasty photoshop/MS Paint of Jameis’ head on a crab’s body?
But seriously, if you don’t listen to “My Name Is Jonas” at least once on May Day, I’m not sure we can still be friends. #Weezer
@WattsMR <RAISED FIST>🏻
Happy May Day, Comrades!
Whatever color Steve Balmer’s face is at the end of this #CLIPPERSvSPURS game should automatically be the pantone color of the year.
.@UFStemCell I don’t usually do this, but you almost certainly want @DwyaneWade
@MikeGianella General soreness.
@RhettBollinger Still #NotADinger #BooMauer
@Heisenbergkamp Or at least doesn’t *tell* people about it.
@RobHart1980 There’s still a Gulf between Tonkin and the rest of the Twins bullpen options.
@AndrewSimonMLB @SamMillerBP Big, if true. Do you think the Nats know?
@fangraphs Chris Sale is a *horrible* pitcher!
@injuryexpert Any sense of how much Parker’s foot injury is affecting his stock?
@SethTweets If so, she’s pretty dang good at it!
@ragnorokandroll Sounds like he’s headed to the land of burning rivers!
As expected, the Twins are hitting Chris Sale pretty solidly and are up 6-2. #WaitWhat?
Show me Trae Waynes!
@mattpuettmann They traded for Sam Bradford!
@BizballMaury 4) FSN North
@ragnorokandroll Wait, who is your intern?
According to Bert, the White Sox thought Sale was going to be the team’s next closer. Yeah…no.
@jlwoj “I can’t find ESPN, what channel is it on your system?”  “Oh, it’s just lying fallow this year until they get some new ideas"
@CompleteArse It’s like I always say: I wouldn’t eat my feelings if they weren’t so damn delicious
@RotoPat I still have parody accounts as #1 with a bullet.
@mike_petriello @mlb @statcast Oh hey, that’s awesome! Congratulations, Mike!!
@thian_un @Uchicago Everyone who didn’t write “drink heavily” is a liar.
@atrupar I haven’t used it myself, but everything I’ve heard about Medium has been really positive.
@AndyGlockner If Dallas’ mascot hadn’t been a living thing — if they had eliminated the Clippers — I wonder if this would have happened.
@SethTweets I think it’s indicates that he’s a wild card and every organization has their own. Twins thought Stauffer was the better bet.
@JeffPassan Seems harsh to call @AnswerDave filth for not liking Boxberger...
@cdgoldstein @andymoney69 I believe in this case it Señor Liker, tbh.
@andymoney69 Are you suggesting that Samardzija getting a win today is The Impossible Dream?
@ParkerHageman DFA Stauffer and call him up!
@EdgeofSports The game is on normal channels, but blacked out through MLBAM per usual. Everything’s normal, people wanted an exception made.
We can only hope. Come on, Chicago, I know you can do this! 
Joe Mauer is still a good baseball player #HotTake
YES. DO THIS! 
@michael_schlact The fans went all-out, too. What convincing costumes!
@jakenyberg @BusinessTake #TheGoodGuys
@Brandon_Warne I got “the moral flexibility” to swallow a football, which raises some interesting questions about me...
@JP_Breen *stands up*
My thinking has shifted: I hope the Browns draft Mariota, keep Manziel, trade for Tebow, then run a 3 QB set designed to hide the ball.
@Chicago2Chelsea Man, the Vikings dodged a bullet when the Browns took him instead of Bridgewater!
@zvsanders he deserves the chance to PROVE he’s a chump.
@zvsanders I’m unwilling to call half a season anything resembling enough time to make that judgement. I have no love for JDD, but still...
Yeah, this is probably fair.  
Wow, I find this hard to believe. Unless Manzeil, like, flunked out of rehab or something... 
@ManuclearBomb Or Gary. Gary works too.
@DSzymborski @ManuclearBomb @grogg I cannot imagine desktop twitter without Tweetdeck, tbh.
@CespedesBBQ Suddenly, I wish this were a Mariners/Orioles game and Jesus Montero was still catching for the M’s.
@ManuclearBomb @DSzymborski You probably follow some dead accounts. I’d look into who hasn’t tweeted in months and start paring them down
@DSzymborski @ManuclearBomb #Humblebrag
@jessespector #RIPJesse
@MikeGianella Joe Buck is MORTIFIED right now and has no idea why.
@AmeriGunner (kidding!)
@AmeriGunner Woof, sorry your classes have been so difficult!
@ChrisWarcraft It’s totally doable, but a bit of a haul. Take the Orange line into the loop, then you’ll probably transfer to the blue line
@hangingsliders @MJ_Baumann I will add the sugar and cherry on top to Wendy’s request.
@MikeIsaac thoughts are with u during this crisis.
@KFANRubeChat @ChrisLongKSTP A decent heavyweight could do it. Mayweather's fights aren’t as interesting to the casual fan since no KOs.
@KFANRubeChat @ChrisLongKSTP Until the next big one, sure.
@ChrisLongKSTP Man, it may not even be the most anticipated BOXING event in decades!
@Chris_Cwik With a cactus, man, fuck him with a cactus.
@MikeBatesSBN Holy crap, he’s still peddling that BS at age 50?! Shouldn’t he know better by now!?
@holly_holl Can’t I be both?
@holly_holl I was under the impression those just had an internal latch. You know…just in case.
@davidwiers @MattSnyderCBS @DSzymborski @zvsanders @cdgoldstein BREAKING: MATT SNYDER STARTS TWEETING, TWITTER LOSES 20% OF ITS VALUE
@hangingsliders @erikmal Do you guys still use Bamboo? I think I have my password around here somewhere...
@DSzymborski @davidwiers @zvsanders @MattSnyderCBS @cdgoldstein SOURCES: MATT SNYDER BEHIND STANZOLOL EPIDEMIC AND EBOLA OUTBREAK
@DSzymborski @zvsanders @MattSnyderCBS @davidwiers @cdgoldstein BREAKING: MATT SNYDER WANTS DH AT ALL POSITIONS IN ALL SPORTS.
@jh_moore I’m surprised they don’t just flip a series. I’m sure they have a three game set scheduled with the Rays in Tampa at some point.
@CespedesBBQ This may be the only time the Kiss Cam is funny and worth using.
@DCameronFG The Cubs for sure. Maybe the Astros?
@davidwiers @DSzymborski @zvsanders @cdgoldstein Poor @MattSnyderCBS is getting a ton of notifications he has not part in...
@davidwiers @DSzymborski @zvsanders @cdgoldstein @MattSnyderCBS All in jest though!
@DSzymborski @cdgoldstein @MattSnyderCBS Broadly speaking, yes. @zvsanders, @davidwiers, and I have our own royal rumble.
@zvsanders @DSzymborski Honestly, I toyed with whether that was too cruel. Decided it probably was. Then sent it anyway. I’m a monster.
@DSzymborski Just tell people you’re @zvsanders, then no one will know who you are!
@FutbolIntellect oh no question. That wasn’t meant to replace yours, it was an addendum.
@FutbolIntellect “This may seem like a good idea, but we *guarantee* it subtly damaged their relationship. Don’t do this."
I’m not positive here, but I believe @APkrawczynski is employing some sarcasm here... 
@Stefmara @SINow Hooray! Happy anniversary!
(3/2) That’s not a condemnation of Obama by any means, he’s in an untenable position no matter what he says, but that’s how it’s going to go
Both sides freak out about a statement that pretty much says nothing. By 6pm no one cares anymore and we see footage of the CVS again. (2/2)
Before Obama even speaks, let me just clue you in to the next couple hours: He calls for calm while mentioning underlying issues… (1/2)
@HunterFelt It was prescient of our forefathers to specifically forbid that in the Geneva conventions. What visionaries they were!
@Bill_TPA Oh definitely. I tend to think the handwringing over property damage is overwrought, but that aspect gave me pause.
@Bill_TPA The one point I did think was interesting re: CVS is that b/c it’s a pharmacy, local residents could be high and dry for a while
@jessespector @kenarneson Not too hot, not too cold, just right.
@jonbernhardt If that’s accurate — I wouldn’t know him from Adam — that makes the post itself deeply ironic.
@AaronGleeman It’s already gone. Wonder if anyone got a mirror of it...
@eveewing @Cassie_Ashantae I want so badly for there to be a place people can go to, to get good news coverage, but all they do is watch CNN
@eveewing @Cassie_Ashantae You know the saying "Inside every cynical person, there is a disappointed idealist.”? That’s me and CNN.
@eveewing As horrifying as it is, it’s still better than CNN.
Horror-watching “Sex Sent Me To The Slammer” and I can’t help but feel like somehow @cdgoldstein and @holly_holl are to blame for this
@panndder wonder if we’ll see more #HotTakes about Baltimore because of TheWire. Lotta people pretending they know something about the area
@ManuclearBomb Probably my favorite take on the day: 
@arsenaloFka Oh man, that’s coming up soon isn’t it? I’m so excited!
@WattsMR Why the sam hell are the Bears retweeting that!?
@dcwoodruff Probably appropriate. Still, the Show-me-no-black-people State is a pretty good zinger.
@Tepper I don’t know what’s sadder: The negative WAR or the fact that four teams were still worse!
@holly_holl Plus, you’d be so mad, we could just set them near you and they’d burst into flame.
@holly_holl Home Run. I will personally bring many, many tires to the fire.
@JamieMottram That highlighted section sounds like a copy-and-paste from an AOL flak. I can’t even hear those words in Jeter’s voice.
The Vanderbilts never died, they just moved into pharmaceuticals. 
@petebasgen THANKS OBAMA
@FutbolIntellect NY Octopus would have been a great name for NYCFC. Is it too late for them to change?
Far too many “Killer Growth Tips!” basically boil down to “Get someone famous to talk about your product!” Not. That. Helpful. #Marketing
@TheTomasRios I thought you had a good shot, but credit where credit is due: Pravda’s been at the game a LONG time. #GOAT
@Brandon_Warne @sabometrics @MikeBatesSBN @Bill_TPA Goalies taking penalty kicks or kickers tackling, probably.
@sabometrics @MikeBatesSBN @Brandon_Warne @Bill_TPA Chein-Ming Wang should be patient zero for that line of argument.
@sabometrics @MikeBatesSBN @Brandon_Warne @Bill_TPA I just don’t see Waino’s injury as being hitting-specific. His Achilles’ was a timebomb
@sabometrics @Bill_TPA @Brandon_Warne Viva Jack Cust!
@Bill_TPA @Brandon_Warne In fact, we’ll probably praise it and come up with a hashtag for it!
@BMcCarthy32 or Canada with Curling!
I don’t see how anyone who watches wrestling can make fun of people for watching esports. To each their own, yeah?
@bennyc50 Heroes of the Storm. If you like it, League of Legends is similar, but with waaaaaay clearer streams you can watch.
@TomFornelli Only occasionally. Dragons are a sometimes food.
@ChrisWarcraft I do like the relative lack of jargon. I still don’t have a clue what a jungler is!
@StateStSports MLG is SUCH a cool space for advertisers right now. High stakes, small margin of error, but what an opportunity!
@MikeGianella I’ve been beating the drum for his nickname to be “Landed” for YEARS, but it has never stuck. Heartbreaking, really.
@larsleafblad I’d rather ask that than “So, Coach, do you think failing to pull Allen is going to cost you your job?” It probably should!
@mattpuettmann Pretty much all your weekend needs is ol’ Stan officially announcing the Rams move to LA.
Got the result, but whiffed on the OT prediction. No word on @mattpuettmann’s liver.  
Game. Series. Over. #GoHomeBlues
@dturkenk @cdgoldstein Right up there with Firefly as shows that were canceled criminally early. Criminal!
Have a day, Parise!
@holly_holl Wild fans tend to also be Twins fans. Just let us have this, we’ll pay our penance from July to October.
LOL Elliot is coming in about 35 seconds after Hitchcock said there was no chance he’d make a change.
@rui_xu damn man, teach me your ways!
Phenomenal solo goal by Parise. Shrugs off the check then makes Allen look terrible by beating him near post. #Goalazo #mnwild
SHORTY!!!!!!!!!
@toasterposey @dianagram Had the same thought. There was nothing in his movements, which probably means the tear was just waiting to happen
LOL United
The newest addition to our gaming space. Cat for scale. #Cordaroy #Catstagram 
@jlwoj Yeah, for sure. 20 hrs, right?
@LaVelleNeal It’s ballpark karma for last night’s speedfest
@jlwoj Dang, I am…nowhere near LAX. Think they’ll hold the flight for me anyway?
@TomFornelli Give in to your hate, not your fear. #BooStLouis
LRT: look at Davis shaking his head at the very end of that Vine. Can't really blame him, what else is he supposed to do?

The Twins are not very good. This is a scheduled tweet.
@AmeriGunner IS YOUR DAD PART OF THE PAYPAL MAFIA?!
@NotMrTibbs The number is for Oswego PC Repair. So random!
Did Elon Musk get hacked? Why is he tweeting an IL phone number?
@JP_Breen I have no idea, but I'd pay GOOD MONEY to see him try.
@CompleteArse I haven’t looked up the video, but it’s allegedly his dog doing something of a sexual nature with his girlfriend.
@CompleteArse Almost certainly not. Whether it’s his partner or not, it’s still kinda unsettling.
@KarleeKanz Coyle’s goal was SUCH a relief. Even with a two goal lead, that period was super intense before he put it away.
@AmeriGunner #TeamPicard #MakeItSo
@AmeriGunner I just may!
If this score holds, St. Paul is going to be absolutely electric on Sunday. #BecauseItsTheCup #MNWild
GET IN!!!!!!!!!!! GO WILD!
@mattpuettmann No worse than other players of his kind: Technically worthless and a part of the game that will be gone in 10 years.
@CespedesBBQ Spontaneous open water spots
@holly_holl @Chris_Cwik LE GRILL?! WHAT THE HELL IS THAT??
@RotoPat ProTip: Don’t search that hashtag in public
@bennyc50 I was closer before I moved to West Saint Paul! You’re not far from my folks
@MikeBerardino If Plouffe hadn’t broken up the no-hitter already, no chance they change that. #HomeCooking
Goes without saying, but it’s massively important for the #mnwild to get to the intermission without conceding. Don’t give the Blues hope.
HUGE!!!! LET’S GO WILD!!
Man, HUGE goal for Nino there. Come on, #mnwild!
@cdgoldstein Most of the time I’d say you were full of it, but that’s entirely logical. I choose to believe you.
@zvsanders I toyed with predicting that, thought I’d go for the sure thing
@zvsanders It’s not going to matter, Felix is throwing at no-no tonight.
Only one ball has left the park, but man, the M’s are making really, really solid contact against Phil Hughes. Not a good sign for him.
@zvsanders Must just be a bad memory on my part.
@zvsanders Did Felix lose weight coming into this season? I feel like he was more filled out previously.
@Brandon_Warne Like Jon Lester and a successful pickoff move, I was due for one eventually.
I believe that’s going to be scored an error. Hit him right in the glove… #MNWild
@Bill_TPA Didn’t Torii also say he never wanted to play in MN again or something to that effect?
@dschoenfield Maybe, but I’d for sure sell a kidney for the Twins to get a pitcher anywhere near as good as Yordano Ventura.
@Bill_TPA I’m guessing it’s a bit like why I hate Hunter coming back to MN: Unnecessary, expensive, and he said some dumb stuff.
@holly_holl Even when Ron Washington quit for silly reasons?
Guess who just found out about Josh Hamilton hint it’s @holly_holl
@CespedesBBQ #RIPLanasStuff
Wow, per @Sullivan_Ranger it IS the Rangers that are trading for Hamilton. Did not see that one coming at all! (Sorry, @Lana)
@dustinparkes I’m just going to continue laughing at the Angels no matter what, does that count?
@Tepper Llewellyn Sinclair
@dturkenk Everybody loves cash and/or bourbon.
@cdgoldstein look, we already know the Mets have very strong opinions on marriage: 
@IDPSharks I guess so! Bold to advertise it online too
Man, the rates have gone way down since I got out of the game... 
@zvsanders @Chris_Cwik 
@zvsanders @Chris_Cwik It’s a solid macro, but that’s like the third time I’ve seen you use it, Sanders. What, out of new material?
@drewsilv “Wow, how’d you get that huge trophy?!” “I got the last word in an internet pissing contest. Proudest day of my life!"
I'd love to know if anyone has tried @CrystalKnowsMe on me. I doubt it, but interesting idea for sure #CrystalKnows: 
@DSzymborski So it’s really just a question of loss of function and his pain tolerance.
@DSzymborski Given his injury, playing on it doesn’t substantially change the potential time lost and he won’t get healthy w/o surgery.
@MikeBatesSBN Grandpa Simpson was right: 
Hockey noob Q: If Matt Cooke and Steve Ott run into each other, does the world just end in a spontaneous explosion of violence and hate?
@JP_Breen Also: Survivor effect: If you’re playing in the NFL, you didn’t die before age 18 and probably won’t before age 30.
I’m pretty ambivalent about Pete Rose, but if there’s no way in heaven or hell he should get into the Hall of Fame before Shoeless Joe does.
@enosarris Johan Santa!
@lukebcarman Next year’s Sox motto: Stay Gold
@DSzymborski That NL Central is AMAZING. 4 90-win teams and the 100-loss Brewers!
@panndder Nah, there’s no way that many Americans know that pardoning criminals is something the president can do.
LRT: That’s insane. The fight itself was bad enough, but for Sale to seek out Ventura is NUTS.
@FSNtylermason @Brandon_Warne Correct.
@nnelson9 Got to assume he’ll be heading to Ft. Meyers soon, yeah?
Not watching, what'd Jonny Flynn do?
@Snoz22 @jakenyberg @bennyc50 For whatever reason, I have a really hard time getting charcoal to the right temperature and to stay there
@emmaspan Much like @JeppsonsMalort, Hawk is a trick Chicagoans play on the rest of the nation. There’s no such thing as tolerance.
@bennyc50 @jakenyberg You go with a separate grill and smoker then?
@jakenyberg @bennyc50 Have either of you gents ever used a Traeger grill? Thinking of picking one up, but reading mixed reviews.
@MN_Matt3 @jakenyberg @Drizly It’s true. NYC/CHI are the ideals, but the spread out nature of MSP + the cold makes this a solid market
@jakenyberg @Drizly Which makes no sense, outside of higher density cities like NYC/Chicago, this might be the best possible area for them
@jakenyberg @Drizly I’m surprised by how behind MSP is with delivery. GrubHub is pretty poor here and few delivery startups come here.
@jessespector From the mouth of babes and all that...
@cdgoldstein Don’t tell me what to do
@zvsanders @Chris_Cwik Yeah, that seems like good advice, racist.
@nnelson9 Madden once said that was the thing that surprised him most about being on both sides: How much they tried to look like the other
@rebeccapbp You gotta see the signs that tell you when you’re beat, and the NL East is well and truly beat now.
@suss2hyphens To be fair, no one could have predicted just how funny they would be. I thought it’d be good, but they’re just killing it!
@TomFornelli Quick, shovel more prospects on the fire!
@WattsMR Glen Perkins for Starlin Castro WHO SAYS NO?!?!?!?
@shipleykid "I'm not casting any aspersions on North Minneapolis. OK?”  Like hell he isn’t! How dumb does he think voters are?
Glory be, we have internet again!
@Sedna_51 Bourbon?
Man, I had no idea so many hops were proprietary strains. Everything I want to grow is still under patent!
There was a panda hocking parking for the #MNWild game at the Salvation Army on #West7th. $10, too,… 
@chadyoung @davidwiers Depends where their highest margins/expected returns are, I suppose. Hardware is super high margin though...
@chadyoung @davidwiers Worth considering here: There have to be Anti-trust implications for a company that owns the hardware AND network.
@chadyoung @davidwiers And I suspect that’s what we’d see here: Google killing it with their own hardware, then supporting iOS much later.
@chadyoung @davidwiers At least at first. With things like iTunes and Safari, we do see Apple broadening its base when it needs to.
@zvsanders @Brandon_Warne And someone accidentally tags Grandmaster Flash 
@Bbl_Astrophyscs Perhaps not, but you *can* avenge the victims. #AvengeThem!
@ManuclearBomb WHAT’D YOU DO, RICHARD?!
@ManuclearBomb It seems like that’s immaterial to whether or not you get thrown in jail these days.
@ManuclearBomb I really wonder what I might have gotten arrested for if I weren’t a relatively affluent white male. I wasn’t a hellion, but
@ManuclearBomb Ugh, that’s too sickeningly true to favorite.
@davidwiers Will be really, really, really interesting to see if they ever support iOS devices.
@rbosj @TwinsGeek @EastlakeMGM They also have my all time favorite beer name: The Increasingly Lost Saison.
@texaszeller @dbrauer And way more kicked in by MNUFC than the Saints, though 11m is probably a pretty sizable contribution for them.
@dbrauer @texaszeller Tie them all in together the way Philly did on the outskirts of the city.
@dbrauer @texaszeller Ok, that makes more sense now. Still, seems like they could get extra bang out of that cleanup money with United park
@dbrauer @texaszeller I must have missed the CHS controversy. That seems to be what I can’t reconcile
@dbrauer @texaszeller But with two other new stadia in the last 10 years, they had to know MLPS was a huge risk, right?
Is there a reason @MNUnitedFC is deadset on land in Minneapolis? Seems like St. Paul might be an easier sell. @dbrauer, any insight here?
@ironmikegallego As true now as it ever was. (I assume. I guess I don’t really know that for sure.)
Every time you autocorrect "Do you have a sec?" to "Do you have a sex?" you put my entire career at risk.
If you have information on a footer but an infinite scroll, I hate you. If a “useful” popup obscures what I’m trying to read, doubly so.
@oilcanboyz @injuryexpert NP! I’m trying to avoid the surgery myself right now, so I’ve done a lot of research into it. Interesting stuff.
@injuryexpert @oilcanboyz FAI is almost always related to bone development/ joint space rather than position. He’s no better anywhere else.
@injuryexpert Not positive, but if I had to guess, a catcher would have better local musculature than an OF or IF. Bodes well for the Reds.
@injuryexpert For normal folks, full recovery is 4-6 months. A lot depends on the surrounding musculature.
@holly_holl I want to do a second coat tomorrow to see how that changes things. Also, The Wife is voting right swatch, so that's a thing...
@cdgoldstein @holly_holl those are transdimensional portals and they're heirlooms, thank you very much.
@holly_holl it's grey with yellowish accents
@holly_holl Hi Holly, our furniture is light wood, the window trim is dark brown and this is our bedding: 
Picking bedroom colors is tough! #Orange #RedOrange #AllKillerNoFilter 
@JohnSharkman That’s, like, twice as many ducks as Bryan Price dropped on the Reds media!
@jlwoj @cdgoldstein To get water?
@Baer_Bill @craigcalcaterra Hands where we can see ‘em, Baer
@ManuclearBomb Should probably eliminate next of kin as well, just in case.
@SethTweets @RhettBollinger @kbrobaseball No, see, that’s batting DOWN. The 10th is what makes it go *around* to the top!
@SethTweets @RhettBollinger Nope, somebody has to bat twice. Or, as @kbrobaseball put it, it has to ruin your scorebook.
@SethTweets @RhettBollinger Is it the 9th man or the 10th that constitutes batting around. #Team10thMan
Man, just when I had started to like him. 
@MikeBatesSBN @holly_holl I just assumed it ran on the blood of the innocent.
@MikeBatesSBN Don’t forget the pure joy that is Jose Fernandez!
Since I just added this (
If Mike Redmond is on the hot seat the way it sounds like he might be (see @craigcalcaterra’s last tweets) I wonder if MIA will call Gardy.
@ajwalsh08 TBF most of that is just from me.
@DSzymborski That’s the weirdest spelling of “Kraft” I’ve ever seen.
Absolutely outstanding response from @ctrent here: 
@DWolfsonKSTP There may come a day when I can look at Tellem’s name and not think his nickname should be SouljaBoy, but it is not this day!
@Marc_Normandin @Bill_TPA Yeah, but getting the 1991 Twins back together could be really challenging...
@zvsanders I could say the same about you. Should we be worried about you too, worrywart?
@erikmal @Lahlahlindsey It’s Philip Rivers and Lawrence Philips doing Abbot and Costello routines via prison telephone simulcast.
I know this 
This apology is almost as bad as the tirade itself. #SorryNotSorry RT @bomani_jones: #77times 
@ddocket Aw man, I wondered where I’d left that bag...
@Sedna_51 Hooray!!
@ManuclearBomb he's a main figure in ggate if that clues you in at all.
@eveewing ban voicemail first
Getting a bunch of stuff delivered to the house today. At least one guy is definitely working on what he considers a holiday.
@jakenyberg Wow, so that Fulham place was sold in 2013 and now they want almost 100k more for it? I wonder what they added to it.
@jakenyberg I had no idea. Now that we’re settled in St. Paul, I’m making a point of getting to know the city way better than I do now.
@jakenyberg I’m surprised by the location, too. I mean, Falcon Heights isn’t exactly known for it’s daring architectural choices...
@jakenyberg Dang! That place is AWESOME
@Mobute Cantaloupe for life #RideOrDie
@panndder It’s worse elsewhere, believe me. If you’re pouring one out, pour it out for St. Louis!
First night in the new house means new noises to get used to. It's all nothing, but with all the adrenaline in my system, I'm still jumpy
@jay_jaffe Hooray! Congrats to you and @emmaspan!
@Boulevard_Beer I just grabbed without checking, but I'll keep an eye out next time!
@boulevard_beer just FYI the Dierbergs in O'Fallon is selling some of your beer past-date 
I don't know who had the more stressful morning: Me driving a 30ft truck through Iowa or the #Arsenal fans that actually watched the match!
@SixToolPlayer I mean, I did get him for $21 in a friends and family auction
@CompleteArse Halftime sub, but his work rate is incredible and he scores in the 73rd.
@Sanders9 do you have a brother named Tony? If so, is he a mover? If so, he is definitely in my apartment right meow!
@Brandon_Warne If you need any help, lmk. We closed on ours earlier this week in MSP, so have plenty of recommendations.
My home for the next two days. Not excited about this...

@harrypav @JessicaFastball @ManuclearBomb He thought I was dead in the basement of the IKEA in Bollingbrook because my phone had cut out
@JessicaFastball @harrypav @ManuclearBomb true story: My dad once tried to explain to my wife how to do a tracheotomy with a knife &amp; pen
@harrypav @JessicaFastball @ManuclearBomb The crazy straw adds a nice touch of whimsy, I think he'll enjoy that. Great idea!
@JessicaFastball @harrypav @ManuclearBomb Wow, that's generous! Maybe I should finally give mine some time off to get that stent he "needs"
@harrypav @ManuclearBomb Wait, that Jeb quote isn't a joke? I...just wow.
@sporer LOVE Waino’s random dances! This was my favorite: 
@whatahowler 1) Juan Agudelo is still around. 2) The Alamodome is a terrible place for a game 3) #DosaCero isn’t getting old any time soon.

@MikeGianella nice
@AaronGleeman @dbrauer It’s sad to think I’ve been beating the “Mauer should be batting second” drum for almost a full decade now.
@nnelson9 Wow, it’s almost like his complete lack of a repeatable delivery is going to be an issue at upper levels...
Pretty bummed that the Heat missed the playoffs, you guys. It’s going to make things much less entertaining this year.
@sporer @zvsanders Meowth, that’s right!
@CompleteArse Thanks! We’re pretty excited
@CompleteArse I closed on my first house yesterday!
@chrisgarosi @5GrootsPie @brooksbaseball Wait, this could be a trick… #LandShark!
@Swydan @BeerGraphs No chance on Shock Top, but Goose technically still does, even if it is now owned by A-B
@TwinkieTown If you were to list the Twins’ problems, he wouldn’t make the first page.
@jlwoj That counts as a moral failing on your part
@FutbolIntellect If you want to try a free version to see how you like it without losing money try 
@FutbolIntellect Just don’t do it for the first month or so of the season. Once results stabilize, it’s pretty doable.
@jlwoj knowing horses, he probably defiled something of mine on the way in. He’s not excused.
@harrypav @keithlaw I used to block everyone who called me the N-word, but it got to be too many, so I stopped. Thankfully, that’s died down
@panndder It’s psychological: The team is going to win so few games, having one blown at the last moment feels even worse.

@mattpuettmann I would like to preemptively apologize for Cooke blinding someone, probably Oshe. No point in pretending it won’t happen...
@mattpuettmann It’s just over two miles from my new house to the Xcel. When we hoist the cup, I should be able to hear it from my porch

@MikeGianella @faketeams Right, but fantasy is fine, which means DFS is fine since it’s fantasy. Gambling can still be demonized.
@faketeams @MikeGianella @jaysonst Would still ban any player/ref/owner/anyone else who got caught betting on games
@faketeams @MikeGianella @jaysonst Not really. They do the same soft stuff, and Silver has said it is inevitable, but both leagues...
@faketeams @MikeGianella @jaysonst I would say so — and that’s totally fine by me — but it’s an issue for MLB to support gambling
@MikeGianella @jaysonst @darrenrovell It’s MLB’s problem since they’ve already named an official partner in the space. Not a great look.
@injuryexpert Ah yes, forgot the literal “more money than [he or she] knows what to do with"
@MikeGianella @jaysonst @darrenrovell Agree, but isn’t that a tacit admission that DFS is pretty much gambling?
@injuryexpert I’m guessing not many. Laptops may not be disposable, but no one is planning on having the same one for 10-15 years

@Sky_Kalkman Your ideas intrigues me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter. What are you proposing exactly?
@Sky_Kalkman Because I agree, add/drop is liquid, trades are almost always rent-seeking.
@Sky_Kalkman I think anyone who has played fantasy before is at least a little scared of getting burned in a deal and getting mocked for it.
@bennyc50 Let’s be honest: There’s no way that’s the first hooker Bert’s killed. The shock is that he was careless enough to get caught!
@Tepper pfft, told you
@Tepper you got nothing on me
@CarlosGil83 Going with Meerkat over Periscope, eh?
@Kazuto_Yamazaki so you're *not* stranded in Manilla?
@ScottyD__ Also, today marks, I believe, the 25th day in a row “Call Scotts Office for Apt.” has been on my to-do list.
@ScottyD__ “This bad” for a full season would be historically bad, and I don’t think they’re quite historically bad. They’ll get better.
The line on the Twins game was 9. I took the under, thinking “gee, it’s unlikely the Twins are going to get beat so badly again” #Moron
@PhilMackey Actually, same season, the Twins lost to DET 9-0, 18-1, and 6-0 in very late April. What a strange season that was!
@PhilMackey In 2006, the Twins had a series with Texas where all three games were decided by 8 runs or more, but at least MIN won 1 of the 3
@Lana I’m pretty sure @jonahkeri jinxing the team is the only thing that can save them now.
I do not envy @TwinsPrez for having to appear at tomorrow’s #StribHQ event.
@Kazuto_Yamazaki Not really. This team was never going to do anything remotely relevant this season. This is just too early to be this bad
@Kazuto_Yamazaki I want to do whatever the opposite of favorite is. Mourn? I’m mourning this tweet.

@ManuclearBomb I mean, if you’ll sign an affidavit that you asked me to, I can get my hands on a nice sword and I’ll be in CHI in May...
Do they even have Senior Day at Kentucky any more?
@Sedna_51 @edsbs @cjane87 For ‘Bama fans? Necessary and desirable.
@KarleeKanz What, no “All of the Above” option?
@ATallOrder Well, the sun may nova by then, but if not I’ll still be here. Enjoy the conference!
@zvsanders @enosarris Just sound it out, Zach, you’ll get the words eventually! #SlowAndSteady
@sean_ahmed Strangely, I never did the athletics piece, but I’m still attached to the school. Heading back down in May for #Scav2015
@sean_ahmed Congrats on the alumni award!
@jessespector They did well the last time they moved to Minnesota, and it’s not like there’s a professional team there now...
@dcwoodruff Man, Replacement-level White Guy may be one of the greatest insults of all time. Reminds me of: 
@dcwoodruff But that one guy is wearing *TENNIS SHOES* How could he not be hip and cool and with it and down with the youths of today???
@ATallOrder How long are you in town?
Wow. I definitely missed both the illuminati AND Obama subplots in Frozen


@RotoPat Anyone vs. the Twins is going to be a safe bet for the foreseeable, I think
Awesome event tonight at the @weismanart. Really thought provoking questions about public and private spaces. Thanks @UChicagoAlumni!
@panndder Homestyle Boneless Pork, Chicken Tenders, Fried Chicken &amp; Gravy, Battered Fish Filet, and Sesame Chicken. Not exactly health food
@panndder Take it from an old hand, in terms of food per meal: Marie Calendar’s, Lean Cuisine, Healthy Choice, RabbleRabbleRabble
@MikeGianella Always an excellent choice. Always.
@drewsilv @djshort Weird to think that’s how Terry Ryan — now much lampooned — was regarded back in the early 2000s.
@WillGordonAgain Have you ever used @BeerGraphs for rating?
@zvsanders Their current strategy of not really needing one seems solid through two games though.
@VeeckAsInWreck No, but if you puke in the cab, they charge you $500 AND the driver gets one free punch on you.
@AnswerDave No on the first one (no porn allowed on Vine) and no on the second one (no snuff films either)
@dianagram What’s the most runs scored in a single game without recording an official AB? Avila has 3 on 3 walks so far!
a pretty good indicator of where the confidence level of the fans is at. It’s going to be a long season.(2/2)
There is no point burying the Twins after two games, no matter how bad they look. That said, the general willingness to do so is (1/2)
@darth I can’t see any of those in the desktop tweetdeck for OS X 10.10.2
@jlwoj I completely understand why, but the quotes he gives are Peak Lawyer.
Apropos of nothing… #MNTwins RT @dianagram: Worst run differential after two games, since 1900, is -22, by 1951 St. Louis Browns #MLB
@afansview They ought to just leave KG in after his first pitch. Can’t be that much worse...
@mattlindner Someone will still pee in a cup.
@teen_archer Make me.
@McCannSportsLaw Couldn’t age work against him since incarceration will cost the state more? Cynical, I know, but worth pondering.
@ATallOrder Young Bruce Jenner or recent Bruce Jenner?
@ATallOrder As long as you keep Emily Dickinson and Bruce Dickinson straight, everything else is just details
@rebeccapbp I was really surprised it took them as long as it did to deliberate.
Even Brett Lawrie thinks they should take a pitch or two
Twins really made Anibal Sanchez work in the first inning. Six pitches!
@suss2hyphens Cannot believe Chris Shelton isn’t on there. SMDH
@wezen_ball Sorry, Ballpark Village, they whole redone complex next to the park
@MikeBerardino Kind of surprising that Steubs is doing the surgery, no? They had been outsourcing everything to Altchek recently.
@wezen_ball It’s also a Faustian bargain. BPV is nice, but it’s killing other areas of downtown that had grown up more organically.
@Matt_HBB @jlwoj @cdgoldstein It’s a damn plague!
@jlwoj @cdgoldstein 
@jlwoj @cdgoldstein I will yell about this, too, if you will yell at MLB with me about using “impactful” #NOTAWORD
@AndrewSimonMLB When did impactful become an acceptable word, and who can I complain to about it? #GetOffMyLawn
@ajwalsh08 Wait, is a nacho cheese fountain a real thing, cause...
@ajwalsh08 OTOH: The Twins gave up Carlos Gomez for JJ Hardy, then gave up Hardy for salary relief and JIM FREAKIN’ HOEY.
@ajwalsh08 The fact that you have a long-term 3B and corner OFs has to soften the blow a bit, no? I mean, bad deal, but hardly fatal.
@mathewi Congratualtions, Matthew! What a coup for @FortuneMagazine
@alexremington Terrible, but some might say I’m hardly fit for public consumption anyway, so…
@BLarsenAFC1886 Ehhhhhhhh….ManU and Liverpool fans aren’t far behind.
@dturkenk I’m curious what a low-friction tattoo would be like, actually
@cdgoldstein What do you think I do for a living…wait, DO NOT ANSWER THAT
We’re getting to the point in my career where I’ve said “It’s too high-friction” so many times, I should just get a tattoo of it on my face.
@MikeGianella If the Joe Kelly trade hadn’t been such a shock to everyone, I bet he would have. Missed Opportunity, IMO
@FutbolIntellect Cristiano Ronaldo started it! 
@MATrueblood @sporer Oh definitely. If the Twins get even 2 good innings out of Santana today, I’d bet the farm they’ll win easily!
@sporer And a guaranteed win for your Tigers to boot!
@Arsenal Szczney and Giroud!
@Brandon_Warne Man, I choreographed a ton of prom invitations in my day. Not having her ready is AMATEUR HOUR!
@panndder As a lifelong midwesterner, you know I do!
@panndder Don’t do this to me. I brought my lunch today and it definitely isn’t that.
This Marlins broadcast is BRUTAL, holy cow.
The Kitten is enjoying #nationalbeerday as much as I am. bellsbrewery #catsofinstagram 
@mattlindner It’s not as upsetting to me as the one in St. Louis really shortly after Michael Brown was killed, but it’s pretty disturbing
@FutbolIntellect Hate all you want, but those shoes are fly
@mattlindner 
The NYT video is sickening, but HUGE credit to the kid who filmed it. Could have run away, but stayed and captured important scene.
@jakenyberg Can I take the name in A and the tagline in B?
@cdgoldstein Potato Potato
@panndder Just got lucky and had a friend that wanted to hit those places and was willing to pay. Let me think of some other gems...
@panndder The Girl and The Goat and Allinea, both in Chicago
@cdgoldstein they made you a shirt! RT @darth: for that special someone in your twitter mentions

@thecultureofme 
@MikeBatesSBN @Brando_Warne @Chris_Cwik @craigcalcaterra If this is the <FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE> life, count me out. I’ll keep my takes chilly like gazpacho.
@alexremington @Chris_Cwik @Brandon_Warne @MikeBatesSBN <FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE>
@Brandon_Warne @cdgoldstein It still could be once Santana comes back around the all-star break. I’ll be interested to see how he adapts.
@cdgoldstein @Brandon_Warne What should make you sad inside is the fact that Mike Pelfry’s going to get at least 10 starts this year.
@Chris_Cwik @Brandon_Warne I hate to say it, but @MikeBatesSBN is right. At sufficient volume, all takes become hot takes.
@Chris_Cwik @Brandon_Warne If he wants me, he knows where to find me.
@Brandon_Warne Here’s a hot take: Trevor May makes at least 15 starts
@Brandon_Warne Man, that take’s so cold, the waitress just asked if you need it thrown under the heatlamps for a sec.
@darth 93 Twitter to 7 FB. Tweetdeck just makes it too easy to stay on Twitter all day, but I have to actually go to Facebook.
@tsbarnhill @AndyGlockner I like Ospina, but plenty of people agree with you. Still, this beats last summer when they needed…to get better
@AndyGlockner And there’s no way City sit on their hands this summer. It’ll be an interesting battle for sure.
@AndyGlockner I don’t disagree, but now that Arsenal is playing like they should, buying the 1-2 pieces they need should be easier come June
@AndyGlockner And it’s well considered indeed. If nothing else, it makes me really hopeful for a decent title race next season.
@AndyGlockner @SInow Short of a Hazard-Cesc-Costa murder-suicide pact, I think this one is pretty well sewn up.
Wow, between the shambolic state of the bleachers and the return of Kris Bryant, the Cubs really do have perverse incentives to cancel games
@BLarsenAFC1886 @Arsenal The one sarcastically blaming Ozil is spot on, tho
@ajwalsh08 But, as I own Russell in Dynasty, I am all about this move. Make it happen, Theo!
@ajwalsh08 Got to wonder what the Pads have left that the Cubs are interested in.
@benpopper @plante One can make the argument, too, that Periscope/Meerkat are as close as we’ve ever gotten to Orwell’s telescreens.
@BLarsenAFC1886 @Gunnersaurus I always figured it was one of the youth scouts looking for the next crop of academy players on the sly.
@clairbearattack Children don’t need to learn about the French and Indian War, they need to learn about ZLATAN!
@teen_archer @daynperry Best explanation I’ve heard is that they need to admit virtually no wrongdoing ahead of future lawsuits.
@jessespector You mean Kyle Kendrick isn’t the Cy Young favorite? Damn, wonder if Vegas refunds bets...
Great news for Target Field guests with @hotindianfoods opening a cart in the stadium! If you haven’t had an Indurito yet, get on it ASAP.
@kbrobaseball Hungry for a cupcake is my permanent state of being.
@kbrobaseball I am 100% convinced that was intentional. They got far more shares than they would have if that had said “home run"
@panndder I can be pretty pedantic at times, but wow, that is some next-level pedantry!
@anildash Mom
Better dead than red though.
In all seriousness, commensurations to my Badger fan followers. Great season, and a tough loss at the end.
@injuryexpert There was one in the top of the 8th in the Baltimore/TB game.
@davidwiers @zvsanders @Swydan @AugustF_MLB Yeah, you’re all freaks fo sho.
@rotobuzzguy Look at it this way: It’s one of the best ways to go...
@Chris_Cwik THE TWINS ARE GOING TO GO 0-162 AND KYLE KENDRICK IS A LEGIT ACE #LEGITACE
@RandBall #VeteranLeadership
@RobHart1980 Hawk doesn’t need anyone to tell him about Yaz, man, he was THERE. “Siri, let me tell you about Yaz…"
@MikeGianella Well, good to know I'm not alone I guess... #ColdComfort
@KarleeKanz Torii HBP and a Vargas game-tying GS is just what the Dr. ordered.
@Kazuto_Yamazaki @dturkenk well, good to know the Twins won’t be the first to suffer the second worst conceivable start to a season...
Not sure if this is one for @cantpredictball or @dianagram: Has anyone ever been no-hit on Opening Day?
@CespedesBBQ #SwagSwagSwagSwagSwag
And the first homer of the #MLB season goes to…JD Martinez, as we all expected. @cantpredictball
@aprihoda You know Lent just *ended* right?
@PeterSchoenke And how quickly they adapt. I’m high as a kite on Sano long-term, but who knows if he’ll be able to hit this year.
@MikeBatesSBN @MJ_Baumann @Bill_TPA Still better than Jack Morris...
@PeterSchoenke Pounding it. This team is 1-2 injuries away from the #1 overall pick now that Santana is going to miss half the season.
Whoops, messed up my Twins prediction this morning: 71-91, not 70-90.
@BaseballATeam I took Lind as well. The one who worries me is Segura, who I grabbed to save money, but could easily backfire badly.
@BaseballATeam I went all in against the Rockies. That’s my strategy: hope bad things happen to Kyle Kendrick #ItUsusallyWorks
@sporer @Brandon_Warne @PeterSchoenke I figured there was a relation, just surprised I hadn’t heard of him before. Any good?
@Brandon_Warne @PeterSchoenke Definitely wasn’t placed on the DL. Side Note: The Tigers have an OF named Ben Verlander?
@Swydan @bubbaprog If you’re tweeting it b/c it’s funny, go for it. If you’re tweeting it b/c you think they screwed up, you’ve been played
@WarJessEagle I strongly believe that was intentional. They’re getting more buzz off the mistake than they would have if it were right.
@StateStSports Before/After the bottom of the 4th inning before someone tips one over with someone else inside it?
@Marc_Normandin It’s definitely annoying. I’m looking forward to getting my PS3 back next weekend when I move. Too much Destiny w/o it...
@Marc_Normandin Since it’s a USB charger, you can run it off your laptop and still use it that way. That’s what I did when mine died anyway.
@JP_Breen no.
@PhilMackey Better dead than red #GoDuke
@klnfamilybrands 3-1 Tigers  #OpeningDay #FreeSnacks
@CespedesBBQ I’ll always be partial to Punto, but today feels like a Yuni Betancourt day.
@ATallOrder I’m picturing myself with a bucket of water, a pussy willow, and a look of ABJECT TERROR on my face as a small Polish boy.
@LeanderAlphabet @howardmegdal @jareddiamond Planning to build through free agency the way the Angels did a few years ago.
Seconded! RT @mikeaxisa: I hereby request one (1) A-Rod dinger today.
#MNTwins predictions: 70-90, Joe Mauer hits above .300, May is in the rotation before June 1, Sano debuts this year, Buxton does not.
@BLarsenAFC1886 Just reminds the scum time and time again what color North London is. #NorthLondonIsRed
@cardcrazy850 I like Martin, but yeah, 5th seems a little too rich for my blood.
@MikeFerrinSXM @PWSullivan Up and At Them!
@rotobuzzguy Maybe I’m behind the times, but I didn’t think Quentin was that bad. Got to believe an AL team picks him up to DH
@dianagram no (Camel) Joe Benson (&amp; Hedges)?
@Bbl_Astrophyscs Who needs windows anyway, right? (Glad you guys aren’t there!)
@zvsanders this ought to illustrate the general feeling between the two states: 
@zvsanders I will kill you where you stand, you wretch.
@zvsanders ? Did you forget I’m from Gopher territory?
I wish Kentucky and Wisconsin could BOTH lose, but I’ll settle for Wisconsin getting humbled. #GoCats
@djshort Just three more years until you get 10/5 rights!
@injuryexpert @enosarris Must be an Indiana thing, because 3 Floyds did a Dark Lord variant with ancho that was dynamite.
Not to be a killjoy, but I don’t see two other losses in Chelsea’s fixture list. Arsenal could do them at home, but who else? ManU or ‘Pool?
No question the international break did Alexis a world of good. That was his best game in a month, no question about it. #Class #AFC
@dianagram It really comes down to whether you think Revere will hit any HR at all. If so, he has a shot to outhomer Hamilton.
@dianagram I wouldn’t even bet on him outhomering Jeter, but I suppose anything is possible...
@zvsanders I’m a touch surprised he was still available, but hey, sometimes you catch a break!
People say Twitter needs a sarcasm font, but I’d say it comes through pretty clear here… 
@zvsanders I picked 17 minutes ago, homeboy...
@holly_holl Noooo, my stuff is still there. Wait ’til April 20, then do whatever you want to it!
@KarleeKanz Nah, MLBers can’t get in trouble for pot, I believe. He took a Pee Eee Dee, so he’s pretty much worse than Satan
@jakenyberg This is why we can’t have nice things.
@jakenyberg I’ve been AFK all day, are people *actually* mad at the Twins about this or are you being preemptively dismissive?
@ChrisLongKSTP @jakenyberg All that proves is the team doesn’t spend on free agents. Nothing about Santana’s deal is remarkable at all.
If there's a silver lining for the Twins, it's that they comported themselves better through this than the Angels did. #SmallBlessings
@JJStankevitz well, less than that now...
Dios Mio, that's a terrible break for the Twins and abject idiocy by Santana.
@JamieMottram :shipit: is the best emoji by far. Also, set up the Google drive integration ASAP.
@zvsanders I work with almost all dudes and my wife works with my dad. There had better not be anything for it to know about!
@ATallOrder See, that makes sense to me, but it still doesn’t explain the affair blogs!
Ok, I was just checking to make sure “readhere” was a word. Really not sure how these bottom results apply, @google 
@summeranne How on earth is it not a thing? What else would you call the thing that is clearly a long-sleeved T-shirt?
@jakenyberg Gimme Gangnam. No question.
@enosarris I just want to know, per #20, what kind of copy editor has to deal with someone writing “woot woot” too much...
@dturkenk @cdgoldstein I don’t understand kids either, so I guess Echo and I have something in common!
@jlwoj SMH, I bet he never pitches in the major leagues again.
@harrypav @cdgoldstein @jorgearangure @jay_jaffe A-rod should be rotting in jail. Or hell. Or the jail in hell.
@harrypav @jorgearangure @cdgoldstein @jay_jaffe I always knew I liked A-Rod for a reason. #VivaFajitas!
@JP_Breen @zvsanders I mean, yes, never trust Zach. I don’t mind it, but give me a couple min to make my pick!
@JP_Breen Good heavens, man, give me a second!
@MikeGianella He puts on a pretty fun show. He’s an outstanding musician and it shows more in person than on his albums IMO.
@PhilMackey If that’s a bar in town I’LL MEET YOU THERE!
@PhilMackey A good two-day bender will pretty much get you there.
@jnmcrms Yeah, totally normal then. Let me know if you want food/bar recommendations!
@jnmcrms Depends. Are you trolling him or is he trolling you?
@AndrewSimonMLB @MatthewHLeach What about Liquid Wrench?
@5GrootsPie @Bachsflute We also got lucky in that the person we’re buying from is a family friend and not living there right now
@Bachsflute @5GrootsPie I’m prepared for that eventuality, but bleh, it’s such a horrible process even when it seems to be going smoothly.
@jlwoj @cdgoldstein Woj is indeed correct. THIS TIME AND THIS TIME ONLY.
@webbmedia As usual, Google did most of the best work. 
@Chet_G I know my new testament pretty well. Really well, actually, and I can tell you FOR SURE: Jesus never served any gay people pizza
@Stefmara @jessespector Yeah, but she drops mad beats
@zvsanders we’ll see
@zvsanders Nah, I’m going to pitch well and the IF will be fine. OF...
@zvsanders My OF is going to be a crisis in plaid.
@MillerStrib Hey, at least none of them got popped for drug usage like Mijares did yesterday!
@hangingsliders That’s fantastic, congratulations!!
@5GrootsPie Have fun with the mortgage process! We’re supposed to be closing in two weeks, buuuuuut I kinda doubt it’ll happen.
@zvsanders all you, hoss
@5GrootsPie Super stressful. Where are you in the process?
@Tepper I guess every pantheon needs minor deities...
@StPaulSaints @PioneerPress Could be Caleb's evil twin, in which case it’s a pretty smart move to keep him away from the Twin Cities!

@petebeatty Isn’t that just literally every other day?
@jnmcrms I’m sorry, that’s really shitty.
@jnmcrms Looks like an LA number with a Santa Monica exchange. Not sure that helps, but might narrow your suspects a bit...
@ddocket I hope so, I really do, but I kind of doubt it. Maybe they’ll get the same endorsement deal...
@ddocket Thanks, coach! I’m all about that #BeastMode
@zvsanders Things for scale are supposed to be SMALLER than the item they’re illustrating...
@zvsanders already in BananaPants
@jessespector @holly_holl Idiosyncratic would be a more charitable term, but I don’t disagree with weird and stupid.
@holly_holl @jessespector Baseball lets players play a month in the majors without burning a contract year, it’s just one specific month...
@harrypav @MikeGianella Or at least remember you sometimes.
@cubs2win47 I’ve just received word that Luis Rivas’ pizza did not arrive with the toppings he had ordered. Rough day all around!
Tough day for ex-Twins: Kevin Slowey was cut, as was Alexi Casilla, and now Jose Mijares has been suspended for 50 games. #OldFriends
@Chris_Cwik The Phillies will be tough to top...
This idea appeals to me on many levels, so I’m glad @knightfdn awarded them a grant! #MSP 
@MatthewHLeach @BrianMFloyd @BryanDFischer @ddocket Yeah, that’s…not particularly close.
@Stefmara between this and your Wisconsin fanhood, I’m going to unfollow you for having bad opinions.

@harrypav @holly_holl I will be in Chicago in a month, and I will fight you Harry. I have the time.
@DWolfsonKSTP @SethTweets @Brandon_Warne I’ll admit a predisposition to read quotes like that as whiny, so I may well be in the wrong here.
@SethTweets @Brandon_Warne That makes more sense.
@Brandon_Warne LRT makes me SMH. You can moan about the media coverage when you stop losing 90-100 games a season.
@AdamJanofsky I will be a happier person when media cos. stop giving one Millennial a platform to speak on behalf of the whole generation.

@alexremington @MikeBatesSBN I do not! I currently have 0 children and 0 plans for them, but to save The Simpsons…I might just do it.
@MikeBatesSBN If I thought that was actually a possibility, I’d have kids just to keep the fire alive for one more generation.
@SethTweets I think that’s fine. Maybe a shade early, but at that point he could go at pretty much any moment.

Gathering information on potential surgery vs. rehab call. 4-6 month recovery time + 15k costs is…daunting.
@mattufford It’s definitely still used that way in St. Louis as well, typically to describe outstate folk.
@bgrosnick You know who IS super excited? The Rockies, since they have a chance of not finishing last now!
@sahadevsharma @KevinKaduk Between those knuckleheads and the reemergence of Mariotti, it has been a banner 24 hrs. for the city.
@seanrubin I’ve recently gotten an @AeropressCoffee and won’t shut up about it. It’s the best.
I’d Periscope my day at the office, but I really don’t need more smug chatter about how much coffee I drink in my life.
@mathewi I assume it has already happened on Meerkat, but I’d be impressed if someone had already desecrated Periscope
@RobHart1980 It’s a bit early for brown liquors. Start with champagne and work your way down the pantone scale.
@FSNtylermason I’m sure your kids will love to hear the Legend of Swaggy P, though!
@ddohertyjr Believe it!
@zvsanders @BaseballATeam @JP_Breen In much the same way that these were treats 
@JohnSharkman @ButcherandBoar The best questions always do
The future is pretty great, you guys.
IBM introduced the first 1GB hard drive in 1980; it weighed about 550 pounds and cost $40k. Today, I have 3.5 GB of Decembrists music.
@davidwiers @BaseballATeam @JP_Breen 
@BaseballATeam @JP_Breen and with me and @zvsanders leading the jokes, you know it’s SUPER CLASSY.
@BaseballATeam It could be worse, you could be in the email draft @JP_Breen set up. More chatter than picks!
@holly_holl @cdgoldstein @Marc_Normandin I bet that’s the only non-NSFW image in the entire #adult feed.
@MikeGianella @WoodfordReserve Ooo, thanks for the recommendation! The bourbon trail is definitely on my bucket list.
Didn’t realize I’d be spending the evening fighting my scanner again. Thank goodness for @WoodfordReserve!
Really glad to see good folks like @TRancel and @No_Little_Plans getting sweet new gigs. This is a perfect reminder to #HireErik @erikmal
@Marc_Normandin @holly_holl Does the suit grow if he evolves, or does he hulk out of it when Thunderstones are around?
@FutbolIntellect It’s almost as if the US has failed to find a way to train defenders for nigh on forever.
@MATrueblood @No_Little_Plans “An Inability to Coordinate the Monkeys" is the title of my upcoming book on failure to live up to potential
LRT: One issue I have with articles like that is that they miss the point. The midwest isn’t great because its cheap, it’s objectively great
@No_Little_Plans Bullshit! You are immensely deserving (unless you have someone chained in your basement that actually writes your stuff…)
@MattJMuenster I’ve been meaning to email you, but I’m holding off until after the tourney so you don’t hold my shameful bracket against me
@Chet_G Wider distribution, and far, far, far more accessible beers.
@zvsanders He was my next pick before you grabbed him. Love his R potential with a healthy Votto behind him.
@zvsanders Honestly, I almost waited to see if I could get him coming back around, but there wasn’t anyone I liked notably better there.
@zvsanders nuh uh, check ur email boyyyyyyyyyy.
@A_W_Gordon Alexis, no question. James has a good dog, Alexis has the best dogs.
@holly_holl @Tepper You’re just mad you didn’t think of it first! #SourGrape #GreenEyedMonster #SourEyedMonster #GreenGrapes
@Tepper Is Aarhus in the middle of Aarstreet?
I’m not reaching for him, but Kyle Gibson could be a solid value pick in the late rounds of mixed drafts, esp. if velo stays in mid-90s.
@randalltbush I think it does work because they’re still less monolithic than McD’s. So they’re not small, just smallER
@randalltbush @LeoBurnett That’s my assumption, but it could be repurposed if they needed it to be, unlike the Chipotle music videos.
@randalltbush But yes, at the end of the day, TB is also industrial fast food, so it loses a bit of its luster.
@randalltbush I’m a big fan of the juggalo-looking guards and the muted red/yellow color scheme.
LRT: Really, really great ad by @LeoBurnett for @tacobell and could be cut down to 60s and 30s without losing too much meaning.
@zvsanders @davidwiers Lazy, good for nothing...
@clairbearattack Sturridge is faking his injury, he’ll be fine for Saturday.
@nnelson9 That’s a pretty poor reason to have beef with someone. I SWEAR THAT’S THE LAST ONE I’ll MAKE!
<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>You can go your own Zayn (go your own Zaaaaaayn!)<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
@FutbolIntellect Only issue is Vikings owners want the team to play in their new stadium and will raise hell about a new park.
@JSB_FOX @MNUnitedFC I assume it’s predicated on when they can build a new stadium, but I could be wrong on that.
@ddocket Underrated soccer town, really. If the stadium gets built, it’ll thrive here.
@kbrobaseball If you’ve never had Mac&amp;Cheese with beef at Noodles &amp; Co, let me highly recommend it. Unless you keep kosher. It’s not kosher.
@kbrobaseball Sriracha is a solid addition, especially if you’ve got meat in the mix. Ketchup doesn’t add anything to though!
@thegeach We live in a fallen world full of dark, bad people.
@Tepper @holly_holl It’s sweet and marshmallowy and you can be outside in the summer. Pretty much paradise.
@holly_holl @Tepper Thank you for validating my theory that Texans are bad and should be stricken from the earth,
@xmasape He’s not wrong about Siri though...
@MikeFerrinSXM @holly_holl @Chris_Cwik Isn’t this is the plot of “Ransom of Red Chief”?
@holly_holl Look, @MikeFerrinSXM will keep him from getting in a stranger’s van and at this point that’s all we can really do...
This Heinz/Kraft merger has brought out of the woodwork a number of people who put ketchup on mac &amp; cheese. What is wrong with you people!?
I love ESPN calling @bomani_jones’ new show “evocative,” aka “our call screeners are going to need therapy for PTSD after each shift."
@No_Little_Plans Awesome!! Congrats, man!
@CompleteArse Yes, it was called “my entire dating life” and it was terrible.

@FutbolIntellect Man, I balled so hard last week, tbh it would have been a slap in the face if I *hadn’t* gotten it.

@Stefmara @jessespector In a small town it could work, but never in a place like NYC or Chicago.
@jnmcrms Archeologists in 2725 will speculate as to the reason that there were two 2017 World Champions for the only time in history.
@holly_holl @emmaspan Just because they’re both golden labs? That’s breedist, Holly. You’re a breedist!
@mallelis With Ian McShane? I was SO MAD when they canceled that!
@andymoney69 LiveJournal is still a top-100 website in the world. Blew my mind!
@RotowireATC @injuryexpert @Jeff_Erickson I believe so, but it’s been a bit since I looked at that data. Isn’t DAS a nerve conduction issue?
@AmeriGunner Sanchez, Cazorla, Per, uh….Chambers…Kos?
@benpopper I also feel like jerk can be a temporary state in a way that asshole is more of a chronic condition.
@benpopper A jerk is aggressive and abrasive, while an asshole is just…awful. Active or passive, he or she is just an all-around plague.
@desusnice Even Batman villains have a logical consistency that Zimmerman seems to lack.
@Jeff_Erickson @RotowireATC The last guy who actually had dead arm was Phil Hughes IIRC. No test showed anything wrong, he was just…dead.
@Jeff_Erickson @RotowireATC I did some research on dead arm with @injuryexpert and concluded it basically isn’t a diagnosis, it’s a symptom
Anyone have a #jquery resource they like? It seems that, once again, I need to learn it.
@Sky_Kalkman @baseballpro It’s too early for that level of cleverness.
@Sky_Kalkman I just ran over to the @baseballpro homepage to see what was up before I realized you mean Phillips’ idiocy.

@Chris_Cwik Ben Wyatt is inappropriately close to me. I approve of Adam Scott’s portrayal tho...

@RachelEKellogg I was going to make a snake handlers joke, but @mallelis already made all the good ones.
@CoryHepola @kare11 Hey, hey! Congratulations, Cory!
@RachelEKellogg @mallelis Sort of, it’s called The BGC (Baptist General Conference) but it’s pretty much the same thing.
@RachelEKellogg @mallelis Easily one of my all time favorite jokes, and not just because I grew up Northern Baptist, great lakes region.
@RachelEKellogg @mallelis I’m pretty sure the Emo Philips joke about religion (
@GrahamDavidA @mallelis @Sedna_51 I love Tenebrae, but that’s Thursday, damn it!

@mallelis COME ON, IT’S MY ONE CHANCE TO PERFORM RACHMANINOFF’S ALL-NIGHT VIGIL, JUST LET ME HAVE THIS.
@mallelis Well sure, if you’re then going to vigil later and Easter morning service the next day.
@DSzymborski GlaDOS would be the most malevolent commissioner ever, but at least the threat of neurotoxin would prevent dropouts!
A tip of the hat to @jay_jaffe for the “Pitch to contract” line re: Nolasco. Well played. 
@arsenaloFka Have you ever done a CAD reproduction of the Arsenal crest?
@BLarsenAFC1886 Probably guessing based on Costa’s suspension. Of course that assumes the FA is consistent in their punishments, which, lol.
@CadChica I cannot believe a prosecutor thought that was an appropriate penalty for him. There must be something I’m missing.
@WillGordonAgain I was surprised by how much I liked it, especially paired with a DIPA. Made it almost like a sour.
@WillGordonAgain I actually had a decent radler over the weekend — shocking, I know — but it was made with Kombucha rather than juice.
@MikeIsaac Pretty sure “Big Spender” would go over well with that crowd.
@Brandon_Warne @PhilMackey He also doesn’t think he did anything wrong, which is the core issue.
@Brandon_Warne @PhilMackey Definitely AP. Not sure what the Vikings could have done better to both save face and not hang him out to dry.
Comcast will *NEVER* lose a race to the bottom. Even if you luck out and get a helpful rep, corporate idiocy reigns supreme.
@MikeGianella @jlwoj So glad we amended the constitution to make grills a fundamental right.
@Brandon_Warne your guess is as good as mine. Might have to actually listen to that soundcloud...

Mike Ashley is seeing Giroud in his nightmares. #AFC
Giroud! So hot right now!
No question the first yellow card in this game will be for an #Arsenal frustration foul after getting the crap kicked out of them all game.
@5GrootsPie I care that you’re no longer in Newark. That seems like a platonic good.

@MikeGianella With Heidi Klum dressed as an umpire telling contestants that they are out.
@rui_xu @drewsilv Yep, exactly. Also, weirdly, Green Bay: 
@rui_xu @drewsilv It lives and dies on the location. Would kill near a college campus, but close in a month in the suburbs.
@jlpauk @drewsilv Also, the more your drink, the longer the game is going to take, ESPECIALLY for Diplomacy.
@jlpauk @drewsilv My crew plays fast, so probably ~ a pint per game. But we’re playing no fewer than 2-3 games, so it evens out.
@drewsilv And I’ll make my money off the booze and selling videos of drunk patrons FREAKING THE HELL OUT when they lose.
@drewsilv I badly want to make a bar that specializes in craft beer and strategy games like Chess, Settlers, Diplomacy etc.
@jlwoj @davidwiers @holly_holl @Chris_Cwik THERE WERE FURTHER IGNOMINIOUS EXTORTIONS

@petegaines @TomFornelli I also have a soft spot in my heart for Sarpinos and their damn-near-24-hr delivery.

@mattufford That level of #Engagement makes me feel bad about my #Content.
@thian_un well, unfortunately, so is mine. It’s just also a dumping ground...
@Tepper Am. Politics am stupid. (I think it’s are, but more likely than not it’s context dependent)
@thian_un that’s a much healthier way to do it. At this point, I’d need to take 3-4 days off to get it done.
@thian_un Well, you’re a fair bit ahead of me. About 30,400 give or take...

Things you learn on @baseball_ref: Bruce Bochy was born in France. #TheMoreYouKnow
@dennetOTM 100% agreed. Sometimes it works — Torre, Bochy — sometimes the odd guys work like Maddon. Not sure there’s any reason to it.
@dennetOTM Sure, but that’s neither here nor there. Molitor isn’t responsible for roster-building yet; I’ll judge him based on what he has
@zvsanders I’m not about to blame a 90-loss season on him, though. He could be MOY and still have a team that gets a top-5 pick.
I have no idea if Paul Molitor will be a good manage once the games actually start, but I’ve been impressed with what he’s said to the press
@AdamBez @dbrauer Wow, that is…really special. I guess they can’t afford a web designer.
@dbrauer Yeah, and whatever you can say about the design, there is absolutely no content there.
@dbrauer I mean, Donaldson is a $5B company and this is their website:

@BizballMaury @keithlaw If one wanted to dig deeper, I’d make a parallel to Sierra Nevada or one of the other early west coast IPA brewers

@keithlaw @BizballMaury Clearly. (See also Anheiser-Busch or MillerCoors products)
@BizballMaury @keithlaw But what’s the virtue in consistently bad coffee? Side note: I’m getting an Aeropress tomorrow. Any tips?

My heart is going to explode #Arsenal
The variety of predictions for exactly how Arsenal will muck this up in my feed tells you how the last few years have gone for us in the CL.
@FutbolIntellect That’s pretty close to my prediction of win 3-1, then lose it in ET.
Surely not…SURELY NOT….. COME ON, YOU GUNNERS!!!!
@TheShortFuse It’s flickering, but still there
GIROUD!!!!! #MiracleInMonaco? #GameOn
Come on, you Gunners! #AFC
@Phylan Best shot they’ve got of a 3-0 win, IMO, is one goal just before halftime, then two in quick succession in the late 70-80 min range
@arsenaloFka pfft, none that matter.
@Heisenbergkamp My sources within the team have confirmed this. They are indeed going for it.
@Heisenbergkamp aren’t most discovery responses just “F*** off and die”? No, wait, sorry that’s FOIA responses...

@sirsean @PhilMackey Apologies in advance for the long reply that’s forthcoming...
@PhilMackey No way I’d ever let my kid play football. I played 1 season of PeeWee and got a concussion. Not rolling dice my kid does worse
@PhilMackey One reason CFB/NFL may survive: 22 starters all cashing major checks vs 11 in soccer, 9 MLB, 5 NBA. Better odds playing football
@PhilMackey Bigger issue — in my eyes — is how many players will never start. MLB, NBA, even soccer pay plenty well for elite talent.
@_SCTW Puma strikes me more as a “off in the bathroom doing cocaine” type of kid

When this ends 0-0, I’m not going to be a happy camper. #Arsenal
@harrypav I don’t feel like 55 mph from a non-athlete isn’t that bad. I mean, it’s no worse than, say, Livan Hernandez...
@BobbyBigWheel @bomani_jones Or if there was a similar case they knew about and didn’t expel people for, which would kill their case.
@bomani_jones @BobbyBigWheel I tend to agree, since the University has plenty to lose in discovery as well. Damn shame, though.
@mattlindner I thought that one closed first because of a rent dispute?
@dustinparkes Could to do a responsive site with a tablet-native app IF IF IF IF you had enough rich media to make that a smart play.
@dustinparkes TBH I’d be pushing for Snapchat integration with the way people R A V E about Discover for media companies.
@mattlindner So wait, do they have ANY physical location now? Man, the city went to hell after I left! (Except Hyde Park, which got nice…)
@mattlindner Unless you’re going to the Cubs game or Goose Island, pretty much no reason to be there.
@dustinparkes Big part of the decline is the replacement cycles on tablets are slow. I’m unwilling to punt on tablets as functional tech yet
@mattlindner Friday/Payday/St. Patty’s is tomorrow = STAY AWAY FROM WRIGLEYVILLE TONIGHT #GoodNightandGoodLuck

@MJ_Baumann @ThisPhillyFan and he’s going to have to rehab it at some point. Even if he never pitches again, it’s not like he’ll leave it be
@sporer I can’t imagine a team that had real aspirations that were in any way tied to Gavin Floyd...
@cjdubbya Definitely. I’m surprised to see STL still in there, but if they get a new stadium, they should lead the wave after this one.
“Since the rest of your defense is leaving…” RT @GoesslingESPN: #Vikings have called to express interest in 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver
@jh_moore I feel like that wouldn’t have held up on appeal, but I guess it does get you to 94k pretty quickly!
@jh_moore What on earth do you do to amass 94k in fines?!
@dturkenk I know. I kinda feel like this is my peak
@KALuther nm, wrong one.
@KALuther It would really just be what’s happened today. and also 
@WattsMR Slidin’ in like 
@mikeaxisa Man, I don’t even know what COULD top that.
@Stefmara I KNOW!
@alexremington I KNOW, but I don’t have any moves...
@jnmcrms I’m giggling like an idiot rn
LRT: GUYS!
@MikeFerrinSXM @CespedesBBQ Counterpoint: Don’t go to class
@Baer_Bill ~♫Too Many Bees♫~
@wezen_ball Oh most definitely. If I had missed it, I would be SUPER grateful.
@wezen_ball I did grab one, but thanks for sending it!
@sporer I would kill to have a Koosh basketball hoop in my office right now. Posterize my coworkers and send to the First Lady #Awesome
@Chicago2Chelsea This is the best, nothing’s going to top this.
@jacobdfriedman I would have, but she already deleted it...
@jeff_underscore This might be the proudest moment of my sad life
@mike_petriello He even has a team for this! He has a social coordinator and everything, but still, not a word. Shame really...
@ParkerHageman What I wouldn’t give for a Koosh basketball hoop in my office right now...
@WattsMR It really, really is. Outside of the official NBA account or Dwyane himself, I don’t know where we go from here.
@AndrewSimonMLB I cannot overstate how much I’m loving this. Best Ever.
If I didn’t have a ton of work to get done today, I would absolutely be heading to a basketball court to film my #MadSkillz
@47ElysianFields @FLOTUS SHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
LRT: HOLY CRAP THAT’S HER VERIFIED ACCOUNT!!!!
@BLarsenAFC1886 AOC’s run was spectacular leading to that goal, but getting lost in the shuffle was Ozil's inch-perfect pass to start it off
@DSzymborski Stockholm Syndrome is a hell of a thing!
@holly_holl @cdgoldstein I think WEN is what my wife uses and LOVES. I’m more of a “wear a hat” kind of guy...
@Arsenal_KY SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON!
@CompleteArse I’m so glad he did! LVG shit all over him on the way out the door, so no reason not to glory in knock the Dutch bastard out!
@arsenaloFka Cheers! You must be the happiest of us all!!
Scenes that Welbeck scored the winner and we’re heading to Wembley at United’s expense!!! #AFC #SheWoreAYellowRibbon
@Heisenbergkamp I wasn’t worried about an anti-Arsenal bias today, but I was worried about a pro-home team bias, which does typically exist
Di Maria, clothing himself in glory once again… Great signing, LVG!
If Dat Guy knocks United out of the #FACup, I’m going to be ELATED. Come on, #Arsenal, see this one through!
@Gooner_In_BCN My #1 example of pseudoscience in sport. Absolutely love it!
@Swydan Oh yeah, Prime is a fixed cost for us, no doubt.
@Swydan Access to first-run movies might be a tipping point for me. Also my love of The Wire and Deadwood.
@CarlosGil83 Sounds like you’re well on your way!
Whelp, back to honors even...
@CarlosGil83 Backpacking through Europe or South America
Nacho?? Are you kidding me?! #GETIN #1NilToTheArsenal
The Old Trafford HooDoo is strong
There is no question in my mind that #Arsenal are the better team right now, but I’m still having trouble seeing how they win tonight.
@ajwalsh08 No price given yet, yes you want one, donate it to a school or charity.
@jakenyberg Man, I loved my gateway box! What great branding, too...
Almost as interesting to me as the #AppleWatchEvent is what will happen to the @Pebble kickstarter immediately after the event ends.
@rocketpig76 I wish I’d bought when I first thought about it in high school, but I was saving for college. Stupid college...
@rocketpig76 Except they moved into that market with the 5c, which most cell providers can offer for free.
@rocketpig76 Ahhh, that’s a shame. If they could get one in the ~200-250 range, I bet it’d kill!
@rocketpig76 Really? Was that at the last keynote?
T-minus one hour until Apple owns your wrists. Or until the first batch of lifestream bugs pop up, either/or.
@WesYee I bet the Rangers would at least give him a workout at this point...
@MJ_Baumann wut u say m8?
@ddocket Wow, he sure is angry... 
@happierman @trentofsky Regifting. You can definitely look a regifted horse in the mouth.
@ajwalsh08 I haven’t, but @Nefertari224 probably has.
@jakenyberg I resent being called a woo girl, but I’d be lying if I said that wasn’t my jam.
@cjzero @SteveRushin All is right with the world
@mattpuettmann I’d also accept 10 bloody marys
@mattpuettmann I TOLD YOU! I TOLD YOU LIKE 10 TIMES!
@CompleteArse @BLarsenAFC1886 You and my wife would get along famously!
@anildash The fuck did he do!?
@jimhammerand I told a class of high schoolers dropping out of grad school was “a pretty good idea for most people” so you’re ahead of me!
@DSzymborski @BChad50 I also tore my hip labrum, which made exercise virtually impossible.
@DSzymborski @BChad50 Stress eating in the office and no time to cook the way we did before. Lead to quicker/worse choices.
@DSzymborski @BChad50 I lost 70 pounds working at home, then started working in an office again and promptly put it all back on.
@A_W_Gordon He’d sign a 10-day contract just so he could show up.
@A_W_Gordon Wade Boggs. He’d crash the combine just for that event.
@JJStankevitz You’re now on #BrawlWatch. If Carlos gets hit again…It’s going down.
@surlybrewing @rabonour @WillGordonAgain @DOOMTREE Speaking of which! I was looking at that last night. What style is it?
@PSLifeStyle @NaughtyDog If they don’t name it “The Second To Last Of Us” that’s a huge missed opportunity.
"Özil’s the pea in the shell game, perpetually moving, but never where you’re actually looking.” YES. THIS. 
@rabonour ahhh, my bad. They are awesome looking cans! (Thank goodness nothing about that tweet could be taken out of context…)
@rabonour @WillGordonAgain Nothing against Other Half, but I doubt @surlybrewing is going to give up the Best Canned Beer title willingly.
@PFTCommenter Joes about TELLING not spellling
@Baer_Bill I love the idea that they were the majority was ever in doubt. No shit, sherlock, that’s *part of the problem*
@jeffpaternostro @enosarris He isn’t, he’s a giant invisible rabbit!
@sabometrics For every run he allows, David Wright is going to throw away a meal the next day.
@teen_archer I loved it for my personal, but until I can get my Bizniz email on there, too, it’s useless to me.
So many people in my feed talking about Harvey, it’s as though the entirety of New York started hallucinating an invisible rabbit.
@CadChica @ddocket @BMarshh54 Ooo, this is a weird case! But yes, welcome to the club of mistaken identities, what size T-shirt do you want?
@BLarsenAFC1886 I couldn’t believe Podolski’s ability to show up HUGE in FA Cup games and then disappear in the league/CL games.
@jmarthaler @TwinsGeek Oh man, keep me posted on this, I’d love to chip in!
@BSLJeffLong @Life_Floor @seanrubin It was great for learning how to do markdowns, which is great for how we set up some of the pages.
@BSLJeffLong I got to learn all about 301 redirects and how much SEO damage you can do in 24 hrs. Good times!
@MaggieLaMaack Is that more or less indicative of a sociopath than using three commas as though they made an ellipsis?
@howardmegdal @PatVenditte He’s the perfect remedy to pace-of-play issues. A LOOGY and ROOGY all in one, no additional warm-up needed!
@wezen_ball I did almost slip on some ice this morning, so I may be splash damage from whatever gypsy they angered… Thanks for the warning!
@AmeriGunner Man I had high hopes for Eisfeld. Such a shame he never hit is potential.
LRT: Guessing Ryan was talking about the 2016 postseason and even that might be a touch aggressive...
@cdgoldstein @MikeGianella Ello!?
First, Leonard Nimoy dies, now Harrison Ford is critically hurt. Someone put Edward James Olmos in protective custody!
@cdgoldstein Come on, you didn’t even go for Sucks-to-be Yoon? That’s not even low-hanging fruit, that’s rotted-on-the-ground fruit.
@TwinkieTown I think that’s probably my choice as well, with an eye to deal him early in those years to maximize his value.
@TwinkieTown Not saying they should, but just noting that there may be a substantial penalty if they wait.
@TwinkieTown Beware Joe Mauer Syndrome: Waiting too long may make an extension extremely expensive. Could get below market rate now.
@drewsilv @craigcalcaterra The Yankees are going to run out of numbers looooooooong before then!
@jh_moore It’s going to be above freezing tomorrow, though. If that’s not spring, I don’t know what is!
@WFNYJacob First way = they’re happy. Second way = they’re a psychopath and soon to lash out violently at the ones around them.
@MikeIsaac only issue to mainstream usage is monetization. I’m sure for amateur stuff, it already has been.
@MikeBatesSBN @anildash has been on fire today with #Fhqwhgadzi. It’s really a sight to behold!
@dturkenk @jlwoj Yeah, where was the #humblebrag on that one?
LRT: That was the best possible tweet. Please log off in an orderly fashion and find your next social network, this one is closed now.
@CompleteArse It was a really awkward phase for…oh you meant the movie. Didn’t see it, but I hear good things!
@dianagram I thought all in-season exhibitions were banned after too many MLB teams got beat on barnstorming tours...
@dcwoodruff @srassen7 It reminds me of a toxic version of “Red Sox Nation”. It puzzles me that national media were so willing to run with it
@srassen7 @dcwoodruff Can’t recall a single person using #BFIB as anything but a joke. Maybe it’s an outstate thing?
@srassen7 @dcwoodruff I’m not going to dispute your experience, but I lived and worked within 1mi of the stadium for the last two years and
@srassen7 @dcwoodruff Except no one *actually* says that seriously. It’s always said with an eye roll or sarcastically.
@jnmcrms @Phylan It’s nothing more than a wolf-whistle for people who already dislike the Cardinals.
@mattlindner Trust-but-Verify doesn’t seem strong enough
@BSLJeffLong I’m so done with interviewing one person and calling it somehow representative of an entire age group/race/gender
Block @RapSheel and your NFL offseason will be better, I promise.
@mattlindner @RapSheel Fake account Fake account Fake account Fake account
@craigcalcaterra How many other teams are even asked about how little they talk though?
@matthewcerrone I swear by @customink. IDK how they compete on price, but I’ve loved everything I’ve gotten from them.
@jnmcrms Do we count managers? If so, my wife swears by Mike Matheny’s
@BSLJeffLong @jessespector @cdgoldstein Wait, having butter on a bagel makes it a sandwich in New York? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!?
@WesleyLowery The top response to that is another special thing of beauty all its own. Yikes.
@Bill_TPA Yep, he’d be just another Jeff Bagwell
@emmaspan @pizzacutter4 @EndTheWord I used it until I had a cousin born with Down’s. Wasn’t hard to cut out when I made it a priority.
@CApuffin Looking like or appealing to?
@cjdubbya @AmeriGunner Indy would make a ton of sense. If the franchise were older, they’d be a serious contender  for one of the open spots
@cjdubbya @AmeriGunner I’d be surprised to see SA beat out MSP. MSP is the 15th largest market, SA is 37th. Plus, new downtown stadium here.
@AmeriGunner To support (at least until @MNUnitedFC get promoted)
Glad to hear #MLS avoided a strike. I guess I have to pick a team now, eh?
@kbrobaseball yeah, exactly
@kbrobaseball It was weird, but I kinda liked it...
@mattymatty2000 I think this was intended for you: 
@mattymatty2000 Have fun explaining the Puritans to said 6-year-old!
@jlwoj Not sure he has the arm needed to throw a runner out at home tbqh
@JHamrahi @cdgoldstein Weirdly, I’m more ok with that being a sandwich than a normal hot dog...
@FutbolsaCountry Amazing to see him and Coquelin emerge this season. The future is bright, esp. if Gabriel can come along.
@suss2hyphens I think I saw them open for Sam Fold at a bar in Chicago. Not bad, IIRC.
@arsenaloFka If the result is the same, I’ll take it!
@euqubud He’s a phony.
@Chris_Cwik Trader. (kidding, congrats man!)
@enosarris All I could think of when I saw that "Slow down. The sidewalk’s for regular walking not for fancy walking" 
@_Trequartiista_ Woj is sick apparently (not you, @jlwoj, but maybe also you?)
@SethTweets @moochiepoodle I still wear my Slowey jersey around!
@JP_Breen Answer: Barry Bonds, always Barry Bonds.
With even a passable draft, the Bills are in great position to win the offseason. Which means absolutely nothing for the actual season.
@BLarsenAFC1886 Phenomenal goal and great composure by Porter to finish it. Still, that GK has to feel terrible about getting 5-holed there.
@A_W_Gordon Scheme doesn’t seem to have nearly the insidious context in British English that is does in American English. Shame, really.
@nickcicero I’m convinced that the more clever the name, the longer it takes to die. Flock-to-Unlock is terribly clever, ergo it’s immortal
@ironmikegallego @jlwoj @cfCollision Edwin van der Sar? Come on, man, you’re killing me with that!
@jlwoj Because they’re cute and warm?
Alonso seems like a pretty light return for McCoy, I wonder if this will change the Vikings thoughts about trying to deal AP.
@hangingsliders Doesn’t giving one up to Jason Pridie require finishing the bottle or something?
@Chris_Cwik if you call me, I can just yell stream-of-consciousness hot takes at you. $9.95 for the first 10 minutes, then $5/min after that
@rui_xu Nah, it’s probably fine.
@rui_xu making peace with your past is an important step toward adulthood. Making friends with it is quite impressive.
@waydownLo @EdgeofSports That’s part of it, but I think there is positional value in looking like the side who is actually trying to deal
@EdgeofSports Do you see any value in trying not to poison the well and keep things behind closed doors until a strike actually happens?
@larsleafblad @GreaterMSP Organizations like @1millioncups and other outreach and community orgs, have a huge opportunity now.
Target layoffs are awful, full stop. If there’s a silver lining, it’s that there will be a ton of talent available to fuel #startups in #MSP
@daynperry Congrats to @jlwoj on his new skull!
Brilliant move by @Twolves_PR to send out 50% off coupons to anyone who got KG tickets last night. Betting they see good ROI on that.
@Swydan Excellent use of one of my all-time favorite GIFs
@KALuther Anyone who still believes that will find a way to excuse the report. Rose colored glasses do not come off quickly or easily.
@Swydan Still better than Rule V draft tweets...
@nnelson9 @AaronGleeman They view him as a waste of carbon and can’t wait for the day they can use his remains to power a bullpen car.
@KALuther probably the least surprising news story of the day, even behind “dog bites man"
@bosoxholic Ah, sorry. Try now.
@bosoxholic DM me your email addy and I’ll send one along!
Anyone still looking for a #This invite? If so, I haz them to give away.
@bomani_jones A death wish
Not impressed with Gary Neal tonight.
Saundra needs to ring in either Hollywood Robinson or Shane Heal for the last 64 seconds. #NeedABigThree
Damn, Zach LaVine is fun to watch! #Twolves
Awesome to be back at the #twolves game for the first time in YEARS. Thanks for the free tix, KG! 
@johntmeyer Uh…backlinks to our respective websites? lol, I hadn’t thought that far!
@johntmeyer given the consistency with which we are still acquiring Facebook likes on TwinsMVB’s page, we should relaunch!
@FutbolIntellect I wonder if they’re absolutely loving this or are completely mortified right now.
@ddocket Ahahahahaha, that’s awesome! That’s better than the NBA Canada account screwing mine up!
@SBNation Is it Flo-Jo?
@SBNation Is it @jon_bois?
@davidwiers It’s spring training for everyone.
@davidwiers v. nice.
@davidwiers You’ll be first against the wall when the Apple Death Squads — who rove the countryside in immaculate uniforms — find you.
@jeffsussna @GeorgeReese @dturkenk Oh nice! I’m looking at houses in St. Paul right now, so we’ll have to swap notes on good spots.
@GeorgeReese @dturkenk @jeffsussna Thanks!
@SBNation Animal, Equipment, or Logo?
@dturkenk Super helpful, thanks! You’re a swell dude, a real man’s man. Brosidon, king of the brocean.
@kbrobaseball Thanks!
Anyone have a preferred parking spot near the #TargetCenter?
@AmeriGunner That’s child abuse. I should know, I was raised a Vikings/Twins/Twolves fan.
@AmeriGunner I *LOVE* the idea of someone hating FB so much they storm the streets, trash pubs, and fight with cops about it.
@adamjohnson on behalf of @ddocket, myself, and everyone else with similar handles to pro athletes: Good luck today. #TurnOffNotifications
@AmeriGunner We use one every week for a meeting, so I’m a fan. Everything else in G+ I can take or leave, so I like this move.
@AmeriGunner They’re splitting off photos and streams into standalone products (probably Hangouts as well) doesn’t bode well for G+’s future
Big day for $GOOG with the de facto shuttering of G+ and the announcement of wireless service in the US. Both good calls, IMO.
Got my tickets from KG for tonight’s #Twolves game! It’ll be like 1998 all over again
@MikeFerrinSXM @dturkenk Well, I’m certainly not going to tell you how to live your life, but I will say it’s exhilarating!
@MikeFerrinSXM @dturkenk Pfft, like you EVER wear pants, radio boy.
@dturkenk Aw man, does that mean they got access to my camera? Oh well, they say “dance like no one’s watching” right??

@KatieNadeau I really thought they were dying out, but apparently not. A shame, really.
@amandarykoff 
@ddocket my thoughts are with you during this difficult time #BeastMode RT @AdamSchefter: Cardinals announced they released Darnell Dockett.

@Bill_TPA no, this is the weirdest: 
We’re going to go out more shamefully to Monaco than we did to Bayern.
Terrible result still, but man that is a HUGE goal. Arsenal have a shade of hope heading to Monaco.
@adamstillman87 FFS, I should have known this was going to be horrible.

Any wrestling fans out there (@PhilMackey, @Brandon_Warne etc) still looking for a soccer team? I found one for you! 
@jon_bois Couldn’t make a living as a writer and I’m not strong enough to mine coal.
@mike_marcotte If that’s a urine sample, the patient who submitted it is very, very, very, very sick.
If results hold, this will be a very, very good day for #MCFC and #AFC. Let’s go Burnley + Swansea!
@holly_holl Thanks, Holly!
@zvsanders Thanks, Zach!
@LeanderAlphabet This is, quite literally, the same facile argument people make about diving. Hasn’t killed interest in soccer yet, has it?
@injuryexpert meaning weaker surrounding musculature?
@VorosM @ctrent @Enquirer I thought Badenhophates were something you could order at a soda fountain, like an egg creme.
@Heisenbergkamp @TheAVClub Needs more Slo-Mo
@MikeBatesSBN @Swydan Sounds like you and Michael Cuddyer have a two-man act that’s ready for the big leagues!
@davidwiers They’re fantastic, and the get even better when you hold them over a candle and start to melt the insides
@davidwiers @5GrootsPie @cdgoldstein You must be confusing me for @zvsanders. We’ve never met IRL.
@davidwiers FIGHT. ME.
@mathewi Is there anything else even in the conversation? I guess “You can’t explain that” might be up there too...
@davidwiers SnackGraphs and @cdgoldstein’s Sandwich Prospectus would be wonderfully complementary sites.
@jakebeckman Take it easy, Jake, the weekend is just getting started. Marathon, not a sprint.
@ddocket Thanks my man! I hope so too!
I have little to no hope of that last tweet working, but @ddocket inspired me to give it a try. #BeastMode
Hey @DwyaneWade, it’s my birthday, can I get a shoutout?
@JP_Breen There’s no way they’ll do it, but it seems like 90 seconds might be the sweet spot for ads instead of the current 2:30 breaks.
@Parker_Adderson That asshole is going to put the priests and omen-readers out of business. #HinkieOut
@JoelHenard Thanks, Joel!
LRT gets my full professional endorsement
@injuryexpert Wow, I hope the author won a bet by sneaking "poopsicle" in there!
Just starting to get into @DOOMTREE, but, wow, are they amazingly good.
@Chris_Cwik @cdgoldstein NO TINOS! #NoTomkosEither
@cdgoldstein @Chris_Cwik Not TINO
@Heisenbergkamp I resent the implication that I’m weird. I…just…really liked maps as a kid and I hate losing.
@Chris_Cwik @erikmal Not going to fight you too much on that one, but my cats DO think they’re dogs. And are self-relient.
@Chris_Cwik @erikmal I can counter with two cats, one of which WILL sleep on your lap.
@Chris_Cwik @erikmal I would like to counter with a nicer couch
I wonder what Shane Heal is up to these days… #Twolves
@LaVelleNeal Red Nissan Cube?
@ProductiveOuts @bensbiz @KCCougars How on earth isn’t “Class-A Le” one of the choices?!
This is great news for anyone with an iPhone 6+! #HugePockets 
@AndrewSimonMLB Wait, are we sure that’s real? If so, that is a DYNAMITE ‘stache
@TomFornelli Same reason the Twins brought back Torii Hunter: Nostalgia and some abstract notion of “veteran presence"
@drewsilv Probably hasn’t had to live with his parents after high school either. Damn, I thought we had our prophet...
@MikeBatesSBN Kid Odor, unless we can abbreviate Rougned Odor the Younger to ROY.
@drewsilv He’s the apotheosis of millennials!
@drewsilv He’s also already changed employers once and caused management consternation by his work habits even though they may not be wrong.
@MikeBatesSBN @JPosnanski One of us, One of us!
@ParkerHageman I don’t know, Hunter’s arms are pretty long. He can probably still punch Buxton if Hicks ducks in time.
@jessespector That is, in all candor, very clever. Be proud of that one!
As I add @jon_bois’ latest dispatch on Radio Shack to This, I’m reminded that I have This invites if anyone wants one.
@jessespector Do you also enjoy yelling “He’s supposed to have two!” when a reporter says “He has a knee” instead of “knee injury”?
@CompleteArse Night, Kista!
Also, what a flashback to 2007, when both Torii Hunter and Kevin Garnett played in MSP!
Glad to see @cjzero and @seankjensen as puzzled as I am that the Wolves are trying to bring KG back. Doesn’t make sense to me either.
Serious question: How many of these are hate mail/death threats?


@mattpuettmann Is cocaine water soluble?
@mattpuettmann Did you see my Rob Ford mug?
@jessespector He wants Obama to nuke Fox News???
@clairbearattack I think I would have an easier time kicking heroin than White Cheddar Cheez-Its.
I don’t envy their monitization challenge, but that’s far too little for their size RT @MikeIsaac: reddit's 2014 revenue: $8.3 million
@celebrityhottub Doesn’t a personality test require you to have a personality to test?
Gotta say, I did not expect a new Harper Lee book AND a new Dr. Seuss book to be released this year….
@jonahkeri Smart.
@keithlaw @lessick @dianagram @sabometrics Hugely problematic, and a disservice to OK students, who will get KILLED in college classes
@lessick @keithlaw @dianagram @sabometrics I would agree with that. Just uncomfortable with the tone of “sermons have no place in history"
@keithlaw @dianagram @sabometrics If for no other reason than contextualizing the cultural climate of their eras
@keithlaw @dianagram @sabometrics I feel like “City on a Hill” and even “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God” have solid historical value
@cdgoldstein @BSLJeffLong I never pegged you for a Marxist agitator, Craij, AND SO CLOSE TO OUR NATIONS CAPITAL!
@BSLJeffLong @cdgoldstein The disclosures alone would make it a horrifying nightmare for the owners.
@Heisenbergkamp Buy him or her a snow shovel with “Congrats and good luck!” on the card.
@BLarsenAFC1886 @Heisenbergkamp there's an informal one in baseball where opposing players' wives/families sit. It's weirdly fun.
@BLarsenAFC1886 Don’t worry, now PSG will buy him this summer for 100m pounds.
@Heisenbergkamp I think he also likes being the singular star of the show. Daily Show is always about Host + Correspondents.
George R.R. Martin’s writing pace #ThingsArodShouldApologizeFor
@MikeGianella Would you settle for Frank Calliendo as James Earl Jones?
LRT is great, wonderful news. Might be the best show on TV right now.
Pretty soon I’m just going to start tweeting the lyrics to “Boot to the Head” with #ThingsArodShouldApologizeFor attached to it. #DrDemento
50 SHADES OF GREY #ThingsArodShouldApologizeFor
@ERolfPleiss Nooooooooooooo
The awkwardness of having Eddie Murphey on #SNL40 for like 30 seconds. #ThingsArodShouldApologizeFor
The practice of adding the suffix -gate to every stupid controversy #ThingsArodShouldApologizeFor
@NotTheCubsWay I deny the existence of said album. I have no idea what you’re talking about.

@hangingsliders @howardmegdal @david_j_roth He is, without question, history’s greatest monster.
@erikmal To be fair, this was a much better tweet than that one.
@Heisenbergkamp Considering the last one is literally, “don’t interact with me on Twitter” I’d say that’s her preference, yes.
@octonion @Bbl_Astrophyscs Ice. Ice. Ice. Ice. Keeps the swelling down, you’ll feel a lot better, I promise.
@MikeIsaac @fmanjoo Forget Wheaties, cold pizza is the real breakfast of champions.
@nickwoltman @atrupar I like the implication in the last quote that “assclown” and “celebrity” are more or less equivalent.
@JohnSharkman Hey, we’ll finally have a chance to catch a beer!
@larsleafblad It’s so true! Everyone in STL thought we were crazy for moving back, but there’s just something so special about MSP.
@larsleafblad I hadn’t heard "It’s really hard to get people to move to Minneapolis, and it’s impossible to get them to leave” before but...
@hangingsliders good luck and Godspeed.
@BrentSGambill @AdamNavarrete @fangraphs Would love to see this done with sentiment analysis attached to it.
@PSLifeStyle Journey and Portal 1 are both very short and yet two of my top 5 games of all time.
@ajwalsh08 If you told me this was Peak Sufjan, I wouldn’t fight you. 
@FutbolsaCountry Scenes! Forget nuclear fusion, narrative is the most powerful force in the universe.
@ajwalsh08 Have you heard “Lord God Bird”?
@edsbs YOU SHALL NOT CRUCIFY THE SEC ON A CROSS OF GOLD!
@CompleteArse Sure, but I can feel joy for both his loss AND PNE’s win this way. Also, the fact that I think we can beat PNE.
@davidwiers @chadyoung @enosarris @zvsanders @jeffwzimmerman Right, but that’s proxy. Would need to know warmup pitches to get the real deal
@davidwiers @chadyoung @enosarris @zvsanders @jeffwzimmerman Would love to get a fatigue factor in here, but that’s nigh impossible
@davidwiers @chadyoung @enosarris @zvsanders @jeffwzimmerman The ideal would be a ~500 team that lost in blowouts and won close games
@chadyoung @zvsanders @davidwiers Seems like something we could extrapolate with pythagorean expectations, then check back after the season.
@zvsanders @davidwiers Except Kimbrel’s save chances are going to be way down this year...
@enosarris Matt Murton could have, but his Japanese team made him richer than Croesus IIRC. Wonder if there are others like him.

She drops me off at the bar and picks me up after because we love the heck out of each other.
@CarlosGil83 I’ll go one more: It actively harms your brand by appearing tone deaf.
@johntmeyer No joke, that was in my @UChicago interview. Preceded by “You have angered a vengeful wizard…"
@johntmeyer Oboe. When I’m featured, I can really shine, but I do most of my best work in support of group goals.
@johntmeyer If you were an orchestral instrument, what would you be and what does that say about your personality?
@SethTweets There’s a lot of power in being good-but-not-great. A-Rod, Bonds, McGwire should be all-time legends; Giambi and Pettitte not so
@StephLauren They’re not native, but I think Piquora provides at least some level of analytics for Instagram.
@ajwalsh08 sign me up
@Squawka Aston Villa?
@enosarris Celebrity Jeopardy was good, but you didn’t miss much beyond that.
@FutbolIntellect I love the kit, but it really does underscore just how crap our badge is.
@CompleteArse I look good in baseball caps, which is great, but there is just no way to make them look formal enough for, say, a speech.
@CompleteArse Women have a huge variety of hats they can wear, so it may take a bit to find the style that fits you. It’s a mixed blessing.
@kgib44 They’ll keep coming no matter what, but marking them Not Relevant will make you hate them less. At least in theory...
@CompleteArse Do what I did: Develop a reputation for wearing hats at any and every occasion.
@MikeBerardino @gordofrado The bottom third of that list could, and perhaps should have just been ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@CeeAngi I’ve done more spreadsheets to @isosine’s Mashup Manifesto II than I could possibly count. 
@CeeAngi How do you feel about mashups?
@AnswerDave Psychological torture. The couple has information they want, and they’ve clearly abandoned all morals.
@celebrityhottub That really comes down to who is best at covering their tracks. I guarantee Foxworthy has bodies buried on his property
LRT: @benpopper makes a very good point. Even now Apple Maps are woefully behind and that inspires precious little confidence in me.
@jakenyberg *whispers* If you build it, we will come
@AmeriGunner nope, not a peep. Pretty surprising, actually...
@AmeriGunner thanks! I wanted to be on #SNL40, but the stupid fans voted me to the ASG instead.
@AmeriGunner Nice! I'm sure we have most of them around here. It's one of the upsides of having a brother who is a pastor.
@Swydan @daynperry or, horror of all horrors, he flipped his bat after a long home run. #StoneHim!!
@AmeriGunner I need to read more Lewis. I read a lot of his kid stuff, but too little of his heavier theology.
@daynperry or if he were the Bears QB!
@Swydan it's the 20th percentile!
@Swydan Wayne's World is most definitely my jam.

@Swydan unfollowed, blocked, reported for harassment.
Didn't notice Kanye's grey contacts before, but those things are pretty awesome.
@Stefmara Seriously, was Ashlee Simpson busy??
This is a travesty and a sham and HEY IT'S BETTY WHITE!!
@CompleteArse Absolutely. And no other common language between Gibbs, Kos, Per and Gabriel to fall back on.
@CompleteArse Nope, you’re right. Wenger has brought it up a few times in press conferences, so it must be a real issue.
@Ceetar Yeah, Double Daisy and the 120-min IPA aren’t really that similar at all, but are technically the same style.
@Ceetar I couldn’t be happier about this. DIPAs are a beer that separates the wheat from the chaff, IMO. Plus it’s one of my favorite styles
@larsleafblad Thanks, Lars! It’s great to be home for sure. I’d love to grab coffee with you soon if you’ve got some time.
The Xprize but for keeping my wife upright.
@allenlinton2 since you're a Packer fan, I guess you know all about being overrated... #Oooooo #SickBurn
#hoodooyoulove? @Nefertari224 and @BoomIslandBeer. Individually, of course, but in combination even more so!
I just earned the 'Land of the Free  (Level 24)' badge on @untappd! 
I just earned the 'I Believe in IPA!  (Level 13)' badge on @untappd! 
@AmeriGunner well those aren't *all* for me... But yes, yes we are.
Hoppy Valentines Day! 
@CTrappe @CarlosGil83 @vincenzolandino @TheApparatusMag @adampopescu @RyanAmirault @bobbyisaacson @ChelseaKrost I'm the same way
@rstevens Mine doesn’t fit anymore :(
@larsleafblad Surprised they have so much merchandise just sitting out on the counter. That’s gotta be 10 grand in the frame alone!
@pharmy1917 I am generally pro-chaos, but this is a bridge too far.
Of course Twitter’s notifications would go nuts on a day when I’m waiting for news.
@cjzero Saw him play at Monticello and was SURE he was going to be a stud. Not so much...
@AmeriGunner Not counting the Olympics?
@harrypav @keithlaw @paul_boye Top 5 out-makers last year: Kinsler, Andrus, Pujols, Pence, and Longoria. #AllStarsAcrossTheBoard
@mattlindner If you were repeatedly calling him in a park, people might think you were singing Ignition (Remix)!
@howardmegdal Austria?
@davidwiers Wow, that’s news to me! Link?
So, if I started a blog where I reviewed the mixtapes and other such things I get tweeted, would you read it?
@craigcalcaterra @YahooNews Any word on how ice cream sales did?
@octonion Ryan Theriot, Mike Fontenot...
Damn it, @NightValeRadio, stop producing such excellent merch. I only have one torso! 
@larsleafblad I didn’t know you were into mashups! You should check out @thewhitepanda and @isosine for great new stuff.
@Aisle424 @mike_petriello I can live with that. Anything I think of her featuring in, I cringe at, but I’m sure she was in stuff I liked.
@drewsilv @mike_petriello I saw 1 movie during the time I lived in STL. That wasn’t it.
@mike_petriello she was really good in Extract, not sure I've seen her in anything else. Made SNL almost unwatchable for me.
Rolling Stone’s Best SNL cast list isn’t abysmal, but Wiig at 14 is unforgivable. Target lady was solid, but she was too one-note for me.
@rui_xu Get @SlackHQ
@RDavidK I am as still as a stone 
@RDavidK probably true. On the other hand, there would be no delay in negotiations since I’d already be there!
@MBL_hoya I’m thinking a dirigible gets me close enough to pine, but no one ever thinks to look up!
@MikeFerrinSXM I’m investigating FAA rules for the area. If I’m reading this right, I can just hover above it for as long as I want!
@MBL_hoya Between that and Valentine’s Day, I hope you planned a blow out celebration!
Put in an offer on a house this AM and now all I want to do is sit in front of it looking longingly at it, but apparently that’s “creepy."
@isosine Roses are red
Violets are blue
There’s a rabid raccoon in the basement
@lauraebg Maybe. My list of shows to watch is LONG.
@lauraebg Nope, I’m really a Star Trek noob. Almost done with season 4 of #TNG, plus Nemesis and Wrath of Kahn.
@AmeriGunner She’s like the platonic ideal of bartenders. Woefully underrated.
Random #TNG note: Whoopi Goldberg is really, really good as Guinan.
@mattpuettmann That’s genius. You can stay.
The headshot worked for a while, but I think I found my forever avatar.
@jessgitner and also, weirdly, 538 now.
He said, thickly layering another swath of paint.
The best data work you can do is basically pointillism, using a thousand small points to make one grand image. Too often it’s impressionism
@RandBall @Go963MN If she can stop them from playing the same 9 songs into oblivion, it’ll be a good move.
@QueenKika @mattdpearce @tanehisicoates and realized that it was way more fact than fiction. Broke my mind for a bit.
@QueenKika @mattdpearce For me, it was “Man, what a messed up society that creates a permanent underclass.” Then I read @tanehisicoates...
@drewsilv 
@drewsilv But where will I post my insane borderline racist diatribes????
@jlwoj @JP_Breen No. Do it yourself, your “honor"
@mattdpearce The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas, 24, but it took @tanehisicoates’ Case For Reparations for me to understand what I’d learned
@JP_Breen You’re making me homesick!
@jnmcrms It’s a very interesting field, but you tend to walk away wondering how we haven’t extincted our species yet.
@jnmcrms Poli Sci, but I did most of my later work studying genocide and civil war. Lots of Marxist and quasi-Marxist rebels out there.
@jnmcrms Np! Happy to actually use my degree for once.
@Tepper CRAM IT, DORK.
@jnmcrms Against it. It operates within the means of the system instead of overthrowing it. Keeps ultimate power in ownership’s hands.
@jnmcrms Not as well as I used to, but I can rap. What’s up?
@AmeriGunner I forgot it this morning! I'm desperately unhappy about that. Here's my current beverage photo: 
I haven't tried it yet, but if it stays this cold for much longer, I'm going to! 
@SethTweets @Brandon_Warne @afansview There is definitely something to be said for cheering, booing, and letting the game end when its over
@SethTweets @Brandon_Warne @afansview Out of professionalism if nothing else. But I am nothing if not an idealist in these matters.
@SethTweets @Brandon_Warne @afansview You are, undoubtedly, correct. Still, I would like to think an editor would send that back.
LRT: 
@Brandon_Warne @afansview His editor had better be hog-tied in a closet somewhere. No other excuse for that going to print.
@c_dowley Yeah, that team is going to give up solidly 5 runs a game. They’re gunning for the first pick in the 2016 draft with that rotation
@KeithOlbermann This might be even worse than Chuck’s comments, though in the same vein: 
UT better have KILLER bats MT @jaysonst: All Unemployed Team rotation: Chris Young, Kevin Correia, Roberto Hernandez, Joe Saunders, Zito.
@mike_petriello @keithlaw One of his complaints is that analytics folks have “a bloated salary”? That’s hilarious.
@craigcalcaterra FB will have the same issue. If new publishers pop up and thrive outside their ecosystem, those inside will get noisy.
@craigcalcaterra It’s all about differential, I guess. AOL lost out when the broader web was better than what was inside their wall.
@craigcalcaterra Just like it did for AOL in the 90s, but walled gardens never seem to hold up for long.
@JDSussman @dschoenfield I disagree, but given how bad the Phillies and possibly Braves are going to be, it’s not impossible.
@injuryexpert Sleep Muy Thai?
I’m desperately hoping this isn’t altered in any way and the Twins are having a “Celebrate Cubism!” night 
@Stefmara Your odds of winning are now only slightly lower than they would have been if you had bought one.
If there were a physical embodiment of Excel, how much would you pay to hit it with a baseball bat? I’m in for a solid $50 $MSFT
@sporer @enosarris Watching Neshek dominate again was probably my favorite part of the 2014 season. He was so much fun to watch.
@paddypower Wow, no odds on Fabio Capello? Can’t imagine he’s loving life in Russia right now...
@mattlindner Nah, it’s not too often. It’s just funny to me to be on the other side of it.
@Heisenbergkamp The Russian FA can barely pay Capello, so I’m sure they’d be willing to let him go back to England if AV wanted him.
@mattlindner Now that I am in PR, I am tempted to sit you down with many beers and learn what makes a press release remotely acceptable.
@jakenyberg Happy birthday, hombre!
@jonahkeri would you say it's more <FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE> or <HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL><HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL><HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL><HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL><HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL><HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL><HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL><HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL>?
@jonahkeri When is your mixtape coming out?
@arsenaloFka He’s an inspiration to us all.
Great first time at @1millioncups this morning! Thanks to @johntmeyer for the impetus to check it out.
@jessespector Why isn’t it legal to shoot people who don’t use Oxford commas?
@amandarykoff well until today, they had scored the same number of goals this season!
@Chicago2Chelsea They looked up for it today, but a healthy Liverpool is a tough side to beat. Doubly so at Anfield.
Times I’ve begrudgingly bet on Sp*rs to win: 2. Points taken by Sp*rs in those games: 0.
Throwing an afternoon signal boost on this: 
@simonbrundish and Lamela as well, who looks ABYSMAL every time I watch him.
Glad for the win, still unimpressed with the result. #AFC
@Chris_Cwik Are you huffing paint again?
@djshort @TheFantasyFix TBH the issue is that I’m so far behind on TV that it was hard to devote the time to it. Still true, but I’m closer
@TheFantasyFix @djshort Are you honestly going to argue that season one is good, enjoyable television? I’m actively rooting for the DEA!
@geoffreymoore @djshort But it’s SO BAD so far...
@BLarsenAFC1886 No, no, no, he’s nicking a living and terrible, remember?
@A_W_Gordon Can’t wait till they sell him to Madrid!
@djshort If I watched exactly .5 seasons of Breaking Bad, will I understand Better Call Saul at all?
@holly_holl Short answer is that there are tournaments within the season, so you have 3-4 sets of games that have to played at once.
Congrats to @Mobute on doxxing the entire state of Florida! 
Entered one of the new Amazon Giveaways. It’s a pretty seamless system, but man I’d like to understand how their winner generation works...
@jessespector Your food opinions are bad and you should feel bad. (Love of Dairy Queen aside, that’s entirely acceptable)
@ddocket Mine’s next week, but I sort of doubt Dwyane’s going to come through for me. We’ll find out!
@ddocket you’re a champ! (Happy Birthday, btw!)
The new stuff from @kathryncalder is really, really good: 
@MJ_Baumann At least not until someone has fallen for your schtick and offered you a perversely large contract.
Sleet sucks, that’s a given, but the fact that it sounds like a rain stick in my office right now is pretty awesome. #SilverLining

1) SkyMall is bankrupt <BLACK RIGHTWARDS ARROW>️ 
2) nothing else to do during flights <BLACK RIGHTWARDS ARROW>️ 
3) in-flight magazine…
@Sky_Kalkman Joe Mauer has to be high on the list...
@Chris_Cwik @daynperry I was just about to ask if this was supposed to be a DM. Then I saw the number.
@MikeGianella Couldn’t agree more. I’m so much more prepared for the writing world now than I was when I was in it.
Alternatively, go into PR/Marketing.
Advice for Young Journalists: If you’re taking this seriously, you’ve already lost. Go your own way, own your unique perspective, and hustle
@eveewing Will you chip in for the daring helicopter escape or do I have to pay for the style points myself?
@enosarris Jeff Samardzija?
@SlangsOnSports It might be @Parker_Adderson, in which case he knows full well they’re going to be miserable.
@MikeBatesSBN @jay_jaffe "Oh no, the Fan Plane crashed on Fan Island….it’s MLB’s Lord of the Fans!"
Biggest takeaways from this @MProfsWire article: 1) People still say groovy and 2) no one wants to go to the Midlands. Can’t blame them.
@zvsanders Isn’t Sam Smith one of the better platoon bats out there? Plays in Seattle, I think...
@dbrauer @TwinsGeek IIRC, it comes out to $28 a game minimum. I'm betting I can StubHub my way into those same games for less.
@CompleteArse The ones for birds are awesome! A murder of crows, a parliament of owls...
Holy cow, it was! Well done, Bradley!
Was that an Olimpico from Bradley?!
It’s such a shame the new #USMNT striker doesn’t go full Sean Connery and spell his name ZARDOZ!
@BLarsenAFC1886 Gervinho just chipped the keeper from the halfway line to win it.
@jessespector @mike_petriello @Marc_Normandin Especially if Cashner continues to trend up as Shields begins to fade a bit.
@teen_archer I wear Tevas all the time (need a new pair, actually…). Come at me, Bro. #SandalLife
@amandarykoff Also: an apt description on BJ's last few seasons!
Watching #TNG with @Nefertari224 has been great. Season four has been particularly good so far!
Nothing to be done about it
