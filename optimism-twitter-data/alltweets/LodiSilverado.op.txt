I’m fine with his cloture vote. So why not vote No on the unconstitutional bill, or even abstain? @ChuckNorton1 @mooretommyh @KLSouth

The President has the power to make treaties w/o Congressional review? @KLSouth @mooretommyh @MaydnUSA @peddoc63
No, I’m talking about final passage of the Corker bill. @KLSouth @mooretommyh @MaydnUSA @peddoc63 
Quite so. The 2/3rds requirement with default approval &amp; a weak GOP guarantees Obama’s approvals. @KLSouth @mooretommyh @MaydnUSA @peddoc63
Yes because the conditions of the review are unconstitutional &amp; unnecessary. @KLSouth @mooretommyh @MaydnUSA @peddoc63
To ‘grant’ O a review in exchange for giving him default approval is a loss not a win. @KLSouth @mooretommyh @MaydnUSA @peddoc63
I’m against the premise that O can make such deals w/o review, at all. They’re effective treaties. @KLSouth @mooretommyh @MaydnUSA @peddoc63

<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><THUMBS UP SIGN> @peddoc63 @KLSouth @mooretommyh @MaydnUSA @SenTomCotton

Muslims don’t just hate America. They hate every non-Muslim nation. Been that way 1,400 yrs since Mohamed said KILL! 

Liberal voters are slaves to Progressivism!
