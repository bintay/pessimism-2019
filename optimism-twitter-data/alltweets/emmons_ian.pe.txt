Or not...
I hate my life right now, can I just be done already?
Bedtime for me.
I just want today to be over. #done
I'm pretty sure I reserve the right to be mean when I feel like it.
Not really in the mood for anything today.
Finally got my butt out of bed lol
I can't think of a way that I would have rather spent my night &lt;3
On my way to SOM and I slip and fall on my face. What a wonderful way to start my day.
50 mins to go...
Can't sleep.
Finals week in a nutshell 
It's a sitting back, relaxing, and listening to music kind of day :)
Today has been such a good day so far and I can't wait for tonight! #AvengersAgeOfUltron
I seriously have the best girlfriend in the world :) Seeing her face never ceases to brighten my day &lt;3
I feel so much better after I cried it out this morning. I can finally get on with the rest of the school year without these stupid emotions
@spinkbri was never an issue for me.
A little Ray Charles to cheer me up :) #georgiaonmymind
I'm literally nauseated from sleep deprivation.
Netflix made me do it. #AllNighter
House is just too good to go to bed
Today is going to be a lovely day :)
My insomnia is getting really bad these days.
Well, that was fun.

Tonight turned out to be pretty amazing ;)

What is that sleep thing again?
I can't sleep because the rain is so loud against the windows.
Hey babe, I know you'll see this in the next couple of minutes ;) I just wanted to say I love you &lt;3
Well, that was interesting.
I can't sleep, but only because my reality is better than any dream! :) I love you @leighbeah17 &lt;3
Even though it started off bad, today has been a good day :)
I just want to do something right for once...
I'm tired of this whole 'life' thing. I just want a break from reality some days...
@leighbeah17 and they did :)
I love how we always seem to get through anything when we know that we will always have each other :) &lt;3
Just rewatched the highlights of the Wisconsin Arizona Game. The Badgers completely ripped apart the Wildcats. #BustedBracket
Why did I do that? :/
Oops...
bbrs.
@spinkbri 
I hate this.
Oops...lol
Your geography should not dictate your theology #MIHYC14
I've had the most amazing night with the girl of my dreams &lt;3 #trulyblessed
I burnt myself on the fire I was using to sanitize my water #thirdworldproblems
@Lisa55Fal or i really hate the person.

Last night could not have been more perfect, all thanks to my wonderfully amazing girlfriend!  I absolutely cannot wait to see her again!!!!
