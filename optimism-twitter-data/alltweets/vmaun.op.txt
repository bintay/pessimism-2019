@RiotJonStein 
Kael’thas purchased with gold! I love adding to my collection even if I don't use him much!
Got my boss the first 6-issue of "The Boys". He's loving it. @questionitall
@KLeCrone if it is, I'm sure @Daredevil would love to see it!
Growing up, there was only one Game company I would have begged to work for: Blizzard. #Truestory. Live your dreams too. @BlizzardCareers
@KrashyTV hahhaa that too. Ok ok, so the Pats have Superman (Brady) and The Atom.
I wish I could go back to my 20yr old self and point to @BlizzHeroes and say: gaming DOES get better. Woulda made my life easier.
@Wyattearp1989 @BeShuster I could listen to the smooth stylings of the Blake all day long.
Holy shit. I didn't know Superman was on the Patriots! (No, not Tom Brady). 
@jaymzrstee Can't wait to see more.
@2ARCChubbsZ @BlizzHeroes I shall joint shortly
@FourCourtJester @CyaSteve @2ARCQuibsY @iamMiava awesome. Thanks all!
@FourCourtJester @2ARCQuibsY @iamMiava   Lol thx. Difference between spectator and referee in custom match in Heroes?
@iamMiava explain something to me?
@2ARCChubbsZ @2ARCGaming grats guys. Great game 2
Imagine how flummoxed Pats-haters are going to be if they end up winning the Super Bowl again anyway.
I think 97% of NFL fandom are happy any sort of ruling happened. The other 3% are Pats fans.

@SchAmToo that's awesome!



Ah, I was just shirk with $75k. "Fully-Functional TRON Lightcycle Sold For $77,000" 
@MeggieMay13 haha. It's so easy to stop and watch if you're just flipping channels!
I'm sorry, did you say your name is 'Shiloh'?
@jaugustine ah! You didn't miss much!
@ktjnwow crap, and how I want to buy it on steam, and then stream it while I play. It would be fun to get freaked out front of everyone
@ktjnwow sounds good! Thx
@2ARCTraitorr thanks dude. Maybe I can get someone to play it on an iOS device and shoot it to my TV.
@Crosis86 many different factors, but it's not a bad thing in your case. We eventually send at least an email even if rejected.
@ktjnwow guess I need to buy it next Friday night rhen
Anyone play Five Nights at Freddy's? Yay or nay?

@SKELPedroParka hi sorry I think I passed out a bit earlier than this. GLHF!
@SKELPedroParka that is always an unpleasant experience. Sorry.
Talked to a friend and they reassured me that I wasn't crazy for thinking someone had ulterior motives for talking to me after an absence.
@frenone @Poiekelsatin colors so good
@SKELPedroParka GL!
@jaugustine all good man. You didn't miss anything!
@Five_foot_3 too late! I did.!...... ...:P......................................................................
Thanks for joining me. I had fun embarrassing myself!
Streaming @BlizzHeroes with some randos. Join me?
@sanchwow Oh man. If only!
@sagethethird thats #winning
I need a 24hr cigar shop.
@skrutsick wow. Very well done photos.
@NYKevinQuinn how was your night? Whatcha up to tonight!
@NYKevinQuinn not bad! 3-1 in serious matches. Our team was on!
@Inimicalgg my motto is: I have nothing original to say, let everyone else speak for me.
@Inimicalgg that's seriously weird.
@RobertAWing @kieutiepie lol. Wherever Kieu goes, she wins.
@Inimicalgg sorry Bruh. It wasn't meant to be.
@VICE has Florida always been UAE?
You know, when @SenileDonDraper follows you, you really have nothing else to aspire to. Maybe @Doritos. Always @Doritos.
@devolore time to send that to @_youhadonejob
@UnemployedShaku sure man. I'll try to get not without the glare of the water.
Named our Black&amp;Orange koi: Ninja
@cydereal @jfield heh. I know. I'm gonna drink before I get there.
@cydereal @jfield BYOB
@jfield @cydereal really unsure at this point. Playing it by ear.
Five Nights at Freddy's creator gets a subpoena to find out who ripped off his game 
@Noxychu @PezRadar @reedtimmerTVN ouch
All I can say
Is that my life is pretty plain
I like watchin' the puddles…
@ktjnwow very cool. You gonna dyi?
@KonasKorner I don't like pointing out when people are wrong
@fenrysk why not?
@reedtimmerTVN @Noxychu woah. @PezRadar
@cydereal @jfield I'm gonna try to stop by later tonight to check it out. See you there!
@BrettAtkinson haha. Believe me the novelty lasts awhile.
@2ARCPhakz @PezRadar west coast=best coast
@PezRadar yea you shall!
@DiscoPriest @GordonHughes good to hear!
@ktjnwow @PrincessParley haha. I totally want a fire pit.
@KonasKorner yea dude. I think tonight would be good for wine and a cigar!
@ktjnwow very cool! Grats! That sounds like fun.
@ktjnwow totally! The planters weren't cheap but they have a nice technology. Let me know if you want to check out where we bought it from.
@BrettAtkinson @GarrettArt @BlizzHeroes helps me sabotage @PezRadar
@kierpanda secondary unplanned benefit!
@GarrettArt @BrettAtkinson the future is nigh!
@gopherstick @DorothyTu @BlizzardCareers @Catastrophye I've always wanted to be a test subject!
@lockrocks80 you and I both! Or Hearthstone.
@BrettAtkinson I have relatively low and reasonable expectations, so yes. I'm not expecting 14day battery life, Hearthstone and holography.
@jfield @Rischerion @Noxychu @DorothyTu @BlizzardCareers swag
@Lugia_Blizz @DorothyTu Blizzard IT
@lockrocks80 :-)
@DorothyTu @BlizzardCareers @Catastrophye haha. Come on over!
@PezRadar @nairmak_gren what he said
@ktjnwow thank you. Makes me feel better about the purchase!
@MethyleneGaming exactly. It's an accessory and a companion device. May be more in the future but good for now.
@voxdotcom hmm. Boston is much more prominent here than I expected.
@DorothyTu @BlizzardCareers you should do Recruitment for a day. We sit you in front of Taleo for 8hrs straight. @Catastrophye
@DorothyTu @BlizzardCareers ok I need to do this.
It's easy to get used to glancing at the Apple Watch. I haven't worn a watch in 15 years so I don't have habits to break.
@Bulidar @jedsblog she could still be my boss.
@miyata_kurisu thanks dude. Gotta live up living in SoCal!
@Phenteo totally do it! Light, comfy, not too expensive! Let me know if you want to use the place I got them from.
@englishguy Jelly of the doughnuts
New couches. Just add sangria, steaks and music and I've got a party! 
@2ARCPhakz @day9tv I think he'd take you up on it. He's a nice dude.
@Rykoshet oh man that's be cool. He's the coolest of the cool.
@Broximar ah shit. You're right. Nat all the way. I still like her now.
So apparently celebrities and athletes taking randos to prom is a big thing now. At that time in my life I woulda hoped for Claire Danes.
Damn you, The Office. Damn you for making Human Resources so unattractive! :P
@oliviadgrace @devolore Interesting!
@devolore @oliviadgrace is this Irvine you're talking about?
@PezRadar #sorry/notsorry. That was friggin hilarious!
@PezRadar If you ain't trolling your friends in Heroes, you ain't tryin.
"Merry Christmas, bitches." ~me, as Great Father Reghar
@ZV_Equinox haha. I wouldn't mind :P
@2ARCChubbsZ Hah really love Reghar!
@BrianInkrot Yea dud eyou totally should play. Glad to have you on.
@2ARCChubbsZ lol. "NEED MOAR SUPPORTS!"?
@BrianInkrot Blizzard plays Tues/Thurs. You're more than welcome to join!
@UnemployedShaku lol. Lets both hope we get answers.
Hmm 8,400 "steps" and I didn't even play Ultimate today. Does the pedometer seem accurate/inaccurate to Apple Watch owners?
@real_lethality the genre is the least intuitive game. It really takes some determination or a group of fun friends to really ease you in.
@real_lethality remnant of old map mechanic. If you don't like that you'd be appalled at the stuff they cut. Minions are the least of it.
@oliviadgrace nice! Practicing some heroes myself!
I'll see myself out.
"I can't believe what people will throw away." ~ Squirt the Peddler

These are amazing! 
Sent heartbeat to friend w/ Apple Watch, he replied: "Heartbeat freaked me out, I looked at the watch then I died in @BlizzHeroes". Worth.
One shout out for today: #ff @questionitall . He may be twitter-boring, but he's giving me a free lunch if I get him up to 200 followers :P
My boss @questionitall is gonna binge-watch @Daredevil this weekend. It's small things like this that I know I'm working at the right place.
@Sachant good taste in music. Great on a gloomy day.
@purebangBrock dude. I saw this. Feel bad. Jags can't catch a break either.
Finally hope to be getting a bunch of heroes in tonight and this weekend. It's gonna be goood
@Chounicorn need moar cats
@HcOne13 @DdayDrasin seriously. I need to buy everything they announced. Can't wait for crusader!
Was about to sleep but I see my friends @2ARCFuriousD @2ARCMrNyxis are streaming 
@Drothvader I'm so confused. People are idiots.Sundial&gt;Pocketwatch&gt;Wristwatch&gt;Smartwatch&gt;Pocketwatch&gt;Sundial&gt;Punch me in the face.

May as well just use your phone …
@Drothvader Freaking hilarious!
@iamMiava @Fenixsniper @2ARCTraitorr @2ARCPannucci It was a casual conversation on bnet. I gone dun dun it now.
@kvetchup Let's start by deleting the Magazine rack.
Ok, since we're going backwards in time, whats the over/under a 3rd party vendor creates a "pocket-watch" chain for #AppleWatch ?
@2ARCPhakz @2ARCTraitorr LOL. You don't need an invite. You're autoselected.
@2ARCPannucci @2ARCTraitorr You sent one?
@2ARCTraitorr @2ARCPannucci LOL. I don't do large parties. This'll just be us.
OK, as an amateur photographer, the fact I can use an Apple Watch as a wireless remote for the iPhone is INSANELY welcome.
@Anadeius @hitstreak @TEAMEVGA With great power comes great responsibility...
@2ARCPannucci @2ARCTraitorr HAHAH. Shit, didn't expect that to be thrown back in my face... LOl. DM incoming!
@2ARCPannucci @2ARCTraitorr LOl. The power of Bnet Chat. I don't have you on there..... hmm.... ;-)
@kvetchup Honestly, any undeletable app Apple makes kinda annoys me.
Sweet. Me and @2ARCTraitorr are planning to party at Blizzcon this year. It's all coming together...
Rain. We need it. Actually we need 30 more inches over a period of 6 months.
Wow. Hawks swept the Wild. @KonasKorner
@jfield laces out, Jeff!
Need to see if I can get an intercompany American football game going on down here in Irvine.
@BoldKyky let me guess: Nerf guns, bat'leth, assortment of Blizzard 5yr swds, phasers, Han Solos gun, and frostmornes?
@KonasKorner @BlizzGatekeeper looks like a DH?
@KonasKorner @BlizzGatekeeper priorities man, priorities. Smart kid.
@2ARCPhakz @GUNNAROptiks @iamMiava @BlizzHeroes @2ARCGaming My fav gaming eyewear and a deserving Heroes team. This is a joyous occasion.
So sounds like Jimmy Garapolo is stretching on the sidelines.
@GUNNAROptiks @iamMiava @BlizzHeroes @2ARCGaming holy crap! Grats!!!!!!
@AskJoshy gah now I'm hungry
@Leigh5Tom haha. Unpredictable. I don't have a schedule but eventually...soon?
@3030App yay! Thanks!
@3030App Do you have any sights on putting 30/30 on the Apple Watch? I think that'd be more useful to me than Apple's built in stand/sit.
@blizzsteph come to the dark (glazed) side...
@Yaminohere Haha what light is that?
@Epic_Insanity Not yet!
@jfield Nope. 23 for me, 1 for the rest of them :P
Anyone buy an Apple Watch Sport with a pink band and want to swap for my black band? Let me know!
@SolidJakeGG Thanks Jake. You're solid!
@CyaSteve @SolidJakeGG Thanks Matt!
I brought in 2doz Krispy Kreme today. Apparently people love/hate me now.
@SolidJakeGG @BlizzHeroes Is this a old screenshot or live right now?

@CM_Rokcet @michelemorrow sweet setup, bro.
Two words: holy fucking shit. "Tom Hardy Wants To Play Frank Castle In The Next Punisher Movie" 
Went 1-1 with @BlizzardKismet in Heroes tonight but I feel we went 100-0 in fun-factor. Feels good to play games.

h…
@FlyDraenei @KLeCrone you know what's up!
@Frostittute oh that's cool! I hope you like it. I think the middle has been said to be slow, but I thought it built it up nicely. Enjoy!
@oliviadgrace LOL. No apology needed! Keep teh secrets!
@OriginalMrGoat @voxdotcom Where would you put it?
Popped in to say hit to @oliviadgrace when I was in her building today. So happy to hear she loves being at Blizzard!
@oliviadgrace @englishguy @Nyareth Honestly, at some point you can unabashedly say it's just preference. I love paper comics, not electronic
@oliviadgrace @englishguy @Nyareth another entrant to the arena!
@KLeCrone @FlyDraenei Thank you for answering it form me, Kim. I didn't have the heart to.
@kieutiepie @aramisx @PlayOverwatch @MattBeecher1 @prometheanworks @Sico82 @HiNicoleMarie I was not prepared!
@GamerYubi ah nice

#InsideTheNBA
#NBAonTNT #shaqtinafool
#DownGoesShaq #shaqtinafall


@GamerYubi nice. Which show?
@kieutiepie @aramisx @PlayOverwatch @MattBeecher1 @prometheanworks @Sico82 @HiNicoleMarie GAH too many accts to keep a track of!
@aramisx @PlayOverwatch badass. So happy to hear that! @MattBeecher1 @kieutiepie @prometheanworks
When I came for my on-site at Blizzard, I was hopeful and cautiously optimistic. That didn't stop me to ask if they had an on-site gear shop
@arpedrio @StilesVFX Yea you should have!
@cjsampon @TeamTeSPA @ChrisMJK @AdamRosen @TylerRosen firesplorer! Interfox!
@Yuhnsu @emdroid the only time I'd ever agree to pee with 3 other dudes, in that formation. Need a piece of that triforce!
@Abe_Ramos It's a business.
@Kenichan @TeamTeSPA @ChrisMJK @AdamRosen @TylerRosen 
@battlepanda_OR Hmm... at least its clean.
My "e" has been fixed. Thanks @TeamTeSPA! @ChrisMJK @AdamRosen @TylerRosen 
@GarrettArt @BlizzHeroes @KyleFergusson @pixelgarbage @DrmDestryr love it! Very tight!
@cjsampon the fact all it takes is pizza is a thing to celebrate.
@Abe_Ramos I'm at a loss for words.
@nairmak_gren interesting talking about gaming? No. Recruitment at Blizzard? No. Lol :P
@2ARCMrNyxis @iamMiava @2ARCQuibsY gimme some quest bars and I'll learn you!
@AlexZiebart they don't call it the porcelain throne for nothing. It's your only kingdom!
@Abe_Ramos ok honestly, do you even know what you just said? Lol. I'm confused myself!
@jamesgerstner emphasis: minor
@englishguy @Nyareth exactly. It's hard to sway someone who doesn't take it for what it is: a beautiful piece of machinery/fashion.
@bananafreak2u @k_mukai you can. It's called Asian American?
@k_mukai I had a hard time adjusting growing up, myself. Too white to be considered Asian by Asians, not actually white to Whites.
@k_mukai culturally is where it matters, honestly. I shall identify you Asian whenceforth!
@jamesgerstner "these are the Droids, I mean, Apples you're looking for."
@englishguy @Nyareth for the digital-only crowd who view it as a watch first but tech second, it may find a space.
@englishguy @Nyareth it's a weird dichotomy. I haven't worn a watch in 15 years and wouldn't do so. It won't switch horological fans but
@k_mukai I see. It's easy to forget about that (for Dean). Do you self recognize as Asian some/most of the time?
@jamesgerstner truth! I hear it's more resistant to scratches but less to blunt force. The sport is perfect for us.
Had our first Ultimate Frisbee Blizzard team practice today. We "are not prepared!"
@2ARCQuibsY @2ARCMrNyxis @QNGaming has he even seen a frisbee?
@Nyareth well said. I hope to be a little less annoying to people.
@k_mukai lol. It certainly can be. You are???
@jamesgerstner nice! What kind? I'm excited for you!
@SenileDonDraper packs more interest in one tweet than the whole series of Mad Men for me.
@k_mukai that's cool you called him Asian. Usual the "one drop rule" overrules.
Was at the post office. Saw 25 people, only 5 wearing watches. Let's see if that changes in 2 years.
@PrincessParley what is that?

Kael’thas Reddit Q&amp;A on May 12th &gt; 
@2ARCMrNyxis @QNGaming @QuestNutrition you better be healthier next time I see you

FAV = Peasant (WarCraft) 
@KLeCrone You got those from the blizz library? Those are teh hottness!
@2ARCChubbsZ @iBonesTV @QuestNutrition @ESLHeroes @QNGaming Dude. I need to get a box of them before my Blizz v Riot Ultimate Frisbee game.
Sounds fun :] Gl! #TeamBlizz
@silvertongue0 @Postsemreh @Warcraft @AngryOrc1 ah I'm sorry to hear that. He was always really positive.
@rayne_brandt Naah it's just a company to company affair. Thanks though!
 hurts. T_T
@FrojoHotS thanks! Good luck!
@Nerdiant lol thanks but we are ok!
@silvertongue0 @Postsemreh @Warcraft @AngryOrc1 you're not being serious, right?
@Inimicalgg interesting.
@cuppy you and me both!
@RiotJonStein sounds legit
@battlepanda_OR @sooTsi ultimate frisbee match!
@sooTsi thanks!
@dawnbreaker09 @2ARCPhakz LOL. You're there! I'll send you the deets.
@RiotBright we have our Riot v. Blizzard Ultimate Frisbee game locked in! Thanks for spreading the word!
@2ARCPhakz @MattMyersJr Winner and loser trophys :D
@CyaSteve Gotta get you over here buddy. I'll give you an invite the Blizzard bi-weekly lunch games.
@Whammo_OpenRaid Thanks!
@rayne_brandt This one will be in Irvine. The next one will be up in SM.
@MattMyersJr @2ARCPhakz Haha. I was thinking about Periscope but too many people are shy so its not gonna fly.
@zerena_hoofs Thanks! We r excite!
I'm happy to announce that I've set up the first #Blizzard v. #Riot Bi-Annual Ultimate Frisbee game. First game: May 17th. #glhf!
@hitstreak @GarveyNYC got me all excited
@Mallusof wasn't specific but realtor made it sound like overall
@PezRadar me too. But I think the average is pretty healthy
@nairmak_gren just 12.999 mil to go!
So currently the most expensive house in Irvine is $13mil. Somehow, I expected it to be higher.
@HcOne13 @djtyrant @sStarbee @BlizzHeroes him on the flying carpet, ftw
I'm just kidding. We are gonna hug it back to health.
1st image: HR copier note

2nd image: as seen, later today (I'm on left). 
@PezRadar @BeShuster Nothing a little Ultimate Frisbee won't cure.
@zerena_hoofs I get it but even as a motorcyclist, I don't really like it. Insanely dicey in most cases.
@misayi that's what I like to hear!

Hi, I'm Philip Rivers and I have Cable. 
@kimaphan @ShihTzuGizmo holy crap. Well done. Gizmo is such a cutie!
@hawkeward let me inspect his Apple Watch. Felt good and Milanese loop was nicer than I expected. Grats dude!

@Cole_Belle you just had a great idea for my weekend
The @BlizzardCareers LinkedIn Group is now an open group! 
@ChrisDohi @kimaphan Chris, please give it some time.
@Anadeius I guess I do don't I? "That look like spit to you? Ah fuck-it". Haha
@CyaSteve lol. I'll never talk about baseball ;-)
@nearlyoutside thanks man. Can't get a pulse on what's going on over there. I do have some American friends that go apeshit over that stuff.
Some people are Royals fanatics but I'm not; Don't care about royal baby. "Someone was lucky to be born to rich parents"? Yea... Well earned
@saladinahmed @Faience @Gingerhazing "they're like bags of sand." ~Andy the 40yr-old -virgin.
@CyaSteve badass! I'll try to remember you when I announce our coming match!
@FlyDraenei Deadshot, Deathstroke, Death, Dead, Dea, De, D, zzzzzz...
@PezRadar grats! Now we need to play again!
@SirLanik lol. I was a recruiter before I even realized!
@Wyattearp1989 don't get your hopes up. I got out of graphic design for a reason!
I'd watch a "New 52 Pre-Liefeld Deathstroke" television show of it was at least as well made as Daredevil.
I'm not a huge Will Smith fan but he's looking pretty awesome as Deadshot.
Back in college, I placed physical flyers around college trying to find people who shared the same music tastes as I. #truestory
I've noticed the variance between gaming tastes is much more narrow than music tastes.
@2ARCPhakz It's not for everyone; they're Britpop.
@2ARCPhakz "Girls &amp; Boys", "Charmless Man" "Song 2", "Coffee &amp; TV", "Out of Time", "Good Song", "Ghost Ship", in chronological order.
@2ARCPhakz Haha. want me to set you up with an "in order" playlist?
@2ARCPhakz Hahah. I don't wanna say it but: it's cus you're young.
@Wyattearp1989 Hahhaha its not that great but it should suffice. I'll be sharing it soon
Was working on my Blizzard Ultimate Frisbee logo too long tonight. Need moar gaming!
From the new Blur album, I'm digging "Ghost Ship", "Thought I was a Spaceman", "Go Out" and "Lonesome Street" most so far.
@PamelaHorton13 @AmeliaTalon @michelemorrow is that all it takes? Here I was thinking it was much more complicated in general...
@chadwingerd in Heroes?
@LexusLopez @lackofrealism @BlizzHeroes @PlayHearthstone @playzombination
@jonesoalltrades Well said. I think with competitive teams though you play with "best player available" and sometimes it's not your friends.


@lasarabande @BlizzardCareers Hi Sara! Mr. @BlizzRaith may be able to give you some tips.
@AniuPishu First you conquered #StormTheDorm , now you conquered the mountain.
I think that's an interesting concept: drafting players into eSports teams <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@sooTsi @tonyjs_ Oooh! I was drafted! I went first overall!
@HardLuckHero @PlayOverwatch see! It's all about dat fun!
@tonyjs_ "you're the best! Around! Nothing's ever gonna keep you down!"
@CyousKin @PlayOverwatch well I hope we make the games that deserve even more of your time!
@2ARCPhakz @2ARCPannucci @PrincessParley that was amazing! Hahah
@CyousKin @PlayOverwatch first.... And only.
@hotted89 @PlayOverwatch dude I think you should! I'd be all over that stream!!!
@2ARCPhakz @PrincessParley @Wyattearp1989 strike two. You don't want to know what comes next!
@MattMyersJr BOOM! That's amazing!
@Wyattearp1989 @PrincessParley Widowmaker is awesome too. They're all awesome!
@2ARCPhakz you're so mysterious
@PrincessParley Nice! Mercy looks awesome!
@2ARCMrNyxis hahaha. Sure. Put me in the team. But I'm sure I'm gonna get squeezed out by better players very very quickly <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@2ARCDecaet @Aware_ProtoHype @2ARCMrNyxis haha. Some people and the power of the anonymity of the intarnet
I love hearing people already say they're going to go pro on @PlayOverwatch even before its in beta. I'm so hyped.
@mstum ah very very cool. Nice comps!
@2ARCDecaet lol. Name dropper.
@swebliss Good strat commentary, humor, personality, or combination of all. But it has to be a game I like watching.
@mstum first Mac?
Holy crap! Homemade blueberry lassi complete with saffron is TEH tits!
@AshleyEsqueda yea it is! It's one of the only shows I anticipate now. Bring on season 2! @Daredevil
@digitalHUGHES what does that even mean?
My favorite Irvine Vietnamese food joint 
@Rumi_Spice wow. This is fantastic. I know where I'm going for my saffron needs now. Thanks!
Glad he said it. Exactly articulated. "Why Are the Star Wars Prequels Hated So Much?" 
@Zoltariel sis on the east coast costs about $800 per kid per month. Here it's about $900. Missouri I think should be less.
@Postsemreh @Warcraft @AngryOrc1 what happened. I'm missing something
@Zoltariel it's probably different where you live to where I live though.
@HenryFlapjacks exactly
This is not a joke headline: "Texas Governor Deploys National Guard To Stave Off Obama Takeover" 
@UCLAKerim Dude I did but you sent it on Friday? That day was craycray. Speaking of cray, gj! Your rig was turned up to 11!
Welcome to Dimpus. Can I take your order?
@ZerinaX nice. Asian guys getting some attention. Thanks Christina <WINKING FACE>
So apparently I didn't miss anything. #MayPac They said it all. 
@snurre stellar!
@DiscoPriest wait. Let's cancel. Then I'll really be sure.
@snurre photo? Photo!
"Slide card, enter pin, cash back?, amount ok?" OR one touch with apple pay. The old systems are infuriating.
@ScottPytlik agreed. Who do you think they could have pulled back on effectively? Less on the Hawkeye?
 #HeroesOfTheStorm 
@PezRadar not shabby
@scxrlett dedication
@PezRadar @AskJoshy was considering ordering it but Mayweather is disgusting and can't bring myself to do it. :-(
@AdamRosen @AniuPishu @TylerRosen Did someone say party?
@Esmee_Renfro you're a good mommy!
@I_am_Wake @MarcSOlbertz that's great to hear, Wake! Thanks! @BlizzardCS
@pkollar true. I also am very impressed with Whedons ability to juggle ALL those characters. Basically 13 in all! Amazing!
@BryanRenno sorry. "That escalated quickly". It was the first thing that came to mind though :-(
@Matt_Weiss @Kithrak_ ok I need to make it down there then!
@melthefishy @Kithrak_ right next to Blizzard, in Quail Hill. Remind me when you're here.
@BryanRenno o: if Mayweather wins, goes on to fight a woman. If Pacquiao wins, gay marriage.
@Kithrak_ honestly I haven't seen too many Indian places here but yes, there are better. Mostly not in SoCal though ;-)
@Kithrak_ I like that joint. Not amazing but solid on a needs-basis
@holinka @prometheanworks to further character building, relationships, teamwork, and a much more interesting antagonist.
@holinka @prometheanworks pretty much agree. Cap2 was great. A2 was better than 1 bc it didn't have to do introductions and went straint
@Kithrak_ quail hill, eh? Bunch of a-holes ;-P
@GreekTheatreLA holy crap. I may have to go!
@zerena_hoofs lol. That too. I just think the industrial design is hideous <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
I'm really intrigued by this @solarcity and @TeslaMotors PowerWall combo. The PowerWall was a lot less than I anticipated.
@PrincessParley have fun today
@zerena_hoofs lol. Cus they're so ugly?
Only one #ff today: @questionitall . I can't guarantee he'll tweet out a lot but when he does, I'm sure it'll be interesting.
@oliviadgrace hope it looks good. Only 2 films have been worth being in 3D IMO: Avatar and Gravity. And I disliked Avatar
Nice write up about #stormthedorm "What Heroes of the Dorm Means For Blizzard And Esports" 
How a Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft Card is Made 
With the drafting of Shane Ray, NFL confirms Michael Sam is target of homophobia 
@battlepanda_OR @RobertAWing it's invisible isn't it?
@FourCourtJester rough man. Rough.
@PandaJigu grats at #StormTheDorm ! That was exciting. Grats on the tuition money too!
@BeShuster nice!
@BeShuster what games?
@ChrisDohi GL!
@Indie_Intern there it is
Rich get richer: Pats get the DT from Texas.
@craigmedy agreed. Gurley I'd be ok with. But I still think a 2nd or 3rd rounder would have been better. Ah well.
@ChrisDohi yea go for it
@craigmedy yea man. I agree. I don't think he's gonna be bad but I hate 1st round rbs AND trading up to get them is even worse. Ugh.
@craigmedy who do you think they were afraid of grabbing Gordon that we had to move up?
@craigmedy completely forgot about Hester! Then again so did the NFL.
@craigmedy PREACH!
@qevo sorry bro, that was probably dagger to the heart. My bad. That said I had high hopes for Montee Ball as well!
@KonasKorner @BlizzHeroes @BlizzGatekeeper @PezRadar sweet! Lucky dude!
@KonasKorner @BlizzHeroes @BlizzGatekeeper @PezRadar ha ha! That's amazing!
I really really really hope I'm wrong, because I want the Chargers to do well. I don't mind being wrong.
And from Wisconsin! It's like picking running back from Alabama!
As I tweeted out earlier, how many running backs are picked in the first round and stay with the original team and win the Super Bowl?
@purebangBrock OMG. On a running back! GROSSSS
Dang. A lot of good OLinemen going before the Chargers' pick. Trade down @Chargers , trade down!
@nfl Imagine how much ahead Rivers would be compared to Roethlesberger and Manning if he didn't sit those few years.
@DraftCountdown shots fired! SHOTS FIRED!
Danny Sheltons hair makes me feel inadequate. #NFLDraft2015

@UTgehlken good. They can pick up a good receiver in the second round, better value.
@XTRA1360 not Gordon. OLine.
@purebangBrock at least he'd bring some excitement... And pornstars. Or is it hookers?

#anythingspossible
@purebangBrock hahaha. Johnny calls Browns staff, asks to be drafted, is drafted again. Hilarious.
Revisionist history: Browns win 2 more games last year if they never drafted Manziel. Their QB was more inspiring to their players.
@eunicechen @RiotJonStein sweet. Stalk-city!
Browns are on the clock. Wonder which player SMS's the coaches there with "let's wreck this league" and promptly gets drafted #NFLDraft2015
@purebangBrock totally. I wish I had some beer.

Bout ready to find something to play instead.
I bet the Vikings are late with their pick and someone behind them puts in.
I was wrong. This has been a boring draft so far lol.
@eunicechen that's pretty cool! Have fun!
@Abe_Ramos Jets got him. Wow.
@Abe_Ramos Cooper is legit. Carr is lucky.
@Abe_Ramos Let's see what your team does!
Now shit is gonna get cray crazy in the #NFLDraft2015
@nuggsftw yea. It was enjoyable!
Browns should see if Kevin Costner is free. He may work his magic to get Mariota, Gurley and Fowler whilst only giving up three 2nd rounders
I think this is gonna be one of the zaniest #NFLDraft 's in awhile.
@ChrisDohi What would those attachments be? And you can if you have enough space (5 docs max)
@2ARCPhakz @2ARCGaming @QNGaming @QuestNutrition Grats guys! You've been working hard and you deserve it! Time for some bubbly!
I wanna watch the Pacquiao/Mayweather...

Ice Bucket Challenge :D 
@2ARCPhakz Fun fact: fasted kid, 5'7" Asian dude, on my football team in '07 went to HS with Mendenhall. Said Mendenhal was faster than him.
@purebangBrock And Reggie Bush never lived up to the hype or maybe he was ahead of his time.
@purebangBrock Thanks! That's what I saw too. So I'm just thinking that a hott-shit RB isn't always necessary to win the big one.
@2ARCPhakz I'm not seeing Mendenhall on that final roster. 
NFL Fans: Who was the last RB to be drafted in the 1st round to win the SB with the team that drafted them?
@purebangBrock good pt. SEC is like a league on its own!

Just a fan, will watch about any…
@Indie_Intern they are the Andrew Luck caliber to just throw in there, and Winston is way immature and dangerous. I'm too scared to trade ;)
@Indie_Intern I'm not really sold on either QBs but the main issue is they have no one for a new QB to learn from/under. I don't think
@Alenynn did you have fun?
@Alenynn it was awesome. I'm so pumped, just like I get pumped after blizzcon!
@purebangBrock yea exactly. So it'll be interesting if they get anything done.
@sqwarlock it's interesting. It sounds calculated on their part though.

This is what they all look like. #NFLDraft 
They're the LA Fitness of Japan? Wat? "What is happening at Konami?" 
@History_Pics I'm not a Coke fan but I can appreciate industrial design beauty.
@purebangBrock yea dude. I'm really hyped. Unfortunately SoCal isn't a huge/devoted college football area so you gradually lose interest.
@purebangBrock so you're UMD fan or just a college Fb fan in general?
@Indie_Intern absolutely, unequivocally.
@purebangBrock exactly. Has everyone forgotten how beat up Rivers got by the EOY already? Good value for 2nd rd RB this year.
I'm hoping the @Chargers trade back twice in the first round, pick up a few 2nd and 3rd'rs, get an OT/OG and a 2nd rd RB.
@skydrop411 thank you! Will do!
It's a minor thing but @Twitter has taken away the little orange icon denoting that a tweet is sponsored. Harder for me to block.
@FourCourtJester @BlizzHeroes Baller
@fenrysk Naah have more pressing matters. I may try to get to that later, if I ever get more serious about streaming ;-)
@christophowa Well put! That's why we need great Tools Engineers!
@fenrysk The struggle is real! I used to be able to do 300apm in Illustrator but I'm down to Stone-League with Inkscape!
I'm having a real hard time using Inkscape. Can't tell if its muscle memory left over from Illustrator or PC or its a combination. UGH.
@SKELPedroParka #firstworldproheroesplayersproblems
@SKELPedroParka this is one competition I'm ok with losing! We all win!
@UnemployedShaku @Daredevil Nice! "Shit just got real" ~Hot Fuzz
Start up the bnet client and see 11 people playing @BlizzHeroes . Shazam, I say. SHAZAM!
@Aware_ProtoHype I don't always go deep, but when I do, it involves comic books. @Daredevil
@UnemployedShaku @Daredevil absolutely. Best of both world. But the season was like one epic movie.
@Aware_ProtoHype it was tough, but I owed it to @Daredevil . He waited all those years for justice. Had to show restraint myself.
@skydrop411 With the water crisis in CA, I want to install water-friendly grass. Any possibility of zone-day-specific scheduling 4 Skydrop?
I took my time and resisted the urge to binge-watch @Daredevil. It was totally worth it. I'm supremely impressed with the pacing&amp;production
@cericneesh @BlizzardCareers Hi Kris! I've sent you a DM! I love hearing from Blizzard fans!
@BlizzGatekeeper @KonasKorner oh totally! I'm going to have to cycle them, one night a week and randomize the remaining day!
@PezRadar @KonasKorner @BlizzGatekeeper Well.... reintroductions aren't a bad thing... right? :P
@PezRadar @KonasKorner @BlizzGatekeeper Haha. Kona, Adam, Adam, Kona. Adam and I wreck face in Heroes, WoW, D3 together! You should join!
@KonasKorner @BlizzGatekeeper @BlizzHeroes LOL. Time for poppa to build son a com'puter!
@KonasKorner @BlizzGatekeeper That's so awesome! You're a good dad!
Just bumped into @kieutiepie and she told me my enthusiasm for @Daredevil made her drop everything and binge watch all 13 episodes lol.
@TheStickypeanut @Daredevil Agreed! I'm so touched!
Training hard to be Matt Murdocks sidekick. Thanks @Daredevil ! 
@sushigeisha that is fantastic! My work is done.
@TimMoreels that's the plan! But by that point, I may need a "Gandalf Staff" to keep me upright!
#Blizzard 25-yr Service Award Idea from me: Hauberk with Chain Mail Cape.
@jonesoalltrades Oh so true!
@jonesoalltrades Must say there are at least 10 better ones though :(
@jedsblog if it was on there, would you 'know'? <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
I know you're all wondering what my top 10 comic book films are. I need to compile the list.
@FlyDraenei The next generation is in for a world of pain!
@PezRadar Ooh la la
@Kenichan LOL. Those chopsticks were not made for the faint of... hand-grippage.
First time in forever I've used a pen to draw something. This is what it must be like for people to lift weights in forever. #handcramps
@coL_Trummel @Inimicalgg That's just disgusting
@Silirrion Honestly, of all the leet-speek and acronyms we've come up with, GG is probably my favorite.
@HeroTsukii @Cloud9gg keep up the good work!
@2ARCGaming @Cloud9gg GG!
@VICEGaming hmm they changed the title of the tweet and actually added the go-live date. Interesting.
@jacquelinesg @FourCourtJester once a month is pretty good!
@KonasKorner you and me both, buddy!
@KonasKorner @BlizzHeroes @BlizzGatekeeper this is a very very good thing. So awesome you're digging it!

OOOH. The re-cast of the Final between #ASU and #berkeley  JUST started! 
@Daredevil THIS 
Hell hath no fury like a gamer scorned
@VICE Interesting take.
@lockrocks80 @Grubber Thanks Theresa!
Please follow a person that is an inspiration to always be strong and find those #silverlinings (and also a huge #blizzard fan), @Grubber
Reminder if you want to watch the #StormTheDorm Re-Broadcast, it's on Twitch! @BlizzHeroes

@andrewdavis that's awesome to hear. Hope he is competing for Heroes scholarships in the future and a lifetime fan!
@andrewdavis Know of any Level 100 Goblin Tools Engineers? ;-) 
@andrewdavis How did you and your son enjoy the event?
The Largest For-Profit College Shutdown In History 
Video Gamers Have Better Connected Brains 
@PabloTorre it's better but it's much more complicated than any sport. Ball meet hoop? Here there are dozens of things to consider.
@CantHealz probably isn't unless it's a great dslr with an awesome lens. But even when you do, it's a lot of gear to lug around.
#BeEPIC
@Grubber @BlizzardCS @AmericasArmy glad to have you visit!
@Jackster006 Not bad. Mine: 
@sanchwow somewhat agree. There is a low physical barrier to entry thus more equal. Both take an inordinate about of training/determination.
@setosora I'll consider it a win when she goes "oh, I don't play but I know so many other people who do that it must be worthwhile."
@zeroethic @Trikslyr that's baller!
Plus, sports fans shouldn't really be talking: There are undeniably great people who are fans but a whole boatload of assholes/losers too.
I think in time, videogames will be so ubiquitous, successful and undeniably part of mainstream, all this initial hating will die off.
@CyousKin seriously
@CyousKin distain for Baseball, I really shouldn't hate on it so much. This Cowerd guy is a know instigator/entertainer so I don't take him
@CyousKin honestly it doesn't bother me too much. I enjoy these alternate sports/competitions for what they are. And despite my noted past
@tylerthompson23 Please tell me you're hooked? You can download and play it for free, and enjoy it yourself, soon! #StormTheDorm
@G_Garno It's hard to understand for the uninitated but it's massively fun. Glad you enjoyed it! #StormTheDorm
@G_Garno This was an amazing tweet. Thank you! @BlizzHeroes
@Corey_ADoomTR Glad you enjoyed! It was a fantastic match. And it's a fun game too! You can check it out for free, soon! #stormthedorm
@CyaSteve ah Naah. Was listening to podcast with the director of Punisher War Zone. But good catch!
@Krostron4 Watching football is great but playing is even better. Maybe check out the game, @blizzheroes, for yourself too? :-)
@CamCox12 Glad you watched and hope you enjoyed it! I'm sure someone would be able to give you access to try it yourself! #StormTheDorm
It's not for everyone but Punisher War Zone is still one of my fav comic book movies. See it if you have the opportunity.
Relistening to the @HDTGM episode with @Lexialex regarding the making of Punisher War Zone. What a sharp, smart and hilarious person!
@GamerYubi don't think that has been said yet
@jaugustine if we do I'll let you know pronto!
@jaugustine and I'm so happy that final was a nail biter! Great "television"!
@jaugustine thanks dude. They did a fantastic job. I'll let them know!
Shrine Security yesterday(whom also worked Dodgers games):
"We like this event. Crowd is no trouble at all. Haven't had to throw anyone out"
I'm guilty of this. "For Movies, Twitter Users Are A Key Audience" 
People are freaking out because ESPN televised eSports 
@AniuPishu great job Ania! We are so lucky to have you as a part odor eSports team! Great job all!

not because of espn2 

but because of the shifting interest in media and what the newer genera…

I'm honored but I really couldn't have done it without the support of my team <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
Apparently I was nominated by @Blizz_kathyz and other TA members for "Most Worthy to Skip Work Today" for my contributions at #StormTheDorm

@eunicechen Hahaha. You're right; I'm pretty boring when I'm working!
@peglegchia QQ :(
@eunicechen Thats great to hear! I sure hope so! Awesome meeting you finally (for the second time) too! Thanks for chatting!
Again, like I said before: #stormthedorm was the only playoffs worth watching this weekend. (Yes, even over Hockey for me. Sorry Blues!)
One co-worker asked management at Red Robin to change it to ESPN2 during dinner. This could be a thing now. #stormthedorm
Grabbed breakfast with 5 other HR folks and the whole time we talked about how awesome #stormthedorm was. Monday's have new meanings.
@2ARCMrNyxis @jaymzrstee crap just missed it.
I've been to NFL/NBA/NHL/MLB, college football/basketball games and #StormTheDorm easily was on par with the excitement and competition.
@Kotank64 Kyle. Thank you and ASU for the fantastic matches. We are ALL your fans and proud of you.
@SunDevilBK @sanchwow @ASUeSports that's amazing. Thanks you Bill!
I'm a big proponent of physical activity. But when day comes where we say "kids should come inside and play video games too" I'll be happy.
@Blizzard
#ESPN2

What did we learn? We need more of this.  Much, much more.
Just realized I kept saying "HYPE" about #StormTheDorm... And it certainly lived up to it. Thank you @BlizzHeroes !
@kimaphan @BlizzHeroes @STLouisRams ha hahhaa.  That's TEH HOTTNESS!

@Elvinelol it's sad to feel it's gone. Lost to the ether. But I'm sure it wasn't a pleasant place in the first place.
When people are like "you're working on the weekend?", I'm like: "I'd be here anyway!" #StormTheDorm @BlizzHeroes
In a little more than 12hrs I will be working at #StormTheDorm dorm, being a part of history, meeting awesome peeps and watching the games!

A @PezRadar has appeared! 
@PamelaHorton13 @BeShuster @BlizzHeroes @AmeliaTalon Now, I ain't sayin that's true... but I ain't sayin its untrue. ;-)
"We got a kill!" ~@mikemetcalf hahahah.
Wrecked. Ugh.
It's Christmastime! Come see me stream 'Great Father Winter Reghar'! with @mikemetcalf and @_Korlane 
OK. #Periscope has officially piqued my interest. I may use it on Sunday... ;-)
LIVE on #Periscope: Ok, second one now. Testing out the Twitter post.  
@UCLAKerim sweet. Yea it's a solid board. I don't do anything crazy with it but it does have nice bells and whistles. And it's red.
@Kenichan haha. Yea, it does go semi-crazy sometimes!
@Elvinelol it'll come back. Pink is natural.
@UCLAKerim don't sweat it. Doesn't bother me at all!
@UCLAKerim NICE dude. I want to say MSI Z-97?
@Elvinelol Nice dude! I don't even recognize you!
@sanchwow One can only dream.
@miyata_kurisu LOL. Wholly unintentional but yea!
Anyone try @periscopeco yet? I may test it out in a few minutes.

Are you going to make it to #StormTheDorm, @PamelaHorton13 ? @BlizzHeroes
Insanity is constantly checking the status of my Apple Watch order and thinking the ship date will magically shrink.
I'd be all over this. @Daredevil "Heads Up, Marvel, Charlie Cox Really Wants A Daredevil Movie" 
@qevo @BlizzardCareers dude. Great idea!
At annual checkup:

Doctor: "Smoke?
Me: "No."

Doctor: "Do you drink?"
Me: "Yes. I work at a video game company."

@JadeShyu Truth
#AwkwardGreetsIn5Words
@CyaSteve Permanent buff.
@CyaSteve It's never a bad idea to ask them how they feel to personally know that Val Maun guy. He's the bees knees, or so I hear.
@Max_Dunbar @Sketch_Dailies love it. Intersection of both my hobbies: gaming and comic books!
@YayKaewynn Grats! That's teh hottness!
@Riot_HeadHunter yea saw that. Big news.
@Matt_Weiss unfortunately not yet. I hope to get mine by the time my inter-studio ultimate frisbee game happens though!
@Pallimmanis @Matt_Weiss haha. Yes I did. And I have no raygrets.
@CyaSteve Pakistan. Forgot the name of the city though
Hot Fuzz Is A God Damned Masterpiece 
I found it! 
@GamesBeat @DaleNorth I'll get Runeblade. @hawkeward
@counternotions trick question right?
@_youhadonejob paging @arresteddev
@aramisx @cbtine @PezRadar @shovaen holy crap that's rough. Personally I'd be unable to solo q Jaina with randoms.
@BleacherReport @terrycrews I think it's nice that for after a long time of everyone laughing at him Mike Tyson has people laughing with him
The only championship playoffs that matter this weekend: #StormTheDorm @BlizzHeroes
I love fancy Fridays: I can wear my old "How you doing?" and "What's your name?" and "Wanna grab some dinner and breakfast?", clothes.
@CyaSteve so your code is full of "q,w,e,r, 1,2,3"?
@HogwartsIogic "Not my daughter, you bitch" I think was my fav of the whole series.
@GabrielSassone @ChristinaCoffin me too!
@WhoisJamerson haha. Let you know soon.
@Nerdiant @TaunTaunLover @MeggieMay13 I'm not surprised. They're good people!
Ok. @kimaphan just did a #tbt. She's inspired me to dig up old photos (yet not blackmail-worthy). The hunt starts!
@WhoisJamerson @RiotJonStein you two. You both know I claimed the prize already.
@Evolvyn @BryanRenno that's cool. Good luck!
@NinjaOnPointe @hitstreak SOLD!
@Nerdiant If @TaunTaunLover and @MeggieMay13 follow you, I shall too!
@_Korlane @PezRadar Thank goodness! Best Stitches, EU
@NinjaOnPointe You and @hitstreak should play/come watch and hang out! Beers.... beers as far as the eye can see!
@aramisx @PezRadar @shovaen rough, man. rough!~
@pkollar @Daredevil That's fair. But I believe if you enjoy the first few, it's only going to snowball from there!
@2ARCPhakz @PezRadar LOL. Flexin for those tryouts. @2ARCQuibsY @2ARCMrNyxis @2ARCChubbsZ @2ARCPannucci
@pkollar @Daredevil Great to hear. You're a kindred soul, Phil. Kindred.
@PezRadar @shovaen Totally! I was sad we lost twice but knew we had it in us!!!
Exciting news, I've set up an #UltimateFrisbee match with a studio here in SoCal. I am excited to play with fellow gamers! More to come!
@pkollar Have you been enjoying @Daredevil Phil?

@AlexZiebart what's the verdict?
Got to hang out with 2 of my new hires today: @digitalHUGHES @Matt_Weiss !
@CyaSteve @_Korlane @overlord_bunny Television isn't real life!
@Avaltor05 Someone say shots?
@followgrubby the dream is over!
And professionalism does not = "not fun". It just means you respect yourself and others around you to make stuff happen. We still have fun.
@followgrubby Hahah. It happens. But hopefully the pho will happen one of these years!
@_Korlane @overlord_bunny Hit the nail on the head, buddy
@MeggieMay13 @mike_nassar Blues clues! I mean, best crew!
@_Korlane @overlord_bunny that, the culture/fabric of what we do comes apart. And that's when I'll leave. But I don't fear that happening.
@_Korlane @overlord_bunny The do it because the care about the product, the company, the people, the fans. Once you lose sight of (cntd)
@_Korlane @overlord_bunny we strive for when the (inevitible) conflicts happen: you can know someone isn't doing it for their ego; (cntd)
@_Korlane @overlord_bunny to expand, its good to know that there a reason. Its in our mission statements. And that's what (I hope) (cntd)
@_Korlane @overlord_bunny True. But to expound: passion&amp;drive could me "I love games and I strive for excellence" but what for? Yourself?
@cydereal Damn dude. Glad to hear you feel the same way!
@aranyaphoenix "Hell is other... companies?"
@overlord_bunny Canada is awesome. People are awesome. "Some of my best friends are Canadian!"
@VinceFennel Thanks dude. Hair is off the chain!
@sagethethird :D
Always makes me happy to hear these sentiments. Because the perception is "people just play games all the time". Not true, we get shit done.
Another new hire, not from gaming/traditional gamer, said he was impressed with the level of passion and professionalism. @BlizzardCareers
One of the New Hires I met tonight told me he was impressed with how nice and helpful people are at #Blizzard. I said "Yes, thats standard."
@VinceFennel Vince, Vince, Vince: you're a rockstar.
@sagethethird I won't deny that. We choose good people, people you want to be around. They are all awesome.
I have #StormTheDorm shuttle and beer buddies: @MeggieMay13 and @mike_nassar !
@VinceFennel look at untold treasures!
@overlord_bunny that fact is so true!
@2ARCMrNyxis lol!
@Narull still hoping it happens for you man!
@MaekaGaming it's fun. The people enjoy it!
