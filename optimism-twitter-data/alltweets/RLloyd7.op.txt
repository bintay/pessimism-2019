I actually hope Chuka Umunna becomes Labour leader. How helpful will it be for the Lib Dems to have two Tories either side of the house

We're the party of Lloyd George and Beveridge, bring it back

CANNOT believe we've rejected the Mediterranean migrants. What a travesty. So much pissing me off rn
Lib Dems have been calling for PR since their conception, but now UKIP want it, it's getting attention. Somewhat frustrating.
They're seriously a group of creatures that used to live under rocks aren't they
Labour is just a party of Tories with a different history and a better colour. Thats why the Liberals won't be killed off from this election
If anything proves that UKIP is a one man band joke of a party it's that its members "refused Farage's resignation." What an absolute farce.

Paddy Ashdown is the king of salvage and damage limitation. #LibDems #OnlyWayIsUp
@hurstSOPH it's like Man Utd and Gerrard. The others talk about her more than her own supporters
John Swinney arguing with Paddy Ashdown because .. He ... Agrees with him? <CONFOUNDED FACE> #bbcqt
@teabetty53 because they've been either first second or third nationally for a good hundred+ years, and now they're not.. Perhaps
EXACTLY. Well done Paddy. Well put. #LibDems #bbcqt
Wow. People are obsessed with Thatcher aren't they.
@piersmorgan he'd be a very smart choice for a Conservative leader. Not what Labour needs.
This isn't the end of liberalism #LibDems
We'll all rue the day Nick Clegg left government
Genuinely believed the Liberal ground would stay firm. This cannot be acceptable in the face of UKIP's advances. Needed now more than ever.
The Lib Dem MPs will back him to carry on as leader. Clegg will revive the party.
Moment of the night here this Clegg speech. Nail it kid.
Well done everyone. We've just ousted the two best MPs we've had in a century in Simon Hughes and Vince Cable.
@unclegagag I'm not I just I can't I don't know what to say
I'm speechless
I don't like this country anymore
This is outrageous. Absolutely outrageous.
Holy fuck now Cable is gone
@Independent he was MP for Henley
Messy messy election
Things are looking up for the Vale of Clwyd now, but the Liberals have been unfairly battered.
Simon Hughes was a good MP. A really good MP. That's devastating. This is actually heartbreaking.
@LiamSmall94 Thank god for that. 18 years and fuck all for the Vale
@TheRedRag UKIP took all the votes from Labour haha and handed it to the Tories. Rhyl, safe labour territory, voted overwhelmingly for UKIP
The Vale of Clwyd has been a safe labour seat for 18 years and @BBCWalesNews @BBCWales hasn't mentioned the Tory gain. Why??!!!
James Davies. You beauty.
This is politics in action. This is beautiful. Nationwide.
@AndrewMarr9 Vale of Clwyd recount, please mention it! Unbelievable! First gain of the night
@JamesGween that works haha
@lauren_r111 however long a recount takes, we've got it though I think xoxo
@JamesGween hahaha ok?
How can that majority get overturned? Please please just announce so I can rest
@JamesGween calm down dear <SMIRKING FACE>

Come on!! BUZZING FOR THIS
National Coalition is my preferred option.
Andrew Marr has had a stroke, Nick Robinson has had cancer and David Dimbleby is 142. God's trying his hardest but it ain't working.
Tories getting all their votes from Lib Dem voters.
Lib Dems are the most hardworking genuine politicians, such a shame if this trend follows.

@paigeshardlow_ politics in action

SO hope Ed Balls loses his seat
Watching these Lib Dems losing their deposits is like watching someone get battered. It's awful.
Didn't even need to count Sunderland
I don't believe the Lib Dems will be decimated that much for one second

Con: 284
Lab: 263
SNP: 48
Lib Dems: 31
UKIP: 2


Lib Dems will do better than 10. No way will they get under 25.
Hope his exit poll is right (for the Conservatives in government) and wrong (for the Lib Dems not to lose so much)
What the fuck hahahaha I'm completely mixed inside
Imagine not voting because it isnt "cool"
@unclegagag devastated
@LukeJamesAstley you have no idea how unexpected this is
HOLY SHIT! Tories gaining 316, Lib Dems 10
HOLY SHIT
@JoshuAdamJones I think the English language is killing us here haha
@JoshuAdamJones exactly, that's why there's pressure to make people vote and no pressure for people to not vote
@JoshuAdamJones that's because it's easier to not vote than to vote, so you need effort to do something rather than expect it to just happen
Hopefully tonight is the last time we hear from Farage for a very long time <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>üèº
@JoshuAdamJones opinion v opinion
@JoshuAdamJones very few of them id imagine, even Russell Brand buckled and he's made a fortune off it
@JoshuAdamJones difference between not voting and spoiling your ballot is the difference between not giving a shit and consciously rejecting
@JoshuAdamJones oo touchy
@Independent 27-33
@JoshuAdamJones your fault if you don't know what it's all about I'm afraid, until the schools take up that task <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>

As long as the Lib Dems are in government, all fine here. Around here, I want a new MP; if that means Conservative, so be it, bring it on.
@Louhands @charlleedidcote ask a neighbour where you vote, it might be Ty Pendre for you if you live near Gronant Rd, not sure :/
@Louhands @charlleedidcote where will be different depending on where you live, it'll be on your poll card, 7am-10pm 
@Louhands @charlleedidcote always a Thursday la
@charlleedidcote I don't want to be like a party advocate haha Google a quiz of who you should vote for!
@charlleedidcote you leaning one way or another?
@Jay_White3 he's the guy who ruined the economy in the first place Now he wants round two, don't trust him at all. Clegg-Cameron best option
@charlleedidcote 
Thursday can't come any sooner.
@Jay_White3 they'll get two seats max, and Farage won't be representing one of them
@Jay_White3 Miliband has only got one coalition option, and that's with the Liberals- that party has saved the nation haha
@Jay_White3 SNP are a worry too, #fundilymundily disagree with UKIP and SNP, but would rather see SNP in govt than UKIP
@Jay_White3 *even if, not still
@Jay_White3 I've already done a little acca, i want a LibCon coalition, and hope it happens, even if it's still a minority coalition govt
@Jay_White3 there's a reason there's a direct correlation between the BNP support and coverage and the UKIP support and coverage
@Jay_White3 without their leader they are nothing, and Farage won't win his seat. I for one can't wait to see them crash and burn
@Jay_White3 good boy
@Jay_White3 holy shit, you're not voting UKIP are you!? That's their excuse for not getting enough support, that the BBC don't like them
@Jay_White3 it broadcasts all party political broadcasts, better than allowing parties to buy advert space

Not that I'm biased.
"UKIP says things people actually think" No, they say things you actually think you little closet-racist, loony homophobic xenophobe.
How someone can't like Star Wars is beyond me

@SteveStfler she's a Simpson
If he'd have met Clegg, he'd walk away with an endorsement. If he'd have met Cameron, he'd walk away with an endorsement. That's the point.

 
A politician is what they are because they're the best at making people think they arrived at their conclusion on their own. Brand fell 4 it
If he was a politician, he'd be showered in vitriolic hatred for making so much money from his voting indifference and making such a U-turn.
So Russell Brand, who's made his recovered career on telling people not to vote, has endorsed Labour because he met Miliband.

If there was a Tory Liberal Coalition party, I'd vote for that. They've given me and me fam everything these past five years. I owe them.
It's quite obvious that the reason the BNP have gone from fielding 338 candidate in 2010 to 8 in 2015 is because their vote is now for UKIP.

So, Ed Miliband won't be the Prime Minister because he won't make a deal with the SNP. Bad move for him that.
I'll be live tweeting the leaders debates a few hours late. Plan your blocking in advance.

Jesus Christ of course she is. Never thought about that. There's an immigrant on stage, don't let Nigel near, he might sneeze. #BBCDebate
Agree with that. Problem is we need their oil because we won't dig for our own. Green energy would eliminate that tie I suppose. #BBCDebate
@HarriTaylor_ not that I find any difficulty being a minority
@HarriTaylor_ don't care what colour people's skin is, and just because you won't fit in the +50% doesn't mean you're the minority
Vast majority of NATO countries are in the EU. 22 of 28. And 3 of that 6 have been or are candidates to join the EU. Practically the same.
@HarriTaylor_ numbers numbers
I think we should help to house anybody who invests themselves in the country in any way, regardless of nationality. #BBCDebate
Fuck off Nigel. #BBCDebate
Bloody immigrants, coming over here, building all our houses and letting us live in them. Bloody Europe. Bloody. #BBCDebate

Yeah you?

Yeah rubbish innit?

Yeah. 

#BBCDebate 
Ed vs The World; if he just told us what he'd cut, regardless, he'd probably do better than now. #BBCDebate
Shut up Nigel. #BBCDebate
The Progressive Alliance have closed ranks. Ed on the defence. Nobody takes Farage seriously so don't bother with him. #BBCDebate
If we could earn and save money like the Tories and spend it like the Progressive Alliance, we'd be sorted, I'd imagine. #BBCDebate
Well, Nigel. The Lib Dems did it before you. Sorry. #BBCDebate
I could listen to Leanne read my death sentence though and I'd say "thank you" after it #BBCDebate
Cleggers should've been invited. He'd have wiped the floor with these. #BBCDebate
Struggling to be interested in anything Natalie says. I like her party and her policies, but I just can't stay tuned in. #BBCDebate
@rhiannonsenger nothing <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@rhiannonsenger BBC one
@guardian Clegg wasn't invited
I like Leanne, Nicola, Ed, Natalie in that order. I do not like Nigel. #BBCDebate
There's an election debate on. Here's the first warning.
@guardian surely unconstitutional

@Celtes_Cymru an elderly couple vamooshed them. My mate bought him a butty once and he said he didn't like cheese.
Genuinely made me say out loud "what the fuck are they doing" obvs not to them, I'd get battered, but still
I'm actually fucking disgusted. Three Manc kids are stood around a homeless man eating their ice creams staring at him. They're like 15.
You can probably trust the Lib Dems the most out of all the parties; AS IF they'd ever break a promise again after last time.
He thinks he's funny too, this is ridiculous. Somebody arrest this man.
Somebody in Rhyl is actually sporting a blow-dried mullet, timberland boots and double denim and I have no idea what to do or where to look.
@UKLabour now that's very unfair. And incorrect, but more importantly very unfair.
I love lending my expertise in all areas to the Independent's Twitter account. What would they do without me, one dreads to think.
@Independent they'll call him President Clinton, like they do now, luckily it's formal new territory avoided haha
I think I do and always have text around three people regularly.

I hate people who are trying to be so non-racist that they're actually really racist. "Let them vote for their own kind. Can't complain."
@unisontweets what a farce. Comments are those of the members son, not the member. 
@lauren_r111 when he commits though "my heart is stone yet still it trembles" <BROKEN HEART>
@lauren_r111 is it wrong I feel so so bad for Javert ?
@Charles_HRH that's a very american joke
I felt racist and sexist just holding that piece of paper
@RLloyd7 it's @unisontweets By the way. @UKLabour
This disagrees with every fibre of my body. Shouldn't someone be elected for what they believe not how they're born. 
This head transplant is absolutely racking me, if it works, Jesus Christ, sign me up when I'm 80 and my body is fucked, make me a robot one
If the parties keep on taking chunks out of each other we'll end up with no tax and double funding for everything

@JPKDsDad disagree with the principle that you should pay taxes on money earned in another country, which isn't offshore banking.
I hate Louise Mensch and despise everything she says and the way she says it. But that's probably just me being sexist. #bbctw
@JPKDsDad simply disagree
As if the 27 other nations are going to bow down to the UK threatening to leave. We're not superior to them and we'd be stupid to think so.
@JPKDsDad but you should pay tax on money you earn where you earn it nevertheless
@LukeJamesAstley don't be a meanie
@LukeJamesAstley that's alright mate, I'll care for you xx
@LukeJamesAstley completely arsed. Never been more arsed about anything other than who controls my life and chances to succeed mate
If Caroline Lucas was still leader of the Greens, I'd bet my bottom dollar they'd be on par with UKIP's support #bbcqt
Being European is part of my identity, I don't want a vote on it as much as I don't want a vote on my Welsh nationality. #bbcqt

People around here

"Who you voting for?"
"Labour"
"Why?"
"Because I always do. Am I supposed to vote Labour?"

Incumbency factor much.
In the mood now. Unfollow appropriately and re follow in the morning and I won't judge you.
So 20% of people think Farage won, and 20% thought he lost. I think he's a prick either way.
But that's most probably just my liberal bias shining through, blinkers and all
So; Sturgeon, Farage, Cameron, Miliband, Clegg, Wood, Bennett. 
Mine would be; Sturgeon, Clegg, Cameron, Wood, Miliband, Bennett, Farage
Just hate Farage. Hate the man. Hate the Party.

Ooh fucking hell, go on Nick #leadersdebate
Thank God the women were allowed in this debate. Rattled them up.
In a strange turn of events, I agree with Nick.
Farage should be reeling in this debate, but I think he even shook himself up with the AIDS line. #leadersdebate
Personally, immigration is a non-issue that's been hyped up because of the prick in purple having a pint in front of a camera. Unbiased.

I want an #AlcoholLive because it's ruined me and i hate myself for using it
@ash_eccleston is that alright, Paxman? fuck me
@ash_eccleston and tax to the same level of tobacco so you can earn something out of it to put back into the nation's pot so we can grow
@ash_eccleston then regulate so the nation can't be blamed for any instances OF lacing etc and you can add limits and trade policy
@ash_eccleston i'm saying legalise it because we have double standards on cannabis than we do alcohol
@ash_eccleston i've never said that mate
@ash_eccleston it'd be the same sort of regulation to spiking drinks, it puts the establishment in their comfort zone so they'd allow it
@ash_eccleston you don't buy anything like that then, so it's fine isn't it, what are you arguing about?
@ash_eccleston you legalise it and you can start to 'weed out' (lol banter) the dodgy stuff and just allow organic sales and shit
@ash_eccleston different combinations added before sale like coke in white rhino, some pcps have been reported, shit like that
@ash_eccleston that people believe it's cooked like some sort of breaking bad situation, you're nibbling at nothing lad
I swear people argue with me just because I'm me.
@ash_eccleston what nonsense
@ash_eccleston so regulate the seeds then. if it's legal, the production flow is transparent and controllable
@ash_eccleston adding a legal age limit would be regulation for example
Legalise, regulate and tax. Everyone happy. #drugslive
@ash_eccleston regulate the sale and combination of chemicals though can't you?
Saturday is the one that matters

Should have a 7-way debate (all inc. natls), a 5-way debate (inc. Grn + UKIP), a 3-way debate (main) and a head to head between DC and EM
@WESLEYWOODRUFF @shirleykay11 I'm arguing that the fact he has an opinion doesn't make him incapable of broadcasting with neutrality
@WESLEYWOODRUFF @shirleykay11 I know about the bbc bias on scotland and bias for UKIP but it's not for the Tories from Nick Robinson
@Europarl_EN what is 'other'?
@WESLEYWOODRUFF @shirleykay11 government factor most likely.

UKIP worship Thatcher more than Thatcher's own children.
@TroiHowe what is it this time?
When you keep on saying "it's all good, I don't even care," it's quite obvious that you struggle to care about anything more than that. #cbb
@WESLEYWOODRUFF which reporters do you like?

@WESLEYWOODRUFF @shirleykay11 BBC promises to be impartial, as its funded by the people
@shirleykay11 because it's possible to have an opinion and separate it from your career for professionalism
