@Dave_Ust @ResSports sorry Jerry can't come to the phone right now, he's in a meeting with Ray Rice.
@ResSports burn!
Keep rollin' baby

Wasn't even close. Floyd dominated. #MayPac
Leeeeeeet's get ready to rumble! #MichaelBuffer #MayPac
Seriously the worst rendition of the national anthem I've ever heard.... #MayPac
So Jamie fox is butchering the national anthem.... #MayPac
@ResSports that has chip written all over it
@ResSports he's running out of prospects from Oregon
@ResSports I'm watching the live feed at this communion. Don't think you're alone in this
Very happy with this draft for the @nyjets. Made smart decisions, got value, and they haven't reached. Cautiously optimistic. #NFLDraft2015
@ResSports I'm shocked. I understand the guy needs time to learn but he's got s friggin cannon
@ResSports in fairness I was laughing. He just looked at me and told me exactly what a moc was. It got weird
@ResSports was talking to a patient about them today. Guy is from Knoxville. Had a nice laugh at your expense. Thought you should know lol
@ResSports @nyjets he's got a huge arm. Let him learn I think he would end up being a nice starter in the league
@ResSports just like no one knows what a moc is
@ResSports you might think I'm nuts but would like to see the @nyjets snag petty in 3rd
@ResSports real. Comfortable. Jorts
@ResSports odds his still has those shorts
@ResSports I don't know what's worse that or the fact that the son of a Cowboys db who was drafted in '03 is in this draft.
Pleased with what @nyjets have done so far. Gotta finish this draft strong and gotta lock up Mo Wilkerson. #NFLDraft2015 #GangGreen #Jets
"I thought this guy could go as high as 16" -Mel Kiper. Surprise! Mel was wrong. #NFLDraft2015
@therealvohdin @ResSports it's been a bad on call too fellas....
@ResSports get it brotha
If this happens the #Jets will be making one of the biggest mistakes in franchise history.  
@ResSports not in point pleasant they haven't
@ResSports haha. I got you bro
@ResSports I think your avi needs an American flag background and a bald eagle on your left shoulder
@ResSports absolutely. truthfully I wish it was a John Archibald original so #deepthoughtswithjohna would apply
Preach  
@ResSports I want to like this again
@ResSports goooooooooooooooon
@ResSports and thin. #wisdom #deepthoughtswithjohnA
@ResSports goooooooon
@Dave_Ust @ResSports i think the Internet would explode
@ResSports I know! We won't see that at full strength at least 2 years. You know syndergaard is 1 pitch away from tommy john himself
@ResSports every year it's something
@ResSports all infirmary team
@ResSports @Dave_Ust I just heard chip called up Derek Rose to see if he wanted to change sports
@ResSports @Dave_Ust you in essence just lost a starting QB and the 10th overall pick for a piece of glass
BREAKING: Sam Bradford, injured while going from St. Louis to Philly #madeofglass #NFLFreeAgency #Philly #stlouis
@Dave_Ust @ResSports Aaaaand your left kidney
@Dave_Ust @ResSports and your first born child
@Dave_Ust @ResSports we'll take Nick Foles also
@ResSports foles to the jets (along with your first rd pick for the next decade)
@ResSports what the hell is a Moc?
@Dave_Ust @ResSports I've been hoping for Chip to jettison more players. Not cuz I hate philly. More so cuz I love these angry tweets
@ResSports that sound you hear is the price of that 6th overall pick going up
@ResSports “@SportsCenter: BREAKING: Eagles to trade RB LeSean McCoy to Bills for LB Kiko Alonso." WOW
@ResSports very good show thus far
@SportsCenter well that was stupid
@ResSports that exact feeling is rampant among the current generation
Rock is so dead it's absurd.
@ResSports you're right man. I just hate them so much
@ResSports it hurts my soul to agree with you
@ResSports thank you for asking #boss
The best part of today is we have 3 more hours of @philsimmsquotes
@ResSports I wish I could like this again
@ResSports @philsimmsquotes this is fantastic!
CJ Anderson is trying to will this team to a win
@ResSports top 5 RB next year
@ResSports Chris Christie size pants
@ResSports haters gunna hate
@ResSports @The305MVP sickening
@ResSports not to mention its a tired conversation. Even the causal boxing fan is disinterested
@therealvohdin @ResSports jäger bombs
@ResSports @therealvohdin he won't make it past next week
Watch Rex go to a team like Atlanta and take them to the big dance. #NYJets #youhearditherefirst
Understatement. The @nyjets problems start at the top RT@RichCimini: Woody Johnson acccepts blame: "I have to get a lot better." #nyjets
Sad to see Rex go. Did wonders with a secondary that was college replacement level. Unfortunately he has zero clue about offense. #NYJets
No one deserved to be canned more than idzik. He grossly over estimated the talent on the offensive line and the secondary. #NYJets
The @nyjets have been rebuilding since 1969. So this "not winning" stuff is BS.
@ResSports no new friends
Jay cutler is not good at the sport of football. #MNF #NOvsCHI #youjustlostmethefantasyplayoffs
This game is pathetic. #idratherwatchthejets
Laces out Dan! #NOvsCHI #MNF #finkleiseinhorn #einhornisfinkle
Defensive backs are at such a disadvantage in today's NFL. Such BS #nofunleague
@ResSports I want Pennington as OC
@ResSports jets need an overhaul on an organizational level. Front office, GM, coach. Get rid of 'em all. Completely new regime top 2 bottom
@ResSports I gotta stay with my team dude. It's in my blood. Couldn't change even if I wanted to
@ResSports setting football back 40yrs
@ResSports average qb in a good system. He was bound to have a clunker. He's a guy who needs a strong run game. Won't do it on his own.
@ResSports i spent 4 years saying those exact words
@thee_msquared @mendoza31v this IS week 1 of the playoffs. So she kind of already made it
@ResSports @Dave_Ust Loyola as a D1 national championship. How many does UT-Chattanooga have?
@ResSports the mud dawgs are in the bourbon bowl?!?!
@MLB @Rangers @toriihunter48
@ResSports even when my team is winning I'm angry
Just when you thought it was safe to go back to watching MNF... The jets are on... #ithinkwe'regonnaneedabiggerbeer  #MIAvsNYJ
@ResSports bruuuuuuuuce!
@thee_msquared nothin to it but do it.
@ResSports want some tissues for all that crying you're doing?
@ResSports guess that means you're playing fantasy football for another year
So the jets suck huh?
@thee_msquared haha yeah you're team is looking solid both this week and for the big dance. It's a long shot for me this week.
@thee_msquared what's the matter? That 31 points beckham put up on you giving you nightmares?
@ResSports remember that time a Cowboys lineman killed someone and two years later is now back in the league.
@thee_msquared turndownforwatt in first! And deckerlikerice has made a helluva come back! Interesting year so far!
Garbage time still counts Cutler! #MNF #FantasyFootball #desperateforawin
@therealvohdin @Giants I had to have a talk with him. I don't tolerate dropped passes on my fantasy team
@therealvohdin @Giants agree. Need to get your boy beckham in the game
@therealvohdin @Giants #whyyouinabadmood?
@ResSports until the jets can figure out how to develop a qb they will never be good. I don't care who you end up drafting
@ResSports system/coaching makes all the difference. Said it before Sanchez is an average Qb that would have been fine with a good system.
@ResSports @FauxJohnMadden that's the jets season in a nutshell
@ResSports conundrum. That's gotta be good for 6 points in fantasy SAT vocabulary
@ResSports they should just let jimmy graham play QB and have him throw it to himself
@ResSports @NHLDevils zink!
@ResSports something about this stinks. Could use some cologne. #imhereallnight
@ResSports say what one more god damn time
@ResSports they should tell
GENO the game is in London next week
@ResSports take him out
Maybe if I drink enough the #nyjets will look good
@ResSports I've never been so productive on a Sunday morning. 930am football is the greatest thing.
@ResSports 
@ResSports #tooeasy
@ResSports hello? 
@ResSports what the hell is a Moc?
Zing! RT@ResSports: I bet Geno Smith watched Annabelle at the movies. If he can stomach that Jets offense every week, nothing can scare him.
@thee_msquared they tried really hard to blow it for you
Hide yo' pet vick's a jet! #Jets #terrible
RU baby! Michigan may be mediocre at best but huge win for the scarlet Knights! #collegefootball #RU #MICHvsRUTG #upandcoming
@therealvohdin hey bill! Why you in a bad mood?
@therealvohdin @NFL_Memes guess it's time to call it quits
@thee_msquared Mendoza vsMendoza/Jacobi vs Jacobi.
BURN RT@CHarrisESPN: Best night Doug Martin has had in about two years.
@ResSports @OfficialReview but that's none of my business
This might be the worst football game I've ever seen. #pathetic #TNF #buckssucks #TBvsATL
@ResSports 
@ResSports I heard he's in witness protection
@ResSports he's chillin with garçon at the bar. Someone should have told them their respective games were at 1pm today
@ResSports heard he got a DUI after celebrating the lifting of his suspension
Don't worry folks he'll play in 2 wks RT@TMZ: Ray Rice -- ELEVATOR KNOCKOUT ... Fiancee Takes Crushing Punch (Video) 
@thee_msquared t minus 7 hours and 37 mins. Better get your game up!
@ResSports end of a stellar draft class
@ResSports really hurting some fantasy baseball teams on top of his real-life team.
@SportsCenter what about Lucas Duda?!? No love for the 9th inning hr?!?!?
@thee_msquared Deutschland uber alles!
@thee_msquared die mannschaft!
@ResSports I mean Ireland?
@ResSports viva Mexico!
@ResSports I wish I could like this again

@ResSports die mannschaft!
I believe! #USMNT #USAvsBEL #WorldCup2014
@ResSports I've heard great things about it. Definitely going to get on it
@ResSports 120 degrees 70% humidity! Absurd
Gotta keep it up in the 2nd half. #UMNT RT@Espngreeny: Hanging so damn tough. I love this team. #USA
"....with ever fiber of my being I believe!" #USMNT #WorldCup2014
@ResSports I believe!

I believe that we will win! #USMNT #USA #WorldCup2014
All about Die mannschaft today! Need a huge win or a tie! Let's go Deutschland!!! #WorldCup2014 #Deutschland #GhanavsGermany #USA
Who knew the cool-aid man was a chile fan!?! #ohhhhyyyeeeaaahh #WorldCup2014 #Chile
Let's go USA! Get that 3 points! #USMNT
Sad to hear about Tony Gwynn's passing. Tragic to lose someone so young. Dude could rake, and was a class act. He will be missed #RIP #mlb
Glad to see die deutsche laid the smack down on Portugal. Now I just need the US to do the same to Ghana!
Hold on to your butts
@ResSports I'm all for him wearing green, just a different shade. #nyjets
@ResSports the fact that Klinsman is saying they have no shot is pathetic. If you set out for failure that's all you will ever achieve.
@ResSports it takes effort to win that award dude.... Well worth the money
@ResSports dude the mets cut him. And they roster bobby Abreu...
@ResSports they should pick up Jose Valverde. I hear he's in need of a job.
Game 7 baby!!!! Let's go hawks!
KAAAAAANNNEEEE!
I wonder if anyone told the pacers that the game started at 830
Let's go hawks!
@ResSports let's get that W
Ah the mets RT@karabellespn: It's quite hard to believe that a big league team actually thinks Bobby Abreu can play the outfield effectively
Yes please RT@ChrisJohnson28: Let's bring Andre johnson to the jets legooo
Hahahaha RT@jemelehill: After this pitch, 50 Cent needs to be called 15 cent. My word. 
@ResSports I wish I could like this again
Guess what day it is! Guess. What. Day. It. Is. #DraftDay #nfl #bestsportintheworld
@ResSports no new memes, we don't feel that
@ResSports is it bad that I picture him tinkering with the NFL like it's his own personal fantasy league?
@ResSports No Fun League
@ResSports so glad he's a met...... Where's Armando Benitez when you need him
Clear eyes. Full heart. Can't lose.
The NFL is stupid “@ESPNNFL: With players being penalized for goal post dunks, the "No Fun League" strikes again. &gt; 
Just watched American Hustle; fairly unimpressed.
@ResSports yeah... I guess we'll just have to let it play out....
@ResSports the crazy part is V thinks it's a bad signing! She's crazy! In other news, the jets have signed two people... Two!
@ResSports that makes two of us
@ResSports you would
Dude played his ass off all year. Much deserved. MT@SportsCenter: Jets DT Sheldon Richardson named defensive rookie of the year
@ResSports that interview was painful. He clearly was uncomfortable. Why force him to sit through it? Unnecessary
@GaryRacich How could anyone even be outside in that weather!? It's definitely going to effect the quality of play #Sarcasm #overreaction
@GaryRacich it's really absurd! Games get played in the cold all the time. Grow a pair and get over it.
You know what the call a SuperBowl played in 25*F? Football. So tired of how blown out of proportion this weather is. #SuperBowlXLVIII
"If you find some treasures, make sure you save them and give them back to me." Things patients say before colonoscopies
@ResSports @AdamSchefter if we're going to play this game Sanchez has 4 road playoff wins. Tied for MOST in NFL  #overreaction #uselessstat
@thee_msquared white man can't jump #nottop10
@AGFeher @ResSports he needs to be an OC somewhere. Great offensive mind. Would be a great hire by any football team
@ResSports Anyone who can have a billion legitimate children and still get up for a football game like he does is as intense as they come
@thee_msquared Andy dalton happened
@ResSports 4th and 3!? Just run something to get the first down! Instead you throw the long ball in double coverage? Unbelievable
@ResSports I hope his post-fight interviews, his coors lite and his wife come with him
@ResSports don't disagree but the Dallas secondary is awful.
Decisions, decisions: Jennings, Hilton or Ellington at flex? .5ppr #FFNow
@ESPNNFL @criscarter80 RGIII- don't worry, I found him. He's on the bench
So happy for Mike Ditka. Such a long time coming.
@MatthewBerryTMR Reece or Hilton @ flex in .5ppr?
@TriviumOfficial Was a serious disappointment. Play more old shit damn it
That was the greatest thing I've ever seen. This is why you take the point. #BAMAvsAUB
Fumblitis outbreak in New England! Hide yo' kids, hide yo' wife! #DENvsNE #needsomestick'em
@thee_msquared that's so lame... You actually had a decent week. Chris' team just decided to explode!
@thee_msquared oh no! He's been so solid too!
@ResSports truth
Jimmy graham has played 3 snaps so far.... #feedjimmy #DALvsNO #ineedpoints
@ResSports the track with Kendrick is pretty solid also
@ResSports there's an alpaca farm around the corner from you we could hit up next weekend.
@ResSports when, AP's case, I don't think anyone would fault him for. The qb play in Minnesota is something awful
@ResSports what even better is that they are no nonsense guys. You don't see them yelling at their qb or TE like Dez Bryant
@ResSports don't forget the tissues for all that cryin' you're doing
@ResSports hey, Golden Corral is too classy for that
@GaryRacich it's no joke
Wow. Shocking... RT@ESPNNFL: The Redskins, Giants, Falcons and Steelers are a combined 2-16.
Poetic “@ResSports: Justin Verlander is flithier than a dumpster full of diapers.”
Evanston must be going wild! Wish I was there right now. #GoCats #collegegameday #whatthehellisabuckeye
@thee_msquared god I hope you do.... I'm so tired of seeing his ass win
@thee_msquared MJD but it's close. The jags are awful
@ResSports should have gone to the OR a month ago
@ResSports and then he ran for a 50 yard td.
@thee_msquared my fault.....
@GaryRacich what a great effin song
Starks or Hilton at flex #FFNow
@NFLfantasy oh didn't you hear? He decided to take the day off
It's painful to watch RT@MatthewBerryTMR: Just because they paid him 56 million doesn't mean they have to use him, you guys. #Bowe
@ResSports Sanchez time has nearly expired
And Sanchez fumbles the snap... #typical #longseason #nyjets
Andddd he throws a pick RT @ESPNNFL: SANCHEZ INT ALERT: In the endzone. #predictable #Jets
Wes who? Amendola looking like a high end fantasy WR2 early in this one. #FantasyFootball  #TBvsNE #footballisback #greatestsportonearth
"Jackman, I added more sideburns! It's perfect!"
This RT. @SportsCenter: 12-year-old Ohio State fan Grant Reed nicknamed the cancer tumor in his brain "Michigan"... then he beat it.
Sanchez's butt fumble is a 30 time #worstoftheworst champion &amp; he's likely to be the starter this year #theresalwaysnextyear #2014NFLDraft
@ResSports #toosoon?
@GaryRacich CRUNCH WRAP
@ResSports he's guilty. He'll go to jail a Tight End and he'll leave a wide receiver
Guess what day it is!
@ResSports that's a classic!
HAHAHA RT@ResSports: Documentary film maker Billy Corben with @ESPN_Colin: "Forget 30 for 30. Aaron Hernandez is looking at 15 to 30.

This game is incredible #knickspacers #rainingthrees
@ResSports @NFL_ATL I heard Mark Sanchez threw Tim Tebow a going away party but it was intercepted and returned for a Touchdown
@ResSports no argument here. They won't win a SB in my lifetime.
@ResSports don't call it a come back
And the Jets won't win 5 games... RT@AdamSchefter: As former Jets HC Herm Edwards said, "This is now Mark Sanchez's job to lose."”
@ResSports it will be the new sports "curse".
@ResSports ugh... That's miserable... You have the flight to get done sleep then it's game time.
@ResSports the only thing that could possibly make that drive worse is bad weather.... Oh wait...
When you're right you're right. Well said RT @NFL_ATL: Mike Ditka: Jets' season 'was a joke' and 'so is their team' 
Not a Tebow fan but the #NYJets screwed him. The way thr season was going they should've given him a shot. Glad to see he gets a fresh start
@ResSports he went to the perfect team too. No need to rush back and he can learn behind Gore.
Khaseem Greene heading to Chi-town. Couldn't be happier for him #RU #jerseystrong
@ResSports also Fitz will keep him in line
@ResSports I think Chip Kelly is the type of coach that could have gotten through to him too
#RU RT@AdamSchefter: Patriots love them some Rutgers. In third round, Patriots took Rutgers CB Logan Ryan and Rutgers S Duron Harmon.
@ResSports couldn't agree more. If that dude keeps himself in check he could be a serious steal
Truth. RT@ResSports: The Patriots love them some Rutgers corners.
GENO!!!!!!!!!! #welcometoNY
@ResSports let's see if fat Rex screw this up #typicaljets
@ResSports z-ach clap clap clap er-tz clap clap clap
@ResSports should have paid Revis

@ResSports jets trading back into 1st rd? Yes please
Bad pick by @nyjets. Could have traded back and still gotten him Or could have drafted Star #mistake #herewegoagain #typical

@ResSports why do you think they put the clearance section so close to the exit?
@ResSports OH MY BOSH!
@ResSports draft party Thursday? I get to watch the Jets miss on two more draft picks. It's must see TV.
